      		<p><orgName key="Rivolta Femminile" ref="http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q85882229">Rivolta Femminile</orgName> is an Italian group of radical
      		feminists founded in <placeName key="Rome" ref="http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q220">Rome</placeName> in July 1970, now
      		associated with other feminist groups in <placeName key="Milan" ref="http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q490"><placeName key="Milan" ref="http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q490">Milan</placeName></placeName>,

They have consistently resisted hierarchal structures and male
      		dominated institutions and their development
      		of feminist theory has been detailed in publications such as <persName key="Carla Lonzi" ref="http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q3658850">Carla Lonzi</persName>'s <title key="Sputiamo su Hegel" ref="http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q42245141">Sputiamo su Hegel</title>

				<div><p>We in Rivolta Femminile refuse to pay tribute
				to male creativity because we are aware that in
				the patriarchal world—that is, in a world made
				by men and for men—even the liberating force of creativity is the prerogative of men. Woman—in so many ways a subsidiary being—is
				denied every role which could effect à recognition of these inequities. For her, there is no
				prospect of liberation.</p>
				<p>The creativity of men speaks to the creativity
				of other men while woman, as client and spectator of that dialogue, is assigned a status which
				excludes competition. Woman is locked into a
				role which, a priori, assures the male artist an
				audience. While creating art is seen to have a
				liberating function, art as an institution insists
				that woman be the neutral witness to the work
				of others. Man’s energy, even in art, is spent by
				competing with other men. Only the contemplation of art invites woman's involvement.</p>
				<p>This is the nature of patriarchal creativity: to
				depend upon aggressive competition with male
				rivals and on the passive appreciation of women. Man, the artist, feels abandoned by woman
				as soon as she abandons her archetypal spectator's role; their mutual solidarity rests solely on
					<pb facs="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BucknellDSC/heresies/main/issue01/images/01_103.jpg"/> the conviction that, as a spectator gratified by
				creativity, woman reaches the highest possible
				point in the evolution of her species.</p>
				<p>But, on the contrary, woman is discovering
				that the patriarchal world needs her—that
				man's self-liberating efforts absolutely depend
				on her—and that woman's liberation can only
				be realized independent of patriarchal previsions and the dynamics by which men liberate
				themselves. The artist depends upon woman to
				glorify his work and she, until she begins her
				own liberation, is happy to oblige. The work of
				art cannot afford to lose the security inherent in
				her exclusively receptive role.</p>
				<p>Once aware of her position in relation to
				male creativity, woman is left with two possibilities: the first—until now, the only available
				option—of distinguishing herself within the creative hierarchy historically defined by men
				(which alienates her from other women while
				men recognize her only indulgently); or—the
				feminist alternative—of autonomously recover
				ing her own creativity, nourished by her awareness of past oppression.</p>
				<p>To celebrate male creativity is ultimately to
				submit to the historic sovereignty of men, to
				that patriarchal strategy which deliberately subjugates us. But let woman remove herself, and
				the struggle for male supremacy becomes not
				man lording it over woman, but merely a struggle between individual men.</p>
				<p>By refusing to celebrate male creativity, we
				are not judging creativity, nor are we contesting
				it. Rather, with our absence, we are refusing to
				accept it as defined; we are challenging the
				concept of art as something which men graciously hand down to us. By ceasing to believe
				in a refracted liberation, we are unleashing
				creative energy from patriarchal bonds.</p>
				<p>With her absence, woman performs a dramatic act of awareness, creative because it is liberating.

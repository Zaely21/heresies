				<lb/>The Creat Goddess Collective Statement
				<lb/>In putting together this issue on The Great Goddess/Women’s Spirituality, we wanted to offer a holistic
				<lb/>concept of the Goddess and to move beyond an inside/outside duality. We also recognized a need to counter
				<lb/>the distrust that most women harbor towards religion and any aspect of spirituality because of the oppression
				<lb/>that we have all experienced from patriarchal religions.
				<lb/>During the year that we have been working together, our collective process has passed through several
				<lb/>phases. In the beginning we had meetings attended by 30 or more women, which required us to separate into
				<lb/>committees. The committee division continued to evolve and resulted in three main editorial groupings:
				<lb/>Personal/Ritual/Poetry/Fiction; Archaeological/Historical/Political/Theological; and Visual, which selected
				<lb/>material for submission to the full collective. Initially we attempted to create a review system so that everyone
				<lb/>could have an opportunity to see all submissions. However, some material could not be easily duplicated and
				<lb/>few people made the independent effort to look through the material from other committees. Because we were
				<lb/>committed to the concept of total collective energy and process, we held a marathon weekend on a Long Island
				<lb/>farm where more than 30 women met in a communal atmosphere to review and make recommendations about
				<lb/>submissions. Over the next four months the full collective continued to make selections and often reviewed
				<lb/>rejected material. Committees were engaged in editing, shortening long articles to fit within space limitations,
				<lb/>retyping, phoning and corresponding with contributors and soliciting material. During this intense period,
				<lb/>members often had to attend three and four meetings a week. Our numbers dwindled to about 20
				<lb/>In the next phase we reviewed the editing of accepted pieces and began layout and design of the magazine.
				<lb/>Because we were far behind schedule, a number of women who had worked hard were no longer able to give
				<lb/>priority to their involvement in the collective. Also only a few women were willing to become heavily involved
				<lb/>in production work. Some women pitched in; some women hung in; some women checked in. But, again,
				<lb/>throughout this phase all decisions were open to the full collective at specially arranged meetings. We felt that
				<lb/>we had to make an effort to respect the contributions of all without assessing participation. We did not want to
				<lb/>regard decision-making as a power
				<lb/>There was often muted and, occasionally, dramatic conflict. In a smaller group, confrontation and its
				<lb/>resolution would have had to be more directly resolved, but the size of our group permitted distancing and an
				<lb/>evasion of differences that sometimes left individuals antagonistically engaged or estranged. A basic source of
				<lb/>contention was our disparate definitions of the Goddess. Nor did we find an honest way to handle the implicit
				<lb/>and often explicit coercion involved in submitting our own work. Egotism about individual creations and their
				<lb/>significance/prominence flared. Our own inefficiency and ineptitude wearied us. The work was not equally
				<lb/>shared, although the decision process was. Decision-making in so large a group was extremely slow. Our original
				<lb/>committee division aroused factionalism. Members of committees felt that their subject matter was not being
				<lb/>fully respected by members of other committees and defensive attitudes developed. However, our slowness may
				<lb/>have achieved a greater fairness and even our factionalism may have clarified viewpoints that otherwise would
				<lb/>have been blunted by the consensus-voting process, and right to this moment, we have continued to challenge
				<lb/>ourselves by seeking collective consensus on an infinitude of decisions. We feel that we tested the collective
				<lb/>process and that that process not only produces the most representative work but also withstands the greatest
				<lb/>stresses. Although our sharing must include the knowledge of how we were often divided against ourselves
				<lb/>there were also many good times when we shared a heightened regard for each other, when we felt that we were
				<lb/>touched by the Goddess.
				<lb/>From the Heresies Collective
				<lb/>HERESIES is an idea-oriented journal devoted to the examination of art and politics from a feminist perspective. We believe that what
				<lb/>is commonly called art can have a political impact, and that in the making of art and of all cultural artifacts our identities as women play a
				<lb/>distinct role. We hope that HERESIES will stimulate dialogue around radical political and aesthetic theory, encourage the writing of the
				<lb/>history of femina sapiens, and generate new creative energies among women. It will be a place where diversity can be articulated. We are
				<lb/>committed to the broadening of the definition and function of art
				<lb/>HERESIES is structured as a collective of feminists, some of whom are also socialists, marxists, lesbian feminists or anarchists; oun
				<lb/>fields include painting, sculpture, writing, anthropology, literature, performance, art history, architecture and filmmaking. While the
				<lb/>themes of the individual issues will be determined by the collective, each issue will have a different editorial staff made up of women who
				<lb/>want to work on that issue as well as members of the collective. Proposals for issues may be conceived and presented to the HERESIES
				<lb/>Collective by groups of women not associated with the collective. Each issue will take a different visual form, chosen by the group re
				<lb/>sponsible. HERESlES will try to be accountable to and in touch with the international feminist community. An open evaluation meeting
				<lb/>will be held after the appearance of each issue. Topics for issues will be announced well in advance in order to collect material trom many
				<lb/>sources. Possibly satellite pamphlets and broadsides will be produced continuing the discussion of each central theme. As part of its
				<lb/>commitment to the women’s community, HERESIES provides workshops in all phases of magazine production and maintains the Women
				<lb/>Artists’ Slide Registry
				<lb/>As women, we are aware that historically the connections between our lives, our arts and our ideas have been suppressed. Once these
				<lb/>connections are clarified they can function as a means to dissolve the alienation between artist and audience, and to understand the
				<lb/>relationships between art and politics, work and workers. As a step toward a demystification of art, we reject the standard relationship of
				<lb/>criticism to art within the present system, which has often become the relationship of advertiser to product. We will not advertise a new set
				<lb/>of genius-products just because they are made by women. We are not committed to any particular style or aesthetic, nor to the competi
				<lb/>tive mentality that pervades the art world. Our view of feminism is one of process and change, and we feel that in the process of dialogue
				<lb/>we can foster a change in the meaning of art.

				<lb/>The Three Faces of Goddess Spirituality
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb/>Merlin Stone
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb/>In considering the already widespread and in
				<lb/>creasing interest in the diverse manifestations of
				<lb/>Goddess spirituality within the feminist movement,
				<lb/>it may be helpful to clarify at least three emerging
				<lb/>aspects of this relatively new phenomenon. These
				<lb/>three aspects, of what may be the most unexpected
				<lb/>occurrence within the feminist movement, have de
				<lb/>veloped, separately and together, in a rather incred
				<lb/>ibly organic "grass roots” manner. Perhaps only
				<lb/>within the flexibility of a feminism that is continual
				<lb/>ly evolving out of the process of consciousness rais
				<lb/>ing in its truest sense has this outgrowth of feminist
				<lb/>consciousness been able to develop and grow.
				<lb/>Since all three of these aspects of Goddess spir
				<lb/>ituality appear to be simultaneously growing from
				<lb/>one central trunk, I drew lots (a method used at the
				<lb/>prophecy-providing shrines of the Goddess in an
				<lb/>cient times) to decide their linear placement. This
				<lb/>placement in no way implies that one aspect is of
				<lb/>greater importance than another or precedes the
				<lb/>others in actual development and, as you will see,
				<lb/>many connections link the three.
				<lb/>The first aspect of Goddess spirituality is the
				<lb/>emerging interest in the history and prehistory of
				<lb/>ancient cultures that worshipped a female deity and
				<lb/>in the laws and customs of those societies. Through
				<lb/>research in archaeology, history, anthropology
				<lb/>and using this information to analyze ancient lit
				<lb/>erature and mythology—we have begun to discover
				<lb/>that far from the generally accepted idea that the
				<lb/>Judeo-Christian religions rescued women from sup
				<lb/>posedly more barbarian and anti-woman societies
				<lb/>women have actually lost a great deal of status and
				<lb/>physical and material autonomy since the inceptior
				<lb/>of these and other male-worshipping religions. As a
				<lb/>result of this research, which covers the period fron
				<lb/>the Neolithic Goddess shrines of about 8000 B.C. to
				<lb/>the closing of the last Goddess temples in the early
				<lb/>Christian periods of Byzantium, we have learned
				<lb/>that many Goddess-worshipping societies were mat
				<lb/>rilineal, matrilocal and matrifocal. In many of these
				<lb/>societies, women owned property, engaged in busi
				<lb/>ness and held the highest positions of the clergy. In
				<lb/>such societies children automatically belonged to
				<lb/>their mother’s clan and took their mother’s family
				<lb/>name.
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb/>Through this research we are discovering the
				<lb/>roots of today’s attitudes toward women’s bodies
				<lb/>and minds. These attitudes become clear as we
				<lb/>study them within the context of the original institu
				<lb/>tion of patrilineal, patrilocal and patrifocal systems
				<lb/>under the aegis of the worship of a supreme deity as
				<lb/>male. Though it required many millennia tosuppress
				<lb/>the Goddess religion and its social customs, this
				<lb/>ancient religion was eventually designated as "pa
				<lb/>gan” and its remaining vestiges were obliterated by
				<lb/>early Christian emperors, medieval inquisitions and
				<lb/>witch burnings
				<lb/>In our growing interest and efforts to explore the
				<lb/>truth about the past, we are building, and hopefully
				<lb/>we will continue to build, a body of evidence that
				<lb/>bears witness to the many millennia in which the
				<lb/>Creator was regarded as female and in which womer
				<lb/>held a much higher status than we have known since
				<lb/>that time. This aspect of Goddess spirituality within
				<lb/>the feminist movement is motivated by much the
				<lb/>same feeling that has encouraged us to rediscover
				<lb/>and reclaim female artists, writers, scientists, polit
				<lb/>ical leaders and other important women who were
				<lb/>ignored by the writers of the history books with
				<lb/>which we were educated. This information affords
				<lb/>an entirely new perspective on current stereotypes
				<lb/>of women. It provides a broader view, as the per
				<lb/>spective which allows us to look into the past also
				<lb/>allows us to see further ahead.
				<lb/>The second aspect is that of a growing concern
				<lb/>with a feminist perception of spirituality and theol
				<lb/>ogy. It has emerged from feminist consciousness, an
				<lb/>inkling or more of the first aspect and the perhaps
				<lb/>ever-present search for answers to such theological
				<lb/>questions as the possible purposes (or nonpurpose,
				<lb/>of existence, the true nature of morality (or im
				<lb/>morality), birth, death and the nature of mind as it is
				<lb/>revealed in intelligence, intuition and reason. For
				<lb/>many centuries women have been taught that if they
				<lb/>cared to consider these questions at all (the implica
				<lb/>tion being that such questions were actually too
				<lb/>abstract for female minds), answers were to be
				<lb/>found in the words and writings of male priests
				<lb/>male ministers, male rabbis and male gurus —all of
				<lb/>whom supposedly had greater spiritually contem
				<lb/>plative abilities as well as more direct access to
				<lb/>knowledge of The Divine Plan or Cosmic Process.
			</p>
			
			<pb n='3'/>
			<p>
				<lb/>A feminist contemplation of spiritual and theo
				<lb/>logical questions soon makes us painfully aware that
				<lb/>the answers with which we have so far been provid
				<lb/>ed have existed in close relationship to, or more
				<lb/>often within, a personified Life Force that is nearly
				<lb/>always linguistically, and more often actually, con
				<lb/>sidered to be of the male gender. Not too surprising
				<lb/>ly, "answers” about divine intentions are often as
				<lb/>male-oriented as the men who provide them. The
				<lb/>exceptional rate of growth of feminist concerns with
				<lb/>Goddess spirituality in itself reveals a level of con
				<lb/>sciousness that refuses and refutes this male-de
				<lb/>signed hierarchy and its appropriation of theological
				<lb/>and spiritual considerations—and the subsequent
				<lb/>divine” decrees.
				<lb/>So far, and let us hope in the future as well, fem
				<lb/>inists concerned with Goddess spirituality have sel
				<lb/>dom offered absolute or pat answers to theological
				<lb/>questions. What has been happening is the experi
				<lb/>encing, and at times the reporting, of these personal
				<lb/>or group experiences: how it feels to regard the Ul
				<lb/>timate Life Force in our own image—as females;
				<lb/>how it feels to openly embrace and to share our own
				<lb/>contemplations and intuitive knowledge about the
				<lb/>role of women on this planet; how it feels to gain a
				<lb/>sense of direction, a motivating energy, a strength, a
				<lb/>courage—somehow intuited as coming from a cos
				<lb/>mic female energy force that fuels and refuels us in
				<lb/>our struggle against all human oppression and
				<lb/>planetary destruction.
				<lb/>Some say they find this force within themselves
				<lb/>others regard it as external. Some feel it in the
				<lb/>ocean, the moon, a tree, the flight of a bird or in the
				<lb/>constant stream of coincidences (or noncoin
				<lb/>cidences) that occur in our lives. Some find access
				<lb/>to it in the lighting of a candle, chanting, meditating
				<lb/>— alone or with other women. From what 1 have so
				<lb/>far read, heard or experienced myself, I think it safe
				<lb/>to say that all women who feel they have experi
				<lb/>enced Goddess spirituality in one way or another al
				<lb/>so feel that they have gained an inner strength and
				<lb/>direction that temporarily or permanently has
				<lb/>helped them to deal with life. Most women interest
				<lb/>ed or involved in feminist concepts of spirituality do
				<lb/>not regard this spirituality as an end in itself but as a
				<lb/>means of gaining and giving strength and under
				<lb/>standing that will help us to confront the many
				<lb/>tangible and material issues of the blatant inequities
				<lb/>of society as we know it today
				<lb/>The third aspect of Goddess spirituality is con
				<lb/>cerned with the more circumspect observation of
				<lb/>the organized male-worshipping, male-clergied
				<lb/>religions of today—an examination of the specific
				<lb/>ways in which these religions have instituted and
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb/>maintained a secondary status for women. Involve
				<lb/>ment in Goddess spirituality has encouraged us to
				<lb/>take a more careful look at the scriptures, rituals and
				<lb/>the gender of the decision-making level of the clergy
				<lb/>of the religions in which we were raised and/or
				<lb/>those that affect the society in which we live.
				<lb/>Some of the most urgent issues confronting con
				<lb/>temporary women all over the planet are those con
				<lb/>cerning economic survival, abortion, contraception,
				<lb/>rape, clitorectomy, infibulation, divorce, attitudes
				<lb/>toward "illegitimacy”, lesbian rights, social pressure
				<lb/>to marry and to have children, physical and psycho
				<lb/>logical violence, attitudes toward women’s bodies
				<lb/>and the stereotypes of woman as follower rather
				<lb/>than leader and sexual and reproductive being rather
				<lb/>than as total human being.
				<lb/>A careful reading of the Bible still used by Judeo
				<lb/>Christian congregations reveals the ancient origins
				<lb/>of many of these important feminist issues. The
				<lb/>proclamation in Gen. 3:16 informs both women and
				<lb/>men that women are expected, as the result of a
				<lb/>divine” decree, to be sexually faithful and subser
				<lb/>vient to their husbands and that the pains of child
				<lb/>birth are to be regarded as "divine” retribution —the
				<lb/>will of God” as it is asserted over the will of woman.
				<lb/>Deut. 22:28,29 requires that a raped virgin be mar
				<lb/>ried to the man who raped her. Deut. 22:22-24 stip
				<lb/>ulates that a raped betrothed woman should be put
				<lb/>to death (unless the rape occurred in the deserted
				<lb/>countryside). Deut. 22:20-22 states that a bride dis
				<lb/>covered not to be a virgin should be dragged from
				<lb/>the house and stoned to death. Deut. 22:22 declares
				<lb/>that a married woman should be put to death if
				<lb/>found lying with a man (no excuse for rape is men
				<lb/>tioned). Deut. 24:1 decrees that a man has the right
				<lb/>to divorce his wife on his decision alone, while no
				<lb/>provision is made for a woman who desires to
				<lb/>divorce her husband. Each of these biblical laws re
				<lb/>veals the intense efforts made to control reproduc
				<lb/>tive capacities, and thus the sexual activities of
				<lb/>women, by the men who wrote these laws and by
				<lb/>those who followed them.
				<lb/>Our understanding and analysis of these biblical
				<lb/>laws and their subsequent effects on contemporary
				<lb/>women become clear only in the context of histor
				<lb/>ical information which reveals that these laws were
				<lb/>devised at much the same time that matrilineal cus
				<lb/>toms were being destroyed and patrilineal systems
				<lb/>initiated. In a patrilineal system, knowledge of
				<lb/>paternity is vital. This knowledge takes on even
				<lb/>greater import when the system is declared to be an
				<lb/>integral aspect of The Divine Plan and thus any chal
				<lb/>lenge to the patrilineal system and certain knowl
				<lb/>edge of paternity may be considered blasphemy—at
			</p>
			<pb n='4'/>
			<p>
				<lb/>times punishable by death. Even today, socio
				<lb/>religious attitudes toward "unwed mothers” and "il
				<lb/>legitimacy” have not yet been thoroughly examined
				<lb/>and challenged as a vital feminist issue.
				<lb/>The institution and maintenance of a patrilineal
				<lb/>system were further abetted by biblical laws such as
				<lb/>Num. 30 requiring that a daughter’s or a wife’s vow
				<lb/>must be regarded as null and void unless confirmed
				<lb/>by father or husband—making it impossible for most
				<lb/>women to engage in business activities and thus lim
				<lb/>iting their access to economic autonomy. Num. 27
				<lb/>explains that the rights to family inheritance are ac
				<lb/>cesssible only to sons, unless there are no male
				<lb/>heirs, and Num. 36 decrees that if a woman does
				<lb/>inherit in such a situation, she must then marry only
				<lb/>within her father’s tribe. Written about 3,000 years
				<lb/>ago, these laws still exist in the Old Testament of the
				<lb/>Judeo-Christian Bible. Though the last few genera
				<lb/>tions may have forgotten or rejected these laws, can
				<lb/>we afford to ignore them in our efforts to understand
				<lb/>the origins of attitudes toward women as wage
				<lb/>earners today?
				<lb/>Judeo-Christian laws and decrees have deeply af
				<lb/>fected the secular laws and attitudes of our contem
				<lb/>porary patrilineal society. All too often we discover
				<lb/>them to be the probable origins of many of the prob
				<lb/>lems we face today such as the right of each woman
				<lb/>to be able to control her own physical body and its
				<lb/>functions; access to abortion; in some countries, ac
				<lb/>cess to contraception and divorce; the concept of
				<lb/>"illegitimacy” and the social and legal pressures sur
				<lb/>rounding it; social and legal attitudes on lesbian
				<lb/>love; physical violence against women, stereotypes
				<lb/>of whore and madonna; double standards for pre
				<lb/>marital virginity and marital fidelity; attitudes toward
				<lb/>women’s access to earning power (including choice
				<lb/>of vocation, education, advancement in chosen
				<lb/>field and levels of economic recompense) and the
				<lb/>so-called "natural” assumption of male leadership
				<lb/>in political, intellectual and spiritual spheres
				<lb/>Each of these issues is an anger-provoking re
				<lb/>minder of the longstanding power of male-oriented,
				<lb/>male-dominated religions. It is for this reason that it
				<lb/>is vital to fully understand the connections between
				<lb/>these attitudes, biblical laws and the initial institu
				<lb/>tion of the patrilineal system in which we live. The
				<lb/>supremacy of “Father in Heaven” is a mere reflec
				<lb/>tion of the supremacy of "father on earth”. The
				<lb/>status of father is magnified beyond biological re
				<lb/>ality by the patrilineal system and it is this system
				<lb/>that is the underlying foundation of all patriarchal
				<lb/>ideas and actions. Refusing to acknowledge paternal
				<lb/>identity may be one of the most revolutionary acts
				<lb/>possible.
				<lb/>Even today, the absence or extreme minority of
				<lb/>women in decision-making levels of the clergy of
				<lb/>nearly all Jewish, Catholic, and Protestant congrega
				<lb/>tions ensures that these biblical decrees and sub
				<lb/>sequent attitudes will retain their original power.
				<lb/>Perhaps more important, we must remember that
				<lb/>biblical laws and attitudes have extended far beyond
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb/>the walls of any specific church or temple and are
				<lb/>now deeply embedded within so-called secular law
				<lb/>and social custom. Despite the supposed separa
				<lb/>tion of church and state, women’s demands in early
				<lb/>feminist struggles for women’s suffrage were contin
				<lb/>ually challenged and obstructed by clergymen who
				<lb/>claimed sole access to knowledge of The Divine
				<lb/>Plan—and women voting was not part of it.
				<lb/>It is also of interest that along with sexist atti
				<lb/>tudes, racism and slavery were justified by the "re
				<lb/>ligious” idea that heathens had no souls—thus al
				<lb/>lowing "good" Christians to invade the land of the
				<lb/>Native Americans, decimating them as a people and
				<lb/>appropriating their property, and to kidnap Africans
				<lb/>and to use them as slaves. Male-oriented religion's
				<lb/>more passive acceptance of racism is still to be seen
				<lb/>in the racial segregation of churches.
				<lb/>Goddess spirituality offers us the immediate and
				<lb/>inherent refutation of the institutionalized "re
				<lb/>ligious” values that have for too long been used as
				<lb/>weapons of oppression. From this third aspect of
				<lb/>Goddess spirituality grows the consciousness of, and
				<lb/>the direct challenge to, these “religious” laws and
				<lb/>attitudes that have played such a large part in for
				<lb/>mulating the roles of women in contemporary
				<lb/>society
				<lb/>In all of its aspects, Goddess spirituality has
				<lb/>grown from our continually feeling, speaking, com
				<lb/>paring, analyzing, feminist-consciousness-raising
				<lb/>process—the very core of our new perceptions and
				<lb/>thus our motivating energies. Our consciousness has
				<lb/>now been raised—to the point where we can no
				<lb/>longer ignore the suppression or perversion of
				<lb/>evidence on the roles of women in the ancient God
				<lb/>dess-worshipping cultures; the trivializing of wom
				<lb/>en’s thoughts and ideas on spiritual and theological
				<lb/>considerations of existence, from personal to
				<lb/>planetary; and the oppression of women as it has
				<lb/>been instituted and maintained within the patrilin
				<lb/>eal, male-worshipping religions and the effect this
				<lb/>has had on society.
				<lb/>Though some may want to question the political
				<lb/>viability of Goddess spirituality within the feminist
				<lb/>struggle, few would deny its existence within the
				<lb/>feminist community or the reality of the existence of
				<lb/>the many contributors to this issue (those included
				<lb/>as well as those whose work was not included as a
				<lb/>result of space limitations). We invite you, as a read
				<lb/>er of this issue of Heresies, not only to view or read
				<lb/>the many thoughts and ideas that are included but
				<lb/>to consider them in light of our ever-expanding fem
				<lb/>inist consciousness, that same consciousness that
				<lb/>has until now helped us to avoid the undigested ac
				<lb/>ceptance of other, usually male-developed political
				<lb/>analyses (party lines). Goddess spirituality has
				<lb/>grown from our consciousness-raising process; it has
				<lb/>grown from US. It may be the ultimate heresy—and
				<lb/>it may ultimately be what allows us to succeed
				<lb/>where so many others have failed.

				<lb/>Why Women Need the Coddess

			<p>
				<lb/>At the close of Ntosake Shange’s stupendously success
				<lb/>ful Broadway play For Colored Cirls Who Have Con
				<lb/>sidered Suicide When the Rainbow Is Enuf, a tall beautiful
				<lb/>Black woman rises from despair to cry out, "l found God
				<lb/>in myself and 1 loved her fiercely.”1 Her discovery is
				<lb/>echoed by women around the country who meet spon
				<lb/>taneously in small groups on full moons, solstices anc
				<lb/>equinoxes to celebrate the Goddess as symbol of life and
				<lb/>death powers and waxing and waning energies in the
				<lb/>universe and in themselves.2
				<lb/>It is the night of the full moon. Nine women stand in a
				<lb/>circle, on a rocky hill above the city. The western sky i
				<lb/>rosy with the setting sun; in the east the moon’s face begins
				<lb/>to peer above the horizon. .. The woman pours a cup of
				<lb/>wine onto the earth, refills it and raises it high. “Hail Tana,
				<lb/>Mother of Mothers!" she cries. "Awaken from your long
				<lb/>sleep, and return to your children again!"3
				<lb/>What are the political and psychological effects of this
				<lb/>fierce new love of the divine in themselves on women
				<lb/>whose previous spiritual experience has been focusec
				<lb/>upon the male God of Judaism and Christianity? Is the
				<lb/>spiritual dimension of feminism a passing diversion, an
				<lb/>escape from difficult but necessary political work? Or
				<lb/>does the emergence of the symbol of Goddess among
				<lb/>women have significant political and psychological ram
				<lb/>ifications for the feminist movement?
				<lb/>To answer these questions, we must first understand
				<lb/>the importance of religious symbols and rituals in human
				<lb/>life. According to anthropologist Clifford Geertz religious
				<lb/>symbols shape a cultural ethos, defining the deepest
				<lb/>values of a society and the persons in it. “Religion,
				<lb/>Geertz writes, "is a system of symbols which act to pro
				<lb/>duce powerful, pervasive, and long-lasting moods and
				<lb/>motivations”“ in the people of a given culture. A "mood
				<lb/>for Geertz is a psychological attitude such as awe, trust or
				<lb/>respect, while a “motivation” is the social and political
				<lb/>trajectory created by a mood which transforms mythos
				<lb/>into ethos, symbol system into social and political reality.
				<lb/>Symbols have both psychological and political effects be
				<lb/>cause they create the inner conditions (deep-seated at
				<lb/>titudes and féelings) which lead people to feel com
				<lb/>fortable with or to accept social and political arrange
				<lb/>ments that correspond to the symbol system. Because
				<lb/>religion has such a compelling hold on the deep psyches
				<lb/>of so many people, feminists cannot afford to leave it in
				<lb/>the hands of the fathers. Even people who no longer "be
				<lb/>lieve in God" or participate in the institutional structure
				<lb/>of patriarchal religion still may not be free of the power of
				<lb/>the symbolism of God the Father. A symbol’s effect is not
				<lb/>dependent on rational assent, for a symbol also functions
				<lb/>on levels of the psyche other than the rational. Religion
				<lb/>fulfills deep psychic needs by providing symbols and
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb/>rituals which enable people to cope with difficult situa
				<lb/>tions? in human life (e.g., death, evil, suffering) and to
				<lb/>pass through life’s important transitions (e.g., birth, mar
				<lb/>riage, death). Even people who consider themselves com
				<lb/>pletely secularized will often find themselves sitting in a
				<lb/>church or synagogue when a friend or relative gets mar
				<lb/>ried, or when a parent or friend dies. The symbols associ
				<lb/>ated with these important rituals cannot fail to affect the
				<lb/>deep or unconscious structures of the mind of even a per
				<lb/>son who has rejected these symbolisms on a conscious
				<lb/>level—especially if that person is under stress. The reason
				<lb/>for the continuing effect of religious symbols is that the
				<lb/>mind is uncomfortable with a vacuum. Symbol systems
				<lb/>cannot simply be rejected, they must be replaced. I be
				<lb/>lieve where there is no replacement, the mind will revert
				<lb/>to familiar structures at times of crisis, bafflement or
				<lb/>defeat
				<lb/>Religions centered on the worship of a male God keep
				<lb/>women in a childish state of psychological dependence
				<lb/>on men and male authority, and at the same time legit
				<lb/>imate the political and social authority of fathers and sons
				<lb/>in the institutions of society. The damage done to women
				<lb/>by exclusively male symbolism in religion and culture is
				<lb/>both psychological and political: women feel their own
				<lb/>power is inferior or dangerous and they therefore give
				<lb/>over their will to male authority figures in family and
				<lb/>society.
				<lb/>Religious symbol systems focused on exclusively male
				<lb/>images of divinity are psychologically devastating to
				<lb/>women because they create the impression that female
				<lb/>This message need never be explicitly stated (as for ex
				<lb/>ample it is in the story of Eve) for its effect to be felt. A
				<lb/>woman completely ignorant of the myths of female evil in
				<lb/>Biblical religion nonetheless acknowledges the anomaly
				<lb/>of female power when she prays exclusively to a male
				<lb/>God. She may see herself as like God (created in the
				<lb/>image of God) by denying her own sexual identity and
				<lb/>affirming God’s transcendence of sexual identity, but she
				<lb/>can never have the experience which is freely available to
				<lb/>every man and boy in her culture, of having her full sexual
				<lb/>identity affirmed as being in the image and likeness of
				<lb/>God. Her mood is one of trust in male power as salvific
				<lb/>and distrust of female power in herself and other womer
				<lb/>as inferior or dangerous. Such a "powerful, pervasive, and
				<lb/>long-lasting” mood cannot fail to become a motivation
				<lb/>which translates into social and political reality.
				<lb/>As Z Budapest has noted, the easiest way to conquer a
				<lb/>people is through religion, because after the people in
				<lb/>ternalize the symbols of a religion, they function as their
				<lb/>own "internal policemen” and force is no longer necessary
				<lb/>to keep them in line.° The conquest of the psyche ensures

			<pb n='9'/>
			<p>
				<lb/>control of the body politic, as politicians as diverse as
				<lb/>Hitler and Mao have known well.
				<lb/>Feminist theologian Mary Daly has detailed the polit
				<lb/>ical ramifications of Father religion for women in Beyond
				<lb/>Cod the Father:
				<lb/>If God in “his" heaven is a father ruling his people, then it
				<lb/>is the "nature” of things and according to divine plan and
				<lb/>the order of the universe that society be male-dominated
				<lb/>Within this context a mystification of roles takes place: the
				<lb/>husband dominating his wite represents God “himself."
				<lb/>The images and values of a given society have been pro
				<lb/>jected into the realm of dogmas and “Articles of Faith,
				<lb/>and these in turn justify the social structures which have
				<lb/>given rise to them and which sustain their plausibility.
				<lb/>The secular philosopher Simone de Beauvoir is well
				<lb/>aware of the function of patriarchal religion as legitimater
				<lb/>of male power:
				<lb/>Man enjoys the great advantage of having a god endorse
				<lb/>the code he writes; and since man exercises a sovereign
				<lb/>authority over women it is especially fortunate that this
				<lb/>authority has been vested in him by the Supreme Being.
				<lb/>For the Jews, Mohammedans, and Christians, amongothers,
				<lb/>man is Master by divine right; the fear of God will therefore
				<lb/>repress any impulse to revolt in the downtrodden female.à
				<lb/>The political consequences of patriarchal religion were
				<lb/>evident to nineteenth-century suffragist Elizabeth Cady
				<lb/>Stanton who came to view the churches as the single most
				<lb/>potent force opposing female suffrage. Thus she brought
				<lb/>together her now famous revising committee to write The
				<lb/>Women’s Bible, an early feminist attempt to challenge
				<lb/>directly the power of patriarchal religion
				<lb/>This brief discussion of the psychological and political
				<lb/>effects of God religion puts us in an excellent position to
				<lb/>begin to understand the significance of the symbol of
				<lb/>Goddess for women. But before proceeding to that dis
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb/>cussion, let me briefly identify the sources for the sym
				<lb/>bolism of Goddess as it is reemerging in womanspirit and
				<lb/>of traditions but their attitudes toward these traditions are
				<lb/>eclectic and selective. Ancient traditions are filtered
				<lb/>through modern experience and there is no sense that
				<lb/>every aspect of ancient or culturally distant religious con
				<lb/>sciousness must be adopted as whole cloth.
				<lb/>At the simplest and most basic level, the symbol of
				<lb/>Goddess is an acknowledgment of the legitimacy of fe
				<lb/>male power as a beneficent and independent power. A
				<lb/>woman who echoes Ntosake Shange’s dramatic state
				<lb/>ment, "I found God in myself and I loved her fiercely, is
				<lb/>saying, "Female power is strong and creative.” She is say
				<lb/>ing that the divine principle, the saving and sustaining
				<lb/>power, is in herselt, that she will no longer look to men or
				<lb/>male figures as saviors. This meaning of the symbol of
				<lb/>Goddess is simple and obvious, and yet it is difficult for
				<lb/>many to comprehend. It stands in sharp contrast to the
				<lb/>paradigms of female dependence on males which have
				<lb/>been predominant in our culture. The internationally ac
				<lb/>claimed French novelist Monique Wittig captured some
				<lb/>thing of the novelty and flavor of the affirmation of fe
				<lb/>male power when she wrote in her mythic work Les
				<lb/>Cuérillères:
				<lb/>There was a time when you were not a slave, remember
				<lb/>that. You walked alone, full of laughter, you bathed bare
				<lb/>bellied. You say you have lost all recollection of it, remem
				<lb/>ber. .. you say there are no words to describe it, you say it
				<lb/>does not exist. But remember. Make an effort to remem
				<lb/>ber. Or, failing that, invent.9
				<lb/>While Wittig does not speak directly of the Goddess, she
				<lb/>nonetheless captures a sense of the mood created in
				<lb/>women who define their identities through the symbol of
				<lb/>Goddess. This mood is one of a joyous celebration of
				<lb/>female freedom and independence, as well as a fearless
			</p>
			<pb n='10'/>
			<p>
				<lb/>ale
				<lb/>point discussed more
				<lb/>affirmation of
				<lb/>body
				<lb/>fully below.
				<lb/>The affirmation of female power contained in the sym
				<lb/>bol of Goddess has both psychological and political con
				<lb/>sequences. Psychologically it means the defeat of the in
				<lb/>ternal policeman who reminds women that their power is
				<lb/>inferior and dangerous. This new mood of affirmation of
				<lb/>female power leads to new motivations; it supports and
				<lb/>undergirds women's trust in their own power and the
				<lb/>power of other women in family and society.
				<lb/>have said that the simplest meaning of the symbo
				<lb/>"Goddess" is an affirmation of the legitimacy and benef
				<lb/>icence of female power. For one raised in the West, a
				<lb/>question immediately arises, "ls the Goddess simply fe
				<lb/>male power writ large, and if so, why bother with the sym
				<lb/>bol ’Goddess’ at all? Or do you really mean to refer to a
				<lb/>Goddess ’out there' who is not reducible to a human
				<lb/>potential?” Many women have rediscovered the power of
				<lb/>Goddess in solitude as a result of their own inner quests,
				<lb/>or with other women through the women’s spirituality
				<lb/>movement; their answers to this question vary. Three
				<lb/>meanings attach to the symbol "Goddess” for these wom
				<lb/>en: (1) the Goddess as divine female, as personification
				<lb/>who can be invoked in prayer and ritual; (2) the Goddess
				<lb/>as symbol of the life, death and rebirth energy in nature
				<lb/>and culture, in personal and communal life; (3) the God
				<lb/>dess as affirmation of the legitimacy and beauty of female
				<lb/>power (made possible by the new becoming of women in
				<lb/>the women’s liberation movement). If one were to ask the
				<lb/>women who participate in the symbol of Goddess which
				<lb/>of these meanings is the "correct” one, different responses
				<lb/>would be given. Some would assert that the Goddess is
				<lb/>definitely not “out there,” that the symbol of a divinity
				<lb/>"out there” is part of the legacy of patriarchal oppression,
				<lb/>which brings with it the authoritarianism, hierarchicalism
				<lb/>and dogmatic rigidity associated with Biblical mono
				<lb/>theistic religions. They might argue that the symbol of
				<lb/>Goddess reflects the sacred power within women and
				<lb/>nature, suggesting the connectedness between women's
				<lb/>cycles of menstruation, birth and menopause and the life
				<lb/>and death cycles of the universe. Others seem quite com
				<lb/>fortable with the notion of Goddess as a divine female
				<lb/>protector and creator and would find their experience of
				<lb/>Goddess limited by the assertion that she is not also out
				<lb/>there as well as within themselves and in all natural
				<lb/>processes. When asked what the symbol of Goddess
				<lb/>meant, feminist witch Starhawk replied, "It all depends
				<lb/>on how 1 feel. When 1 feel weak, She is someone who can
				<lb/>help and protect me. When I feel strong She is the symbol
				<lb/>of my own power. At other times 1 feel her as the natural
				<lb/>energy in my body and the world."”° How are we to evalu-
				<lb/>ate such a statement? Theologians would call these the
				<lb/>words of a sloppy thinker. But my deepest intuition tells
				<lb/>me they contain a wisdom Western theological thought
				<lb/>has lost.
				<lb/>To one trained in theology these differing views of the
				<lb/>"meaning" of the symbol of Goddess sound like an incipi
				<lb/>ent Trinitarian controversy. Is there, I wonder, a way of
				<lb/>developing a theology that does not lead into dogmatic
				<lb/>controversy or require us to say definitively that one un
				<lb/>derstanding is true and the others false? Could we possibly
				<lb/>share our common relation to the symbol and make that
				<lb/>primary and yet allow our varying interpretations? The
				<lb/>diverse explications of the symbol “Goddess" suggest that
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb/>ne explica
				<lb/>the symbol has a richer significance t
				<lb/>tion can express. This phenomenological fact suggests the
				<lb/>need for an abstract theory of symbol in which the symbol
				<lb/>is viewed as the primary fact and the meanings are viewed
				<lb/>as secondary. It also suggests that a thea-logy” of the
				<lb/>Goddess would be very different from the theo-logy we
				<lb/>know in the West. But to spell out the primacy of symbol
				<lb/>in thea-logy in contrast to the primacy of explanation in
				<lb/>theo-logy would be to write another paper. Let me simply
				<lb/>state that I believe it is incumbent upon woman, who
				<lb/>have been deprived of a female religious symbol systen
				<lb/>for so long and who are therefore in an excellent position
				<lb/>to recognize the power and primacy of symbols, to devel
				<lb/>op a theory of symbol and thea-logy congruent with their
				<lb/>experience
				<lb/>A second important implication of the Goddess symbol
				<lb/>for women is the affirmation of the female body. Because
				<lb/>of women’s unique position as menstruants, birth-givers,
				<lb/>and because they have traditionally cared for the young
				<lb/>and the dying, women’s connection to the body, nature
				<lb/>and finitude has been an obvious fact. In early religious
				<lb/>consciousness birth-giving powers were celebrated and
				<lb/>women were positively valued. But as Western religions
				<lb/>entered into a state of alienation from the body, nature
				<lb/>and this world, women were denigrated because they
				<lb/>seemed more carnal, fleshy and earthy than the culture
				<lb/>creating males.12 The misogynist anti-body tradition in
				<lb/>Western thought is symbolized in the myth of Eve who is
				<lb/>traditionally viewed as a sexual temptress, the epitome of
				<lb/>women’s carnal nature. This tradition reaches its nadir in
				<lb/>the Malleus Maleficarum (The Hammer of Evil-Doing
				<lb/>Women) which states, “All witchcraft stems from carna
				<lb/>lust which in women is insatiable."1
				<lb/>The denigration of the female body is also expressed in
				<lb/>the taboos of our culture that surround menstruation and
				<lb/>childbirth. While menstruation taboos may have originat
				<lb/>ed in a perception of the awesome powers of the female
				<lb/>body,”4 they have degenerated into a simple perception
				<lb/>that something is “wrong” with female bodily functions
				<lb/>Menstruation is viewed as a curse, and women grow up
				<lb/>believing that the bloody facts of menstruation are best
				<lb/>hidden. Judy Chicago’s Menstruation Bathroom broke
				<lb/>these taboos. In a sterile white bathroom she exhibited
				<lb/>boxes of tampons and Kotex on an open shelf, while the
				<lb/>wastepaper basket overflowed with bloody tampons and
				<lb/>Kotex.15 Many women who saw the piece felt relieved to
				<lb/>have their "dirty secret” out in the open.
				<lb/>The denigration of the female body and its powers is
				<lb/>further expressed in Western culture’s attitudes toward
				<lb/>childbirth. Civing birth is treated as a disease requiring
				<lb/>hospitalization and the woman is viewed as a passive ob
				<lb/>ject, anesthetized to ensure her acquiescence to the will
				<lb/>of the doctor.16. The women’s liberation movement has
				<lb/>aided the advocates of natural childbirth and home birth
				<lb/>by emphasizing the need for women to control and take
				<lb/>pride in their bodies.
				<lb/>The symbol of Goddess aids this process of naming and
				<lb/>reclaiming the female body and its functions. In the an
				<lb/>cient world and among modern women, the Goddess sym
				<lb/>bol represents the birth, death and rebirth processes of the
				<lb/>natural and human worlds. The female body is viewed as
				<lb/>a direct expression or incarnation of waxing and waning,
				<lb/>life and death cycles in the universe because of the con
				<lb/>nection between the 28-day cycles of menstruation and
			</p>
			<pb n='11'/>
			<p>
				<lb/>the 28-day cycles of the moon. How amazing it is for
				<lb/>modern women to learn that many of the ancient Goddess
				<lb/>figures were painted with red ochre between the legs, the
				<lb/>menstrual blood out in the open, a symbol of female
				<lb/>power."7. The Goddess is often depicted in the act of giv
				<lb/>ing birth, and the birth process is viewed as a symbol of
				<lb/>the life-giving powers of the universe.18 The possibilities
				<lb/>of reclaiming the powers of the female body in Goddess
				<lb/>rituals are expressed in the summer solstice ritual created
				<lb/>by Barbry MyOwn and Hallie Mountainwing. In this ritual
				<lb/>the women simulated a birth canal through which they
				<lb/>birthed each other into their circle. They raised power by
				<lb/>placing their hands on each other’s bellies and chanting
				<lb/>together. Finally, they marked each other’s faces with rich
				<lb/>dark menstrual blood saying, “This is the blood that prom
				<lb/>ises renewal. This is the blood that promises sustenance.
				<lb/>This is the blood that promises life."19 From hidden dirty
				<lb/>secret to symbol of the life power of the Goddess, wom
				<lb/>en’s blood has come full circle. The degree to which this
				<lb/>ritual seems indelicate or shocking indicates how far
				<lb/>modern culture is from perceiving the sacrality of the
				<lb/>female body
				<lb/>The mood created by the symbol of Goddess as life
				<lb/>and birth power is one of positive, joyful affirmation of
				<lb/>the female body and its powers and processes. The mo
				<lb/>tivations are to overcome the stereotypes of menstruant
				<lb/>women as hysterical, to recognize the blood bonds shared
				<lb/>by women, to value birth as an expression of the ultimate
				<lb/>life power, to return the birth process to the hands of
				<lb/>women and to overcome the spirit/flesh dualism of West-
				<lb/>ern culture.
				<lb/>While the symbolic reclamation of the body and na
				<lb/>ture is especially important to women who have been as
				<lb/>sociated with the despised body, it also has profound sig
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb/>nificance for men and all beings. The denigration of the
				<lb/>body and the spirit/flesh, mind/body split has been in
				<lb/>jurious to men too. The denigration of the body and
				<lb/>nature has also contributed to our current ecological crisis
				<lb/>because nature has been viewed simply as material for
				<lb/>human consumption. Thus, the Goddess as symbol of the
				<lb/>revaluation of body and nature can pull together many of
				<lb/>the themes addressed separately in the human potential
				<lb/>and ecology movements. In this case the mood is one of
				<lb/>affirmation, awe and respect for the body and nature and
				<lb/>the motivation is to respect the teaching of the body and
				<lb/>the rights of all living beings
				<lb/>A third important implication of the symbol of God
				<lb/>dess for women is the positive valuation of will in a Cod
				<lb/>dess-centered framework. Here 1 am not referring to the
				<lb/>symbol of Goddess in general, but specifically to the no
				<lb/>tion of will in Goddess-centered ritual magic and spell
				<lb/>casting. The basic notion behind ritual magic and spell
				<lb/>casting is energy as power. The Goddess is a center or
				<lb/>focus of power and energy; She is the personification of
				<lb/>the energy which flows between beings in the natural and
				<lb/>human worlds. According to Starhawk, “witches conceive
				<lb/>of psychic energy as having form and substance that can
				<lb/>be perceived and directed by those with a trained aware
				<lb/>ness. The power generated within the circle is built into a
				<lb/>cone form, and at its peak is released—to the Goddess, to
				<lb/>reenergize the members of the coven, or to do a specific
				<lb/>work such as healing."20 In ritual magic, energy is direct
				<lb/>ed by will power.
				<lb/>The emphasis on the will is important for women be
				<lb/>cause women traditionally have been taught to devalue
				<lb/>their wills, to believe that they cannot achieve their will
				<lb/>through their own power and even to suspect that the as
				<lb/>sertion of will is evil. Faith Wilding's poem "Waiting
				<lb/>sums up women’s sense that their lives are defined not by
				<lb/>their own will, but by waiting for others to take the in
				<lb/>itiative.
				<lb/>Waiting for my breasts to develop
				<lb/>Waiting to wear a bra
				<lb/>Waiting to menstruate
				<lb/>Waiting for life to begin, Waiting..
				<lb/>Waiting to be somebody
				<lb/>Waiting to get married
				<lb/>Waiting for my wedding day
				<lb/>Waiting for my wedding night
				<lb/>Waiting for the end of the day
				<lb/>Waiting for sleep. Waiting... 21
				<lb/>Patriarchal religion has enforced the view that female
				<lb/>initiative and will are evil through the juxtaposition of Eve
				<lb/>and Mary. Eve caused the fall by asserting her will over
				<lb/>and against the command of God, while Mary began the
				<lb/>new age with her response to God’s initiative, “Let it be
				<lb/>done to me according to thy word” (Luke 1:38). Even for
				<lb/>men, patriarchal religions value the passive will. The
				<lb/>classical doctrines of sin and grace view sin as the prideful
				<lb/>assertion of will and grace as the obedient subordiatnion
				<lb/>of human will (female or male) to the divine initiative or
				<lb/>order. Although this view of will might be questioned
				<lb/>from a human perspective, Valerie Saiving Goldstein has
				<lb/>argued that it has particularly deleterious consequences
				<lb/>for women in Western culture. According to Goldstein,
				<lb/>secular Western culture encourages males in the assertion
			</p>
			<pb n='12'/>
			<p>
				<lb/>of will; thus in practice we may find that the male form of
				<lb/>sin is an excess of will. But since culture discourages fe
				<lb/>males in the assertion of will, the traditional doctrines of
				<lb/>sin and grace encourage women to remain in their form of
				<lb/>sin, which is self-negation or insufficient assertion of
				<lb/>will.22 One possible reason for the denigration of will in a
				<lb/>patriarchal religious framework is that both human and
				<lb/>divine will are often pictured as arbitrary, self-initiatec
				<lb/>and exercised without regard for other wills.
				<lb/>In a Goddess-centered context, in contrast, the will is
				<lb/>valued. A woman is encouraged to know her will, to be
				<lb/>lieve that her will is valid and to believe that her will can
				<lb/>be achieved in the world—three sources of strength and
				<lb/>motivation to take direct action, sources traditionally
				<lb/>denied to her in patriarchy. In a Goddess-centered frame
				<lb/>work a woman’s will is not subordinated to the Lord God
				<lb/>as King and Ruler, nor to men as His representatives. Thus
				<lb/>a woman is not reduced to waiting for and acquiescing to
				<lb/>the will of others as she is in patriarchy. But neither does
				<lb/>she adopt the egocentric form of will that pursues self
				<lb/>interest without regard for the interests of others
				<lb/>The Goddess-centered context provides a different un
				<lb/>derstanding of will than that available in the traditiona
				<lb/>patriarchal religious framework. In the Goddess frame
				<lb/>work, will can be achieved only when it is exercised in
				<lb/>harmony with the energies and wills of other beings. Wise
				<lb/>women, for example, raise a cone of healing energy at the
				<lb/>full moon or solstice when the lunar or solar energies are
				<lb/>at their high points with respect to the earth. This dis
				<lb/>cipline encourages them to recognize that not all times
				<lb/>are propitious for the achieving of every will. Similarly
				<lb/>they know that spring is a time for new beginnings in work
				<lb/>and love; summer, a time for producing external man
				<lb/>ifestations of inner potentialities; and fall or winter, times
				<lb/>for stripping down to the inner core and for extending
				<lb/>roots. Such awareness of waxing and waning processes in
				<lb/>the universe discourages the arbitrary ego-centered asser
				<lb/>tion of will, while at the same time encouraging the as
				<lb/>sertion of individual will in cooperation with natural
				<lb/>energies and the energies created by the wills of others.
				<lb/>Wise women also have a traditional belief that whatever is
				<lb/>sent out will be returned, and this reminds them to assert
				<lb/>their wills in cooperative and healing ways rather than in
				<lb/>egocentric and destructive ones. This view of will allows
				<lb/>women to begin to recognize, claim and assert their will:
				<lb/>without adopting the undesirable characteristics of the
				<lb/>patriarchal understanding and use of will. This is not,
				<lb/>however, to imply that women invariably exercise their
				<lb/>wills for good. Women have as much of a capacity for
				<lb/>positive and negative thoughts and actions as men do. All
				<lb/>1am saying is that in the Goddess-centered context, the
				<lb/>will of women is not devalued per se as it is in the Biblical
				<lb/>and theological traditions discussed above.
				<lb/>In the Goddess-centered framework the mood is one of
				<lb/>positive affirmation of personal will in the context of the
				<lb/>energies of other wills or beings. The motivation is for
				<lb/>women to know and to assert their wills in cooperation
				<lb/>with other wills and energies.
				<lb/>The fourth and final aspect of the symbol of Goddess is
				<lb/>the significance of the Goddess for a revaluation of
				<lb/>mother-daughter relations and women’s heritage. Accord
				<lb/>ing to Virginia Woolf, a sentence such as “Chloe liked
				<lb/>Olivia,” which describes a woman’s relationship to an
				<lb/>other woman, rarely occurs in stories written by men be
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb/>cause men wri
				<lb/>women only in their relationship to a
				<lb/>man (or men).23 Adrienne Rich points out that the mother
				<lb/>daughter relationship, perhaps the most important rela
				<lb/>tionship of woman to woman, a relationship "resonant
				<lb/>with charges. ..the flow of energy between two biolog
				<lb/>ically alike bodies, one of which has lain in amniotic bliss
				<lb/>inside the other, one of which has labored to give birth to
				<lb/>the other”24 is rarely celebrated in patriarchal religion anc
				<lb/>culture. Christianity celebrates the father’s relation to the
				<lb/>son and the mother’s relation to the son but the story of
				<lb/>the mother and daughter is missing.
				<lb/>In patriarchal literature and psychology, the relation
				<lb/>ship between mothers and daughters is seldom considered
				<lb/>or even mentioned. As de Beauvoir has noted, the mother
				<lb/>daughter relationship is distorted in our male-defined
				<lb/>culture because the mother (perhaps subconsciously) be
				<lb/>lieves her role is to prepare her daughter to enter into that
				<lb/>male-controlled culture in which women are viewed as
				<lb/>inferior.25 The mother socializes her daughter to become
				<lb/>subordinate to men, and if the daughter challenges patri
				<lb/>archal norms, the mother is likely to defend the patri
				<lb/>archal structures against her own daughter.
				<lb/>The bond ot woman to woman is beginning to be cele
				<lb/>brated in the new women’s culture. Holly Near has written
				<lb/>several songs that celebrate the woman bond and wom
				<lb/>en’s heritage. In one of her finest songs she writes of an
				<lb/>"old time woman” who is "waiting to die.” A young wom-
				<lb/>an feels for the life that has passed the old woman by and
				<lb/>begins to cry, but the old woman looks her in the eye and
				<lb/>says, "Ifl had not suffered, you wouldn’t be wearing those
				<lb/>jeans/ Being an old time woman ain’t as bad as it seems."2e
				<lb/>This song expresses and celebrates a bond and a heritage
				<lb/>passed down from one woman to another. In another of
				<lb/>Near’s songs, she sings of "a hiking boot mother who's
				<lb/>seeing the world/ For the first time with her own little
				<lb/>girl." In this song, the mother tells the drifter who has
				<lb/>been traveling with her to pack up and travel alone if he
				<lb/>thinks "traveling three is a drag” because “l’ve got a little
				<lb/>one who loves me as much as you need me/ And darling
				<lb/>that’s loving enough."2 This song is significant because
				<lb/>the mother places her relationship to her daughter above
				<lb/>her relationship to a man, something that is rare for wom
				<lb/>en to do in patriarchy.2
				<lb/>One of the few accounts of a relationship between
				<lb/>mother and daughter that has survived from ancient times
				<lb/>is the myth of the Goddess Demeter and her daughter
				<lb/>Persephone. This story was told, possibly enacted, in con
				<lb/>nection with the religious rites of the Thesmophoria
				<lb/>which were for women only, and the Eleusinian Mysteries
				<lb/>of Greece. In this story Persephone is abducted by the
				<lb/>God of the Underworld and forced to live in the Under
				<lb/>world as his wife. Unwilling to accept this state of affairs,
				<lb/>Mother Demeter, in her rage, withholds the rain and thus
				<lb/>prevents the growth of all food until her daughter is re
				<lb/>turned to her. What is important for women in this an
				<lb/>cient religious story is that the mother fights for her
				<lb/>daughter and for her relationship to her daughter. This is a
				<lb/>completely different view of the mother’s relationship to
				<lb/>her daughter from that which exists in a patriarchal cul
				<lb/>ture. The mood created by the story of Demeter and Per
				<lb/>sephone is one of sacred celebration of the mother
				<lb/>daughter bond and the motivation is for mothers and
				<lb/>daughters to affirm the heritage passed on from mother to
				<lb/>daughter and to reject the patriarchal pattern in which
			</p>
			<pb n='13'/>
			<p>
				<lb/>mother and daughter betray each other for the sake of
				<lb/>men.
				<lb/>The symbol of the goddess has much to offer women
				<lb/>who are struggling to be rid of the “powerful, pervasive,
				<lb/>and long-lasting moods and motivations” of the devalua
				<lb/>tion of female power, denigration of the female body, dis
				<lb/>trust of female will and denial of the mother-daughter
				<lb/>bond and women’s heritage that have been engendered
				<lb/>by patriarchal religions. As women struggle to create a
				<lb/>new culture in which women’s power, bodies, will and
				<lb/>bonds are celebrated, the symbol of the Goddess naturally
				<lb/>reemerges and speaks to the deep mind, expressing our
				<lb/>new vision of the beauty, strength and power of women.

				<lb/>Changing the Hymns to Hers
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb/>Toni Head
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb/>During the past five years of total immersion in the
				<lb/>feminist movement, I have shared with other feminists
				<lb/>the frustration of repeatedly running up against the stone
				<lb/>wall of religious dogma. This dogma functions to preserve
				<lb/>patriarchal institutions and to prevent the establishment
				<lb/>of equal rights and opportunities for women in the United
				<lb/>States and other countries throughout the world. Far from
				<lb/>becoming more tolerant as time passes, fundamentalist
				<lb/>sects are ever more rigid in their efforts to maintain the
				<lb/>subjugation of women. Ironically, religious faiths, which
				<lb/>supposedly provide the moral and ethical basis of culture,
				<lb/>are stubbornly and irrationally opposed to the develop
				<lb/>ment of a truly just, humane, equitable society.
				<lb/>My personal religious beliefs underwent a cataclysmic
				<lb/>change during adolescence, when overnight I emerged
				<lb/>from an intensely religious period into what has remained
				<lb/>a questioning, agnostic search for a satisfactory philos
				<lb/>ophy to sustain me through life. During my childhood and
				<lb/>adolescence, I deeply experienced the damage done by
				<lb/>the prevalent attitudes towards females. Perhaps for this
				<lb/>reason, 1finally found a possible answer in feminism.
				<lb/>Of all my experiences, the most fulfilling sense of unity
				<lb/>and of purpose and belief, within myself and within rela
				<lb/>tionships, has come from reading feminist literature
				<lb/>meeting, working, demonstrating, agonizing, organizing
				<lb/>and occasionally celebrating with my sisters. Neverthe
				<lb/>less, I still felt a lack, a sense of something missing. When
				<lb/>my reading progressed to a number of books, which have
				<lb/>appeared in recent years, describing the matriarchal cul
				<lb/>tures and religions that existed in prehistoric times,
				<lb/>began to understand why
				<lb/>Itried to imagine what it must have been like to live in
				<lb/>a society where people worshipped a female deity and
				<lb/>where women held positions of power and responsibility.
				<lb/>What would it feel like to pray to God the Mother? To sing
				<lb/>paeans of praise to Her glory? As l experimented, in spite
				<lb/>of my essential agnosticism, I found myself feeling a great
				<lb/>sense of peace in the mere act of praying to a loving,
				<lb/>female God. The experience was light-years away from
				<lb/>the nightmares I had suffered as a child of being con
				<lb/>signed to hell by a punitive male god. I also felt deep
				<lb/>anguish to know that such religions had existed thousands
				<lb/>of years ago, only to have been ruthlessly destroyed by
				<lb/>barbaric patriarchal invaders.
				<lb/>When I discussed these ideas with feminists from other
				<lb/>parts of the world, at the International Women’s Year
				<lb/>Tribune in Mexico City, at the International Tribunal on
				<lb/>Crimes Against Women in Brussels and with women I met
				<lb/>during other travels, they were as enthusiastic as my
				<lb/>sisters closer to home.
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb/>The IWY Florida Conference in Orlando last July pro
				<lb/>vided the stimulus to goad me into action. Mormons,
				<lb/>Baptists and various fundamentalist religious groups were
				<lb/>there in force, joined with the American Nazi Party, John
				<lb/>Birch Society and Ku Klux Klan to try to subvert the
				<lb/>conference. When they began singing hymns, I sang along
				<lb/>but with one major difference: I changed the hymns to
				<lb/>Hers. When they sang, "He’s got the whole world in his
				<lb/>hands," l happily warbled, "She’s got the whole world..
				<lb/>When the conference closed with a recitation of the
				<lb/>Lord’s Prayer, I joyfully intoned, “Our Mother who art in
				<lb/>heaven..." And when I returned home after the con
				<lb/>ference was over, I sent my granddaughter a new version
				<lb/>of Jesus Loves Me, which is:
				<lb/>Isis loves me, this I know
				<lb/>Mother God has told me so.
				<lb/>She is strong and so are we
				<lb/>Fighting for equality.
				<lb/>Yes, Isis loves me
				<lb/>Yes, Isis loves me
				<lb/>Yes, Isis loves me
				<lb/>Our Lady told me so.
				<lb/>After the Orlando conference, Becky Berg, Florida
				<lb/>State Coordinator of the National Organization for Wom
				<lb/>en, asked me to help her conduct a workshop on women
				<lb/>and religion at the Florida NOW State Conference last
				<lb/>September. In preparation for this conference I began to
				<lb/>think through some of the ideas that had been taking form
				<lb/>in my mind.
				<lb/>The sum total of my experiences led me to realize that
				<lb/>lack of faith in an organized religion had left a hole in my
				<lb/>life which no amount of rational, philosophical specula
				<lb/>tions about the meaning of it all can fill. The fact is
				<lb/>enjoy the rituals, symbols, songs, processions, ceremonies
				<lb/>—the full panoply of organized religion. I like to wear
				<lb/>clothing and jewelry that express my commitment to and
				<lb/>faith in my beliefs. I enjoy singing along with people,
				<lb/>joining hands, performing rites and acts that physically
				<lb/>demonstrate and symbolize my emotional, spiritual and
				<lb/>philosophical self—my deepest being. But I also realize
				<lb/>that I am quite incapable of participating in such rituals
				<lb/>while being totally opposed to the doctrines they rep
				<lb/>resent. There is no way I can take part in a religion that
				<lb/>preaches the subjugation of women.
				<lb/>The answer to this dilemma then became so obvious
				<lb/>that I am shocked not to have found it sooner. I believe
				<lb/>the answer is to reinstate a feminist religion that can fulfill
				<lb/>the human need for religious rituals at the same time that
				<lb/>it celebrates our feminist faith in the ultimate good of
			</p>
			<pb n='17'/>
			<p>
				<lb/>being female and invokes the Mother-God-given right of
				<lb/>every woman to enjoy full freedom and equal opportunity
				<lb/>in all aspects of life.
				<lb/>Such a religion would provide opportunities for women
				<lb/>to meet together to take part in ceremonies and to reaf
				<lb/>firm our faith in our feminist beliefs. This spiritual and
				<lb/>emotional renewal would strengthen the bonds among us.
				<lb/>Besides providing spiritual sustenance, the feminist
				<lb/>religion could be a powerful tool in our fight for equal
				<lb/>rights. In spite of the supposed Constitutional separation
				<lb/>of church and state, the fact is that our legal codes are
				<lb/>based on patriarchal religious dogmas and customs. The
				<lb/>frequency with which opponents of the Equal Rights
				<lb/>Amendment and other feminist issues quote the Bible to
				<lb/>justify their opposition is evidence enough of the use of
				<lb/>religion for political purposes. The doctrine of an or
				<lb/>ganized religion that propounds feminist values as the
				<lb/>direct reflection of Divine Intention is the ultimate answer
				<lb/>to those who argue that a male god has decreed other
				<lb/>wise. Fighting fire with fire, our rites could help us win our
				<lb/>rights.
				<lb/>The NOW conference workshop offered the opportu
				<lb/>nity to explain these feelings and experiences to other
				<lb/>women and to propose that we establish our own feminist
				<lb/>religion. I also offered a few specific suggestions that
				<lb/>seemed positive. First, that the religion be as undogmatic
				<lb/>and non-authoritarian as possible to best serve as a ve
				<lb/>hicle for expressing the thoughts, feelings, needs and
				<lb/>desires of all of us. Second, that care must be exercised to
				<lb/>avoid forming the usual hierarchy of clergy as separate
				<lb/>from congregation and to assure maximum participation
				<lb/>of everyone concerned in formulating and carrying out
				<lb/>the doctrines and rituals of a feminist religion.
				<lb/>do, however, believe that a formal women’s religious
				<lb/>organization would be economically advantageous in that
				<lb/>it would enable us to have access to the tax benefits
				<lb/>allowed to other religious groups. These benefits could
				<lb/>help to cover the cost of clinics, publications, learning
				<lb/>centers and many other aspects of the women’s move
				<lb/>ment
				<lb/>In addition to these considerations, there is one fun
				<lb/>damental principle that I feel must be basic to our religion
				<lb/>if it is to express feminist beliefs. This is the divine right of
				<lb/>every child to be born to a mother who wants it, which in
				<lb/>turn would assure every woman the right to control her
				<lb/>own body and to bear children only when and if she
				<lb/>wholeheartedly wants to do so. I feel that the act of
				<lb/>exercising this control, whether by means of birth control,
				<lb/>abortion or abstention, should be considered to be in
				<lb/>total accord with our belief in "divine intention.
				<lb/>would also like to see the physical fact of being
				<lb/>female sanctified and celebrated. Since the aura of guilt
				<lb/>and disgust surrounding female physiology promulgated
				<lb/>by a misogynistic patriarchy is so destructive and damag
				<lb/>ing to women’s emotional and physical well-being,
				<lb/>would like to see this attitude replaced by feelings of joy
				<lb/>and self-affirmation in the inherent good of being female.
				<lb/>Generally, I would like our feminist religion to be
				<lb/>positive, joyous and free of fear. Rather than teaching the
				<lb/>dogma of original sin, we could proclaim the fact of
				<lb/>original good. I would prefer a list of “Thou shalts” rather
				<lb/>than "Thou shalt nots" and a philosophy of rewards for
				<lb/>doing good rather than punishments for doing wrong.
				<lb/>would like our religion to affirm the intrinsic good of all
				<lb/>expressions of love between humans, regardless of sex or
				<lb/>of other artificial restrictions imposed by a patriarchal
				<lb/>autocracy.
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb/>Along with the suggestions that have been mentioned,
				<lb/>we would welcome a wide diversity of other ideas, ac
				<lb/>cording to people’s needs and desires. These might come
				<lb/>from Wicca, Zen or any other source that we feel has
				<lb/>something valuable to offer us.
				<lb/>In summary, I would like to mention that the enthusi
				<lb/>astic response of those who took part in the NOW work-
				<lb/>shop convinced me that many women feel the need for a
				<lb/>religion of our own and I suggest that the time is ripe for
				<lb/>establishing it now.

				<lb/>The Mother Church Inc. is legally incorporated in the
				<lb/>state of Florida. Its members are now in the process of
				<lb/>applying for tax exempt status. Toni Head writes, "Ac
				<lb/>cording to NARAL, various Dioceses and Archdioceses of
				<lb/>the Catholic Church contributed over §450,000 from Janu
				<lb/>ary 1976 to March 1977 to the National Committee for a
				<lb/>Human Life Amendment to make abortions illegal by a
				<lb/>constitutional amendment. That is only the record of
				<lb/>contributions of $500 or more. In order to protect the
				<lb/>principle of separation of church and state, I think that
				<lb/>there should be no tax exemptions for religions, but since
				<lb/>there are, it is essential that we share the advantage.

				<lb/>Contemporary Feminist Rituals

				<lb/>Kay Turner

			<p>
				<lb/>Comprend, we sweat out our rituals.
				<lb/>together. We change them, we're all
				<lb/>the time changing them! But they
				<lb/>body our sense of good! — Marge
				<lb/>Piercy, Woman at the Edge of Time
				<lb/>The body is the image relator. In ritu
				<lb/>al, we embody and activate images of
				<lb/>the archetypal, the eternal feminine,
				<lb/>the goddess. Images of power, of trans
				<lb/>formation, of harmony and of duality
				<lb/>One woman empowering another. The
				<lb/>crucial exchange of gifts. I cross the cir
				<lb/>cle to give you something; you cross
				<lb/>the circle to give her something. And so
				<lb/>on until we have all changed places.
				<lb/>Power held is powerless; power given is
				<lb/>power for all. In feminist ritual we main
				<lb/>tain a center of which we are all aware.
				<lb/>It is our collective heart which beat
				<lb/>there. We hold together, our center
				<lb/>endures. Even the most painful sep
				<lb/>aration, the dispersal which is feared
				<lb/>but necessary, cannot disconnect us
				<lb/>from that ritual circle. Once that circle
				<lb/>is created and affirmed, chaos is sub
				<lb/>dued. We survive. We thrive
				<lb/>Although some theoretical attention
				<lb/>has been given to the recent spiritual
				<lb/>awakening within the women’s move-
				<lb/>ment, very little writing has been direct
				<lb/>ed toward analysis of the use of ritual
				<lb/>by women. What do these ritual acts
				<lb/>mean to contemporary U.S. feministsi
				<lb/>And what is their significance in terms
				<lb/>of the women's movement?
				<lb/>Feminists are primarily at work re
				<lb/>vising the male-biased ideological
				<lb/>bases of culture; some are now en
				<lb/>gaged in the creation of rituals to pro
				<lb/>mote and sanction this serious turning
				<lb/>away from the old to the new. As in
				<lb/>traditional societies, feminist ritual
				<lb/>provides an emotional, descriptive,
				<lb/>intensified and sanctifying version of
				<lb/>emergent ideological systems. Femi
				<lb/>nist ritual offers an imagistic revitali
				<lb/>zation for women, participation in the
				<lb/>concrete, bodily expressive creation of
				<lb/>new images of the feminine which will
				<lb/>help alleviate the stress of a liminality.
				<lb/>The evaluation of culture by Michelle
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb/>Zimbalist Rosaldo in her theoretical
				<lb/>overview for Woman, Culture and Soci
				<lb/>ety serves as useful background mate
				<lb/>rial for answering why women have cre
				<lb/>ated rituals as an expression of the
				<lb/>need for revitalization and as an im
				<lb/>petus for political action. First, Rosaldo
				<lb/>establishes a model for interpreting the
				<lb/>difference in status between men and
				<lb/>women, a model based on extensive
				<lb/>contemporary cross-cultural analysis
				<lb/>of male/female roles and behavior
				<lb/>She states that "an asymmetry in the
				<lb/>cultural evaluations of male and fe
				<lb/>male, in the importance assigned to
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb/>women and men, appears to be uni
				<lb/>versal.”' This asymmetry is manifested
				<lb/>the fact that male, as opposed to female,
				<lb/>activities are always recognized as pre
				<lb/>dominantly important, and cultural sys
				<lb/>tems give authority and value to the roles
				<lb/>and activities of men. ...Everywhere
				<lb/>from those societies we might want to
				<lb/>call most egalitarian to those in which
				<lb/>sexual stratification is most marked,
				<lb/>men are the locus of cultural value.
				<lb/>Over the past few thousand years
				<lb/>women have not been culturally grant
				<lb/>ed a legitimate, overt way of demon
				<lb/>strating their power, their personhood.
				<lb/>Only men define, possess and confer
				<lb/>power or authority, and power is the
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb/>necessary ingredient for the creation of
				<lb/>culture. Women are therefore con
				<lb/>signed to live on the fringes of culture,
				<lb/>locked in domestic zones which are
				<lb/>rarely defined as part of the cultural
				<lb/>territory. Rosaldo elaborates this point
				<lb/>by using Mary Douglas’s notion of “the
				<lb/>anomalous."
				<lb/>Recent studies of symbolic culture have
				<lb/>suggested that whatever violates a soci
				<lb/>ety’s sense of order will be seen as threat
				<lb/>ening, nasty, disorderly, orwrong. Douglas
				<lb/>has called this sort of thing"anomalous.
				<lb/>The idea of "order" depends, logically
				<lb/>on "disorder” as its opposite, yet society
				<lb/>tries to set such things aside. Insofar
				<lb/>as men. . define the public order wom
				<lb/>en are their opposite. Where men are
				<lb/>classified in terms of ranked, institution
				<lb/>al positions, women are simply women
				<lb/>and their activities, interests and dif
				<lb/>ferences receive only idiosyncratic note.
				<lb/>Women are anomalies in most cultures
				<lb/>and have no cultural recourse for dem
				<lb/>onstrating the reality of female power
				<lb/>Female power is almost without excep
				<lb/>tion displayed covertly under the rubric
				<lb/>of influence or association with the
				<lb/>right man. But Rosaldo makes a unique
				<lb/>claim for the possible use women may
				<lb/>make of their anomalous or liminal po
				<lb/>sitions. Even though women's status is
				<lb/>lowest in those societies where there is
				<lb/>the greatest distinction between the
				<lb/>public and domestic realms and where
				<lb/>women are isolated from each other,
				<lb/>"their position is raised when they can
				<lb/>challenge those claims of male author
				<lb/>ity, either by taking on men’s roles or
				<lb/>by establishing social ties, by creating a
				<lb/>sense of rank, order, and value in a
				<lb/>world in which women prevail."* It is
				<lb/>also clear that historically women have
				<lb/>taken on very active roles in social sys
				<lb/>tems by "manipulating, elaborating, or
				<lb/>undermining” their domestic roles and
				<lb/>by stressing their differences from men.
				<lb/>In other words, by giving special atten
				<lb/>tion to their anomalous status, women
				<lb/>have been able "to take on powers
				<lb/>uniquely their own.”5 Especially per
				<lb/>tinent to our discussion, Rosaldo men
			</p>
			<pb n='21'/>
			<p>
				<lb/>tions the roles of nun, midwife, witch
				<lb/>and religious prostitute as making par
				<lb/>ticularly positive use of women's
				<lb/>"anomalous" sexuality. "These ex
				<lb/>amples suggest that the very symbolic
				<lb/>and social conceptions [the notions of
				<lb/>purity and pollution associated with
				<lb/>women) that appear to set women apart
				<lb/>and to circumscribe their activities may
				<lb/>be used by women as a basis for female
				<lb/>solidarity and worth."6
				<lb/>Of course it is most significant that
				<lb/>these roles include the classic examples
				<lb/>of women who have been allowed to
				<lb/>utilize ritual means as a source of gain
				<lb/>ing and transterring power. Men have
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb/>tenaciously held the rights to ritual
				<lb/>use since the suppression of the
				<lb/>ancient priestesses of the goddess. In
				<lb/>fact the participation in ritual by men
				<lb/>has been their most profound display
				<lb/>of cultural authority and their most
				<lb/>direct access to it. The performance
				<lb/>of ritual in most societies, "primitive'
				<lb/>and "civilized," is a simultaneous ack
				<lb/>nowledgment of men's warrant to
				<lb/>create and define culture and, by ex
				<lb/>clusion, a sign to women to keep in
				<lb/>their place, a place which we have al-
				<lb/>ready designated as outside culture
				<lb/>and without the symbolic or real attri
				<lb/>butes of power.
				<lb/>Here we see a further distinction be
				<lb/>tween the sacred and the profane
				<lb/>based on the asymmetry of male-fe
				<lb/>male relationships. Men have claimed
				<lb/>sacred space as their locus for effect
				<lb/>ing control over and/or maintaining
				<lb/>harmony with each other and the fates.
				<lb/>As Mircea Eliade has shown, sacred
				<lb/>space is "manifested space,” it is cre
				<lb/>ated as sacred by men and in most so
				<lb/>cieties women have little or no access to
				<lb/>it.” Women live in the profane world,
				<lb/>the world that is, the world that is in
				<lb/>capable of being transformed or of
				<lb/>transforming those who live in it. Of
				<lb/>course men live in the profane world
				<lb/>too (in fact we all live there most of the
				<lb/>time), but when they choose to do so
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb/>(or when the "gods" command them to
				<lb/>do so) they may enter another world, a
				<lb/>world of the sacred, and through ritual
				<lb/>practice they may take part in ordering
				<lb/>that world and themselves. The sacred
				<lb/>realm is that of being and becoming, a
				<lb/>realm saturated with power and critical
				<lb/>ly "off-limits" to the female half of the
				<lb/>human species.
				<lb/>That women in the United-States and
				<lb/>elsewhere have begun to claim sacred
				<lb/>space for themselves, to create rituals
				<lb/>which emphasize their loyalty to each
				<lb/>other and finally name the powers
				<lb/>which men have found "anomalous”
				<lb/>(i.e., nameless) is indeed an ultimate,
				<lb/>radical (proceeding from the root) affir
				<lb/>mation of the revolutionary potential
				<lb/>of the feminist movement. Ässerting
				<lb/>the right to ritual means as a source of
				<lb/>power, vision and solidarity is the sym
				<lb/>bolic corollary of equal pay, choice of
				<lb/>abortion, domestic freedom, the estab
				<lb/>lishment of women’s businesses, etc.
				<lb/>Successful and enduring change in the
				<lb/>status of women will come only through
				<lb/>the parallel transformation of symbols
				<lb/>and realities. Feminist ritual practice is
				<lb/>currently the most important model for
				<lb/>symbolic and, therefore, psychic and
				<lb/>spiritual change in women
				<lb/>Here I would like to describe briefly
				<lb/>a number of feminist rituals which
				<lb/>characterize the kind and variety of ex
				<lb/>pression this form has taken.
				<lb/>In her Spotted Bundle Enclosures
				<lb/>Jody Pinto digs out old brick wells
				<lb/>outside Philadelphia. At the bottom of
				<lb/>these wells she leaves personal and
				<lb/>found objects wrapped in animal skins.
				<lb/>Next to these bundles Pinto makes a
				<lb/>primitive fireplace with shards and
				<lb/>cooking utensils. She constructs a lad
				<lb/>der and leaves it down the side of the
				<lb/>well as an invitation for others to come
				<lb/>in. Reflecting on the creation of these
				<lb/>ritual sites and her activity in them,
				<lb/>Pinto writes, “The other day I spread
				<lb/>wings/split a man in half/spent a year in
				<lb/>the earth/excavated my own tomb
				<lb/>rolled over/cut out my heart/and ate
				<lb/>Donna Henes’s Spider Woman Series
				<lb/>involves web-building in natural and
				<lb/>urban environments. Henes defines
				<lb/>web-making as the "most basic female
				<lb/>instinct" and has made a personal ritu
				<lb/>al of web-making over the past three
				<lb/>years.
				<lb/>Margi Gumpert, a witch by trade and
				<lb/>by faith, performs a specific ritual
				<lb/>whenever she enters a public bathroom.
				<lb/>often notice that the mirror reflects an
				<lb/>image which makes me question myselt,
				<lb/>feel critical or dissatisfied with my ap
				<lb/>pearance. I don’t ignore it as trivial,
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb/>because I recognize that the mirror is
				<lb/>infested with a very common political
				<lb/>poison, virus hollywoodius or television
				<lb/>iensis, subtle pressure to measure up to a
				<lb/>pattern designed to enslave. Just to free
				<lb/>myself of that pressure isn’t a magical
				<lb/>operation. But hundreds of other women
				<lb/>will use that mirror. So after I have
				<lb/>cleared my own image of that false
				<lb/>cloud, I usually perform some sort of
				<lb/>magical activity to neutralize the poison.
				<lb/>pour suggestive energy into the mirror,
				<lb/>encouraging anyone who might look in it
				<lb/>to see herself in her true beauty. I rein
				<lb/>force the suggestion with all the power
				<lb/>of my will and call on the Goddess of
				<lb/>Beauty Herself, blessed Aphrodite, to
				<lb/>banish that which would deny Her, as
				<lb/>She exists in all of I
				<lb/>A ritual for the Autumn Equinox is
				<lb/>performed yearly by a group of women
				<lb/>living in the country near Wolf Creek,
				<lb/>Oregon
				<lb/>Let friends gather, each bringing with her
				<lb/>an article which represents a recent
				<lb/>accomplishment— some self-chosen task
				<lb/>she has completed. Let a circle form and
				<lb/>each one place her article in front of her,
				<lb/>and next to it a fruit, seed or cone. Join
				<lb/>hands and chant in unison the names of
				<lb/>all present—several times till the energy
				<lb/>is high. Then pause and chant the months
				<lb/>of the year from the Winter Solstice to
				<lb/>the Autumn Equinox.
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb/>Now let each one in turn hold her article
				<lb/>while she tells her friends of her accom
				<lb/>plishment and something she has learned
				<lb/>from it. When all have spoken all shall
				<lb/>pick up the fruit, seed or cone in front of
				<lb/>them and picture inwardly the process of
				<lb/>its change from seed to plant to flower
				<lb/>to seed.
				<lb/>Again let each woman speak in turn of
				<lb/>what her accomplishment has meant to
				<lb/>her growth and how she thinks it may be
				<lb/>useful to her self and others. At this
				<lb/>time if she feels grateful, let her give
				<lb/>thanks. If she wants to dance, let her
				<lb/>move. When all have expressed their
				<lb/>feeling, with closed eyes ask yourself
				<lb/>"What is the next stage in the process of
				<lb/>my growth?” Ask your inner self for
				<lb/>energy and guidance to continue.

				<lb/>Let all join hands, moving closer into a
				<lb/>hugging circle and repeat:
				<lb/>After the joy of harvest
				<lb/>After the work of the day
				<lb/>After the time of fulfillment
				<lb/>Comes the time of rest.
				<lb/>After the seed is planted
				<lb/>Nature takes care of the rest.1
				<lb/>On the streets of downtown Boston a
				<lb/>woman wearing a high feather head
				<lb/>dress makes a circle of cornmeal,
				<lb/>places three ears of corn in the center
				<lb/>of the circle and begins a rhythmic
				<lb/>chant naming the goddesses of the
				<lb/>Americas before the conquest (Tonant
				<lb/>zin, Chicomecoaltl, Blue Corn Girl,
				<lb/>IxChel, etc.) After the chant is finished,
				<lb/>she calls on women passing by, invites
				<lb/>them into the circle and blesses them
				<lb/>by saying in litany form an ancient Az
				<lb/>tec poem from the Poesia Nahautl:
				<lb/>Now o friends
				<lb/>Listen to the words of a dream
				<lb/>Each spring brings us new life
				<lb/>The golden corn refreshes us
				<lb/>And the pink corn makes us a necklace
				<lb/>At least this we know:
				<lb/>The hearts of our friends are true.
				<lb/>While the women alternate in speaking
				<lb/>the lines of the poem to each other,
				<lb/>they hold an ear of corn between them
				<lb/>and tear the sheaves down exposing the
				<lb/>fresh corn. This ritual has been per
				<lb/>formed from coast to coast with at
				<lb/>least 300 women receiving the blessing
				<lb/>since it was first done in 1975.12
				<lb/>In northern California several wom
				<lb/>en have constructed menstrual huts as
				<lb/>ritual retreats where they can go during
				<lb/>their monthly periods. Painting the red
				<lb/>quarter moon on their foreheads as a
				<lb/>symbol of their special condition, they
				<lb/>use the time spent in the hut for experi
				<lb/>encing and affirming the culmination
				<lb/>of cyclic process. It is a time for medi
				<lb/>tation and separation, but separation
				<lb/>without the patriarchal connotations of
				<lb/>impurity, defilement and unworthiness.
				<lb/>The menstrual flow is equated with the
				<lb/>particular power of the feminine and
				<lb/>time spent apart in the hut is for per
				<lb/>sonally determining the course of that
				<lb/>power."
				<lb/>The following ritual was recounted
				<lb/>in Sundance, a journal devoted to the
				<lb/>study and sharing of dreams.
				<lb/>In a past issue of Womanspirit there is an
				<lb/>article by Hallie Mountainwing describ
				<lb/>ing an overnight wilderness event attend
				<lb/>ed by twelve women. The purpose of
				<lb/>the venture was to share dreams, be
				<lb/>come deeper friends and explore the
				<lb/>meaning to each of them of being wom
				<lb/>en. To prepare for dreaming together,
				<lb/>the twelve women arranged their sleep
				<lb/>ing bags into a "wheel” surrounding a
				<lb/>central pole. In addition, each woman
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb/>had two strands of ribbon attached to
				<lb/>her sleeping bag which were then at
				<lb/>tached to the pole, making a "dream
				<lb/>net." The arrangement is quite similar to
				<lb/>the May Pole and Sun Dance ceremonies,
				<lb/>except, in this case, the people are lying
				<lb/>down, asleep and dreaming. As an ap
				<lb/>proximation to a contemporary experi
				<lb/>ment in revelation, a twelve-person
				<lb/>"dream wheel” inspires continued ex
				<lb/>ploration."
				<lb/>By way of contrast and comparison,
				<lb/>want to present a woman's ritual
				<lb/>which has been practiced on the
				<lb/>Yucatan Peninsula for centuries. A
				<lb/>form of this ritual is still performed
				<lb/>today but the following account was
				<lb/>recorded in 1930 by Basauri and trans
				<lb/>lated by J. Eric Thompson in his “The
				<lb/>Moon Goddess in Central America."
				<lb/>The ceremony is called “the song of
				<lb/>the roses," KAIK' MIKTE.
				<lb/>A hollow is made in a level place and
				<lb/>filled with water. This hollow should be
				<lb/>of sufficient size so that a woman may
				<lb/>take a bath in it. The woman, who hopes
				<lb/>to benefit from the ceremony is placed
				<lb/>in it completely naked. Once she is in
				<lb/>and the liquid reaches to the height of
				<lb/>her breasts, they [other women who par
				<lb/>ticipate in the ceremony) cover the sur
				<lb/>face with flowers. Several women, friends
				<lb/>of the one to be benefited, the numben
				<lb/>of which may vary, but never falls below
				<lb/>five, take hands and dance around the
				<lb/>bather, some singing and others saying a
				<lb/>prayer in Maya. The dance lasts an hour
				<lb/>and during that time the dancers take
				<lb/>flowers which they have already pre
				<lb/>pared, stoop down to moisten them in
				<lb/>the water in which the principal bathes,
				<lb/>and throw them on the breast of the
				<lb/>woman making the ceremony (la soli-
				<lb/>citante). During the dance it is the cus
				<lb/>tom to make nine turns in one direction,
				<lb/>stop a moment to moisten the flowers,
				<lb/>and then repeat the same number of
				<lb/>turns in the opposite direction. When the
				<lb/>ceremony is ended, the dancers retire,
				<lb/>the woman remains alone in the water,
				<lb/>and, on coming out, she takes a quantity
				<lb/>of it, which she carries with her to em
				<lb/>ploy in the preparation of her husband's
				<lb/>or lover's food."
				<lb/>Although the ritual is ostensibly
				<lb/>practiced to make their lovers remain
				<lb/>faithful, the beauty of the ceremony
				<lb/>lies in its kinship with all ritual acts,
				<lb/>both past and present, which describe
				<lb/>the healing, nurturing effect of tribal
				<lb/>sisterhood. The overt goal of the ritual
				<lb/>is not the only reason for performing it;
				<lb/>something significant is taking place in
				<lb/>the act of perfórmance too. An in
				<lb/>dividual woman is uplifted and sac
				<lb/>ralized by her sisters, her comadres,
				<lb/>her C-R group, her kind.
				<lb/>The above presentation of wom
				<lb/>an’s rituals is by no means exhaustive.
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb/>In fact thę range of expressive mate
				<lb/>rial in current feminist ritual sets is so
				<lb/>diverse, multivocal and widespread
				<lb/>that one of the major tasks of the his
				<lb/>torical branch of the women's move
				<lb/>ment must be to document the growth
				<lb/>of ritual events. Someone must also
				<lb/>take on the project of assembling what
				<lb/>cross-cultural historical evidence exists
				<lb/>of women’s rituals such as the KAIK
				<lb/>MIKTE
				<lb/>In “The Qualitative Leap Beyond
				<lb/>Patriarchal Religion," theologian Mary
				<lb/>Daly makes the following statement:
				<lb/>The Women’s revolution is not merely
				<lb/>about equality within a patriarchal soci
				<lb/>ety (a contradiction in terms). It is about
				<lb/>power and redefining power. Within
				<lb/>patriarchy, power is generally under
				<lb/>stood as power over people, the environ
				<lb/>ment, things. In the rising consciousness
				<lb/>of women, power is experienced as
				<lb/>power of presence to ourselves and to
				<lb/>each other, as we affirm our own being
				<lb/>against and beyond the alienated iden
				<lb/>tity bestowed upon us within the patri-
				<lb/>archy. This is experienced as power of
				<lb/>absence by those who would objectify
				<lb/>women as ’the other, as magnifying
				<lb/>mirrors.1
				<lb/>Daly’s insistence that redefinition of
				<lb/>power is a central goal of the women's
				<lb/>movement is crucial for understanding
				<lb/>the use of ritual by feminists, a sym
				<lb/>bolic model for discovering how to give
				<lb/>and get."power of presence." One
				<lb/>woman empowers another (or herself)
				<lb/>through reaffirmation of the body as an
				<lb/>instrument of communion (not aliena
				<lb/>tion).
				<lb/>None of the rituals mentioned above
				<lb/>would be considered effective if a
				<lb/>transfer of power had not resulted. Yet
				<lb/>it is of critical importance to note that
				<lb/>power is rarely considered an object of
				<lb/>possession which the group or individu
				<lb/>al may get hold of during ritual activity.
				<lb/>What is stressed through ritual is the
				<lb/>dynamic quality of power, the continu
				<lb/>al exchange of gifts which heightens
				<lb/>the affirmative identity of all who par
				<lb/>ticipate. Power emanates from within
				<lb/>as it is simultaneously received from
				<lb/>without. For women in revolution it is
				<lb/>imperative to create an entirely new
				<lb/>value system, the heart of which will be
				<lb/>a dramatic reassessment of the use of
				<lb/>power. Ritual serves as a primary way
				<lb/>of affirming commitment to that re
				<lb/>assessment. The ritual setting provides
				<lb/>a place for knowing the easy, direct
				<lb/>exchange and sharing of power. Cer
				<lb/>tainly ritual is an idealized microcos
				<lb/>mic experience, but it may be an en
				<lb/>durably important means of invoking a
				<lb/>new order of things in the macrocosm.
				<lb/>At the very least it has been a useful
			</p>
			<pb n='23'/>
			<p>
				<lb/>mode for envisioning what a different
				<lb/>world for women might feel like.
				<lb/>The word "feeling” deserves special
				<lb/>mention in connection with women's
				<lb/>rituals. In fact it is a word we must
				<lb/>never neglect in talking about any ritu
				<lb/>al. Evon Vogt once asked a ritual par
				<lb/>ticipant, "Why do you go through the
				<lb/>ceremonies? Why do you do what you
				<lb/>do?" The participant replied, “To fee
				<lb/>better, I want to make myself feel bet
				<lb/>ter."" In the context of ritual women
				<lb/>are creating a space in which to feel
				<lb/>better, to feel more, to feel the past as
				<lb/>well as the future. Perhaps most im
				<lb/>portant is the way in which ritual up-
				<lb/>holds and celebrates the validity of
				<lb/>feeling as a mode of revelation, com
				<lb/>munication and transvaluation. In
				<lb/>some of the rituals described above the
				<lb/>flow of feelings, change in feelings or
				<lb/>sharing of feelings with others is a high
				<lb/>ly desirable goal in performing the ritual.
				<lb/>In discussing the reasons underlying
				<lb/>the performance of ritual acts in the
				<lb/>feminist community, we must under
				<lb/>score the importance of ritual as a
				<lb/>formalized consecration of female
				<lb/>bonding. The ritual concretization of
				<lb/>the idea reflected in the popular fem
				<lb/>inist slogan "Sisterhood is Powerful" is
				<lb/>extremely important in demonstrating
				<lb/>the cohesiveness and commitment of
				<lb/>the feminist community. A primary
				<lb/>function of ritual is to connect the in
				<lb/>dividual with the group—dramatically,
				<lb/>indissoluably. In ritual the desire is to
				<lb/>achieve shared meanings, shared reso
				<lb/>lutions, shared emotion, not to pro
				<lb/>mote private images or dreams. The
				<lb/>specific rites which comprise many
				<lb/>feminist rituals reaffirm relationship,
				<lb/>belonging and identity. Ritual acts
				<lb/>maintain a symbolic center of which all
				<lb/>the participants are aware. This center
				<lb/>is a place to which one can return for
				<lb/>support and comfort long after the
				<lb/>ceremony has ended. A relational or
				<lb/>ideological bond cemented formally
				<lb/>through ritual procedure is nothing if
				<lb/>not enduring.
				<lb/>Being capable of membership in a
				<lb/>group and finding ways of expressing
				<lb/>that membership and acting it out are
				<lb/>necessary for the success of any polit
				<lb/>ical revolution. Let us not forget that
				<lb/>less than ten years ago Lionel Tiger told
				<lb/>us "women do not bond””? and in so
				<lb/>saying implied women are incapable
				<lb/>of creating significant political institu
				<lb/>tions. It is already evident that women
				<lb/>have effected widespread social
				<lb/>change (to enumerate the accomplish
				<lb/>ments to date would fill pages) since
				<lb/>the formal resumption of the feminist
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb/>movement in 1967. Ritual participation
				<lb/>will no doubt stimulate further and
				<lb/>deeper political change for there is, in
				<lb/>deed, a continuum between ritual and
				<lb/>everyday life for feminists. The female
				<lb/>bonds established in ritual lend in
				<lb/>centive to the female bonds that in
				<lb/>spire social change. The use of ritual
				<lb/>is significant as a source for the re
				<lb/>newal of commitment to evolving and
				<lb/>transforming society as a whole.
				<lb/>Many feminists in fact consider the
				<lb/>ritual setting and experience to serve as
				<lb/>a visionary mode. In feminist rituals
				<lb/>which utilize peyote, a good portion of
				<lb/>the night-long ceremony is given over
				<lb/>to envisioning the future of the self,
				<lb/>the group and the world. In authentic
				<lb/>ritual experience something, an ability
				<lb/>to break through the present, is avail
				<lb/>able which can lead to discovery and
				<lb/>creativity. Ritual is a potent source of
				<lb/>invention because the participants feel
				<lb/>the extreme intensity, sometimes the
				<lb/>ecstasy, of openness to possibility and
				<lb/>revelation. This sense of extreme open
				<lb/>ness and creativity is rare for women
				<lb/>who have been traditionally circum
				<lb/>scribed by severe limitation, con
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb/>strained by custom, with no hope for a
				<lb/>changed future.
				<lb/>Another important consideration is
				<lb/>the way feminist ritual purposefully im
				<lb/>parts information of a special kind,
				<lb/>information which has been unavail
				<lb/>able to women and actually suppressed
				<lb/>for hundreds of years. I refer specif
				<lb/>ically to the ritual communication of
				<lb/>feminine images, primarily the commu
				<lb/>nication of images of the goddesses
				<lb/>The suppression of the goddess in
				<lb/>our culture has meant the loss of
				<lb/>images which identify personal and
				<lb/>collective power in women. Invoca-
				<lb/>tions to the goddesses, references to
			</p>
			<pb n='24'/>
			<p>
				<lb/>their attributes, a reclamation of the
				<lb/>wealth of literature which remains to
				<lb/>describe them, the putting on of their
				<lb/>symbols—none of these ritual actions
				<lb/>indicates a desire to return to a golden
				<lb/>matriarchal age as some critics have
				<lb/>suggested. It is much more crucial for
				<lb/>feminists, for all women, to uncover
				<lb/>and recover their imagistic heritage (as
				<lb/>represented in the powers and tales of
				<lb/>the goddesses) and to create new im
				<lb/>ages which represent women's recent
				<lb/>emergence (as many women in the
				<lb/>plastic and performing arts are now
				<lb/>doing) than it is to prove the absolute
				<lb/>historical existence of a widespread
				<lb/>matriarchy. I have no doubt that some
				<lb/>matriarchies did exist. The important
				<lb/>consideration, however, is not the fact
				<lb/>that women ruled over men but that
				<lb/>they "ruled" themselves and that they
				<lb/>had culturally approved or at least
				<lb/>culturally active models for distin
				<lb/>guishing their powers from others. In
				<lb/>many ancient civilizations the fem
				<lb/>inine world was not as anomalous'
				<lb/>as it currently is. Women had access
				<lb/>to powerful images and used them to
				<lb/>order and maintain their particular
				<lb/>spheres of life.
				<lb/>One of the most important shrines
				<lb/>in the pre-Conquest Mayan world wa
				<lb/>located on Cozumel Island twenty
				<lb/>miles off the coast of the Yucatan.
				<lb/>It was dedicated to IxChel, the pre
				<lb/>eminent goddess of the moon, water,
				<lb/>childbirth, weaving and love, who was
				<lb/>equal in status to the great father god,
				<lb/>Itzamma. Her shrine was visited by
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb/>women from all over the Mayan world,
				<lb/>some traveling hundreds of miles from
				<lb/>Guatemala and El Salvador. Inside the
				<lb/>shrine a giant image of the goddess
				<lb/>served as an oracle for these women
				<lb/>pilgrims. The statue was hollowed out in
				<lb/>back; a priestess would stand in that pro
				<lb/>found cavity and impersonate the god
				<lb/>dess, become a speaking image of the
				<lb/>goddess and in fact imagine herself the
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb/>goddess. To imagine is to make an
				<lb/>image or become an image; impersona
				<lb/>tion of this sort was an achievement of
				<lb/>relation with the goddess and a means
				<lb/>of absorbing her powers. Images are
				<lb/>sources of identification; they tell us
				<lb/>who we most profoundly, most arche
				<lb/>typally are. The Mayan women who vis
				<lb/>ited the shrine at Cozumel were seek
				<lb/>ing affirmation of their own powers
				<lb/>(primarily the power to give birth, to be
				<lb/>fruitful) and they received it through
				<lb/>the pilgrimage itself (the association
				<lb/>with peers), idol worship (intense iden
				<lb/>tification with an image) through the
				<lb/>blessing bestowed by the personified
				<lb/>goddess, the priestess.
				<lb/>Much the same identification is
				<lb/>sought and achieved in feminist rituals.
				<lb/>Ritual is a special vehicle of commu
				<lb/>nication for feminists; ritual speaks a
				<lb/>visceral language of restoration of sym
				<lb/>bols and provides an opportunity to
				<lb/>utilize them personally. Sherry Ortner
				<lb/>says that "Efforts directed solely at
				<lb/>changing the social institutions cannot
				<lb/>have far-reaching effects if cultural
				<lb/>language and imagery continue to pur
				<lb/>vey a relatively devalued view of wom-
				<lb/>en."1° The imagery conveyed woman
				<lb/>to-woman in ritual experience is imagery
				<lb/>that upholds the value of women and
				<lb/>symbolizes the varied kinds of thein
				<lb/>power. If, as Vogt maintains, "Ritual
				<lb/>perpetuates knowledge essential to the
				<lb/>survival of the culture,"2° women are
				<lb/>just now learning how important it is to
				<lb/>their survival to store and transmit fem
				<lb/>inine knowledge through ritual means.
				<lb/>Much of the available data on wom
				<lb/>en's rituals reveal the prominence of
				<lb/>one individual as instigator or leader of
				<lb/>the ritual. This is not always the case as
				<lb/>many rituals are performed without a
				<lb/>leader, including rituals which follow
				<lb/>a format and are repeated the same
				<lb/>way every time, rituals which rely on
				<lb/>group spontaneity, group meditation or
				<lb/>chanting, etc. Nevertheless, a numbe
				<lb/>of women in the feminist community
				<lb/>have emerged as ritualists, the counter
				<lb/>part to the shaman in traditional soci
				<lb/>eties. Most women involved in intro
				<lb/>ducing ritual performance, however,
				<lb/>do not call themselves shamans or
				<lb/>think of themselves as such; they are
				<lb/>most widely known simply as ritualists
				<lb/>(or practitioners or witches if they ad
				<lb/>here solely to the witchcraft tradition).
				<lb/>The comparison between shamans and
				<lb/>feminist ritualists is instructive only in
				<lb/>demonstrating that their goals in per
				<lb/>formance are similar and, to a certain
				<lb/>extent, their conception of self is anal
				<lb/>ogous.
				<lb/>If the ultimate goal of ritual experi
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb/>ence is to effect transformation (i.e., to
				<lb/>change the order of things), in most
				<lb/>cases someone must prepare the group
				<lb/>to undergo change. A procedure must
				<lb/>be decided upon (in traditional soci
				<lb/>eties, custom determines procedure)
				<lb/>and followed correctly to lead the par
				<lb/>ticipants from one state of feeling to
				<lb/>another. Both the shaman and feminist
				<lb/>ritualist make preparations and later
				<lb/>facilitate the group's progress in the
				<lb/>actual ritual; both are capable of help
				<lb/>ing transformation to take place if the
				<lb/>participants will trust them. I am stress
				<lb/>ing here the fact that both shaman and
				<lb/>feminist ritualist express a powerful
				<lb/>sense of capability, that they can serve
				<lb/>as links, as surrogates, that they can
				<lb/>connect different realms of reality and
				<lb/>facilitaté change by embodying change.
				<lb/>Both roles are played by individuals
				<lb/>who have changed and are concerned
				<lb/>with enabling the change of others.
				<lb/>Eliade says of the shaman: "He is,
				<lb/>above all, a sick man who has been
				<lb/>cured, who has succeeded in curing
				<lb/>himself."2 The feminist ritualist is also
				<lb/>one who has been "sick” in the sense
				<lb/>that oppression makes one feel sick.
				<lb/>She who is now cured of the tyranny of
				<lb/>oppression offers that new sense of
				<lb/>well- being to others. A traditional
				<lb/>shaman may become a "professional
				<lb/>transformer” practicing his art as oc
				<lb/>cupation whereas a feminist ritualist
				<lb/>may rise to the occasion of transforma
				<lb/>tion only once in her lifetime (although
				<lb/>many ritualists practice somewhat reg
				<lb/>ularly). Still, the necessity of their in
				<lb/>dividual acceptance of their power to
				<lb/>change is crucial to the ultimate effect
				<lb/>of the ritual
				<lb/>An obvious similarity between the
				<lb/>traditional shaman and the feminist
				<lb/>ritualist is that both do their work
				<lb/>through performing (singing, dancing,
				<lb/>displaying, holding, hugging) and,
				<lb/>moreover, the performance is quite
				<lb/>often geared to awakening and stim
				<lb/>ulating the participant's body. For both
			</p>
			<pb n='25'/>
			<p>
				<lb/>ritualist and shaman see the body, not
				<lb/>the mind, as the locus of transforma
				<lb/>tion. The body is our first and last out
				<lb/>ward reality; it defines and conditions
				<lb/>our life experience and gives us per
				<lb/>sonal identity and continuity. Both
				<lb/>shaman and ritualist take the body to
				<lb/>be the clearest, purest expression of
				<lb/>self. And it is that aspect of self which
				<lb/>must feel change before the intellectual
				<lb/>or soul self can change. A chant l used
				<lb/>in a ritual performance called Seeing
				<lb/>the Voice expresses the bodily concerns
				<lb/>of the transformer:
				<lb/>My hands
				<lb/>Open the curtains of your being
				<lb/>Clothe you in a further nudity
				<lb/>Uncover the bodies of your body
				<lb/>My hands
				<lb/>Invent another body foryour body 22
				<lb/>The body is also recognized by both,
				<lb/>especially by the ritualist as the means
				<lb/>for making conscious interconnections
				<lb/>and unions that were unconscious or
				<lb/>suppressed. Ritual, through those who
				<lb/>perform it, creates a new body, one
				<lb/>body made of many, through which
				<lb/>can be understood and realized the
				<lb/>extremes of fear and love, the truly
				<lb/>political dimensions of humanness.
				<lb/>Finally, the relation between the
				<lb/>shaman and his participant community
				<lb/>and the parallel relation between the
				<lb/>feminist ritualist and her participant
				<lb/>community bears notation. Richard
				<lb/>Schechner maintains that “the deep
				<lb/>structure of shamanistic performance
				<lb/>is a protagonist-antagonist conflict by
				<lb/>means of which the secret wishes of the
				<lb/>community are exposed and redis
				<lb/>tributed....The Shaman is the vessel
				<lb/>through which all that is powerful
				<lb/>chooses to express itself. And these
				<lb/>powers are inherent in community
				<lb/>itself, are the community."23 Thus
				<lb/>both shaman and ritualist exist pri
				<lb/>marily within a community and the
				<lb/>powers they exemplity ultimately be
				<lb/>long not to them as individuals but to
				<lb/>the community which is the actual
				<lb/>source of their power. The work of both
				<lb/>the shaman and the ritualist is to make
				<lb/>available, clarify and intensify powers
				<lb/>that are the essence of community.
				<lb/>Transformation is useless in isolation.
				<lb/>A different comparison might be
				<lb/>drawn between the artist and the ritu
				<lb/>alist. Here two items seem important
				<lb/>(1) feminist ritual has some of its deep
				<lb/>est roots in the art of the 1960s and 70s
				<lb/>which gave rise to ritual-like forms
				<lb/>such as the happening and (2) some
				<lb/>feminist ritualists have come to ritua
				<lb/>performance as a direct result of their
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb/>previous interest in manipulating sym
				<lb/>bolic forms in other media (painting,
				<lb/>sculpture, film, etc.).
				<lb/>said earlier that a primary objective
				<lb/>of ritual is to achieve shared meanings
				<lb/>and a sense of shared goals, not to pro
				<lb/>mote private images or dreams. This is
				<lb/>the crucial difference between the rit
				<lb/>ualist and the artist. The artist takes
				<lb/>herself, her content and ability to ex
				<lb/>press that content as commendable to
				<lb/>the world of meaning and aesthetics.
				<lb/>She is a source of new meaning, novel
				<lb/>ty acting as a basis for determining ac
				<lb/>complishment. The ritualist is constant
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb/>ly at work to leave the self, to become
				<lb/>a channel for transcendent experience.
				<lb/>Gathering the group members, nourish
				<lb/>ing their need for each other and them
				<lb/>selves through the manipulation of
				<lb/>dramatic forms — these are her aims. As
				<lb/>Donna Henes once told me in a per
				<lb/>sonal communication, "Making art
				<lb/>locks me in myself, making rituals sets
				<lb/>me free. I don’t want to make art
				<lb/>anymore. The ritualist occupies a
				<lb/>unique space between individual and
				<lb/>group, between self-expression and
				<lb/>group cohesion. She is the exemplary
				<lb/>médiatrix, simultaneously the weaver
				<lb/>and the process of weaving. A quote
				<lb/>from Octavio Paz, though not written
				<lb/>with the ritualist in mind, helps to define
				<lb/>the sense she has of herself:
				<lb/>am the other when I am myself, my acts
				<lb/>are more my own when they are every-
				<lb/>body’s. Because to be myself I must be
				<lb/>other, go out of myself, seek myself
				<lb/>among others, those others who are not
				<lb/>if 1do not exist.2
				<lb/>This dynamic of self loss and group
				<lb/>gain are epitomized as the ritualist's
				<lb/>view of her role is crucial to the trans
				<lb/>fer of power which the ritual mode
				<lb/>promises. The ritualist defines her
				<lb/>sense of powerfulness by her capacity
				<lb/>to share it with others while the artist
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb/>is concerned with obtaining power
				<lb/>(through manipulation of media) and
				<lb/>maintaining it for others to observe or
				<lb/>partake of vicariously.
				<lb/>In stressing the communal nature of
				<lb/>the ritual experience, it may appear
				<lb/>that the concept of the self and its nur
				<lb/>turance are served by some means
				<lb/>other than ritual. As the examples given
				<lb/>earlier indicate, some feminist rituals
				<lb/>are performed solely for the purpose of
				<lb/>self-revelation. From its inception the
				<lb/>women’s movement has insisted on the
				<lb/>importance of realizing the way in
				<lb/>which political change comes out of re
				<lb/>interpretation and reinvention of the
				<lb/>personal dimension (the personal is
				<lb/>political). All women have suffered the
				<lb/>loss of affirmative, positive self-images
				<lb/>as a direct result of their second-class
				<lb/>status and consequent objectification
				<lb/>in the male-dominant society. It is pain
				<lb/>ful to consider the countless lives wast
				<lb/>ed, the talents atrophied and the sick
				<lb/>ness suffered by women who were
				<lb/>never allowed, least of all encouraged,
				<lb/>to know themselves and take strength
				<lb/>and happiness in that knowledge. Sure
				<lb/>ly one of the most highly regarded uses
				<lb/>of ritual in traditional societies is the
				<lb/>curing of "soul loss" of one form or an
				<lb/>other. Twentieth-century, postindustri
				<lb/>al, special-privileged American women
				<lb/>are engaged in ritual practice for much
				<lb/>the same reason, metaphorically speak
				<lb/>For women, the ritual setting is often
				<lb/>a place for naming individual powers
				<lb/>and sharing the affirmation of those
				<lb/>powers with the group or simply inter
				<lb/>nalizing them through private ritual
				<lb/>procedure. Ritual provides a mode for
				<lb/>getting in touch with the self and stay
				<lb/>ing in touch. Also, by definition, the
				<lb/>ritual space and activity are sacred in
				<lb/>the sense of representing the possibility
				<lb/>of self-transformation. Part of the
				<lb/>power and the fear experienced in ritual
				<lb/>is the realization that one may change
				<lb/>become ultimately different, as a result
				<lb/>of the experience or that the experience
				<lb/>may suddenly make recognizable
				<lb/>change that has been slowly rising from
				<lb/>the depths of personality and ideology
				<lb/>Victor Turner states that “When a ritual
				<lb/>does work...it can cause, in some
				<lb/>cases real transformations of character
				<lb/>and of social relationships."25 1 would
				<lb/>venture to say that many women have
				<lb/>been profoundly affected and, in some
				<lb/>cases, redirected through their experi
				<lb/>ence in ritual. A lost self is recovered,
				<lb/>nurtured and allowed to emerge fully
				<lb/>named.
				<lb/>Ritual facilitates transition for the
				<lb/>participant in specific ways. As Turner
			</p>
			<pb n='26'/>
			<p>
				<lb/>clearly states, "Practically all rituals of
				<lb/>any length and complexity represent a
				<lb/>passage from one position, constella
				<lb/>tion, or domain ot structure to an
				<lb/>other.”2é This passage occurs in individ
				<lb/>ual women most dramatically, and nos
				<lb/>without fear, separation anxiety and
				<lb/>trauma. Before women can enter new
				<lb/>roles they must leave old roles behind
				<lb/>roles that once provided the comforts
				<lb/>of self-definition and reality structure
				<lb/>Ritual participation can ease transition
				<lb/>by rendering it in dramatic, metaphor
				<lb/>ical terms and providing a support
				<lb/>group to encourage and enable the
				<lb/>necessary catharsis to take place
				<lb/>The transfer of values from one
				<lb/>framework to another leaves a womar
				<lb/>just as vulnerable, suspended between
				<lb/>two life styles. It is a dangerous time fos
				<lb/>the individual, one which requires the
				<lb/>support of the feminist community anc
				<lb/>the use of ritual to promote ease in the
				<lb/>transfer. Women are realizing that this
				<lb/>is a responsibility and a desire: to help
				<lb/>other women cross boundaries in thein
				<lb/>lives not as aggressive individuals,
				<lb/>proving themselves, but as new mem
				<lb/>bers of a community who deserve the
				<lb/>help and protection of those who have
				<lb/>gone before. We have all been guarded
				<lb/>and we must all become guardians. The
				<lb/>ritual setting allows women to know
				<lb/>the power of guarding and the comfort
				<lb/>of being guarded in a space that does
				<lb/>not demand immediate resolution of
				<lb/>the passage crisis. The crisis period
				<lb/>may continue through many phases of
				<lb/>recognition, adjustment and readjust
				<lb/>ment, the assimilation of which will fall
				<lb/>primarily on the individual. But the
				<lb/>community has developed ritual means
				<lb/>by which that transformation may be
				<lb/>asserted and its painful aspects some
				<lb/>what absorbed by a formal claim made
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb/>on the individual —a claim that she is
				<lb/>new, that she is one of many, that she is
				<lb/>welcome
				<lb/>For feminists, as for other practition
				<lb/>ers of ritual, doing the ritual is more im
				<lb/>portant than knowing the ritual. The
				<lb/>eficacy of ritual is always in the acting
				<lb/>of it, in becoming bodily involved with
				<lb/>the elements, not in understanding the
				<lb/>text of belief or ideology which may
				<lb/>underlie it. The essence of ritual is in
				<lb/>physical relationship, one woman to
				<lb/>another (or one woman to herself) in
				<lb/>the circle they have created for each
				<lb/>other
				<lb/>This article only begins the necessary
				<lb/>process of defining and evaluating the
				<lb/>emergence of ritual as an important
				<lb/>component of the greater liberatior
				<lb/>movement. To my knowledge, only
				<lb/>Lucy Lippard's article in Chrysalis
				<lb/>specifically deals with the meaning of
				<lb/>ritual for feminists. No other theoretica
				<lb/>material is available although move
				<lb/>ment media sources such as Woman
				<lb/>spirit, Lady-Unique-Inclination-of-the
				<lb/>Night and Quest have been document
				<lb/>ing ritual practices among women
				<lb/>since 1974. My sense of the importance
				<lb/>of ritual for the feminist community
				<lb/>comes out of an understanding of it
				<lb/>historical importance for humanity
				<lb/>Ritual marks the ultimate ideal of rela
				<lb/>tionship between self and community
				<lb/>the fusion of two distinct realities
				<lb/>rather than separation.

				<lb/>Friends of the Goddess gather round, seated in the half-lotus position or crosslegged.
				<lb/>One white feather and one black feather are crossed in the middle of the circle.
				<lb/>Proceeding to the left around the circle, each is given a black feather; the black
				<lb/>feather is held in the left hand, upward.
				<lb/>Proceeding to the right around the circle, each is given a white feather; the white

				<lb/>Maintaining this mudra of duality, the friends close their eyes in meditation and

				<lb/>The following poem is read, beginning softly almost at a whisper and increasing in
				<lb/>volume and intensity:
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb/>Oh, golden flower opened up
				<lb/>she is our mother
				<lb/>whose thighs are holy
				<lb/>whose face is a dark mask,

				<lb/>After this reading, the friends open their eyes and are given the following instructions.
				<lb/>Know this: The Goddess is Queen of Duality, the Embracer of the Two, our Lady of
				<lb/>Inversions, Skullface Who Wears a Serpent Writhing Skirt, She Who Loves Life and
				<lb/>Death Equally.
				<lb/>The white feather is death. Go out and bury it; name some portion of your death
				<lb/>(a memory, a disappointment, a regret, an ill-feeling) and send it down into the
				<lb/>ground. Point the top of the feather westward, for the West is known as the "Looks
				<lb/>Within-Place, the house of birth, the region of sanctified women” (in Frank Waters,
				<lb/>Book of the Hopi, p. 132).
				<lb/>The black feather is life. Keep it with you, body close, until the friends of the goddess
				<lb/>meet again. Then go together to a windy street corner in lower Manhattan and each
				<lb/>lay the separate feathers in a circle which will soon blow away.

				<lb/>When he saw that Amaterasu was about to
				<lb/>celebrate the feast of first-fruits, he secretly
				<lb/>voided excrement in the New Palace. Moreover,
				<lb/>when he saw that Amaterasu was in her sacred
				<lb/>weaving hall, engaged in weaving garments of the
				<lb/>gods, he flayed a piebald colt of heaven, and
				<lb/>breaking a hole in the roof-tiles of the hall, flung
				<lb/>it in. Then Amaterasu started with alarm and
				<lb/>wounded herself with the shuttle. Indignant of

				<lb/>An earth caught between layers of water waiting for the spirals to reverse. In spite of holy wet divined with

				<lb/>Temples of the Great Goddess
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb/>Mimi Lobell
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb/>The Earth has thousands of sanc
				<lb/>tuaries dedicated to the Great God
				<lb/>dess. Some are caves inhabited over
				<lb/>30,000 years ago by our Paleolithic
				<lb/>ancestors. Some are elaborate mega
				<lb/>lithic temples erected 6,000 years ago
				<lb/>at the height of Goddess-centered
				<lb/>civilization. And some are world
				<lb/>famous architectural monuments built
				<lb/>during the patriarchal age but inspired
				<lb/>by and dedicated to deities in whom
				<lb/>important vestiges of the Goddess
				<lb/>have endured
				<lb/>Originally the holiest places were
				<lb/>those that nature created—caves
				<lb/>springs, hills, groves, rivers—for the
				<lb/>Earth itself was the Goddess and her
				<lb/>sacred places were analogous to erog
				<lb/>enous zones or acupuncture points in
				<lb/>her body. Here the configuration of
				<lb/>natural forces and energy currents was
				<lb/>and is extraordinarily benevolent to
				<lb/>all life forms. Such special places,
				<lb/>revealed through dreams, alterec
				<lb/>states of consciousness and identifica
				<lb/>tion with nature, became sites for
				<lb/>healing rituals, prophecies, festivals
				<lb/>and pilgrimages. In time, villagers
				<lb/>who lived nearby constructed temples
				<lb/>to honor that female power which had
				<lb/>been channeled so generously through
				<lb/>such sites for their benefit. The tem
				<lb/>ples were not only abodes of the God
				<lb/>dess but also simulated her body or
				<lb/>womb. Her temples induced her pres
				<lb/>ence and in all probability people felt
				<lb/>that she actually directed their con
				<lb/>struction much as an artist today may
				<lb/>feel directed in the fabrication of a
				<lb/>work. Thus it may be said that the
				<lb/>temples of the Great Goddess give us
				<lb/>a record of how she manifested her
				<lb/>self. Certainly they show how she was
				<lb/>seen by people in ancient times and
				<lb/>how she evolved in different cultures.
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb/>We can think of the Goddess’s sanc
				<lb/>tuaries as weaving around the Earth a
				<lb/>network of psychic and natural forces
				<lb/>conjoined for all time at the nodes
				<lb/>where her temples were constructed.
				<lb/>Unfortunately, large sections of this
				<lb/>precious fabric have been destroyed.
				<lb/>One main way that patriarchal rulers
				<lb/>imposed their authority was by usurp
				<lb/>ing the Goddess's earthly power
				<lb/>nodes, destroying her temples and
				<lb/>erecting their own monuments. Many
				<lb/>of these late temples, dedicated to
				<lb/>patriarchal religions, still stand as
				<lb/>"navels of the world." Much research
				<lb/>and excavation must be done to un
				<lb/>earth this superimposition in order to
				<lb/>reveal the original matriarchal stra
				<lb/>tum.
				<lb/>But the temples of the Great God
				<lb/>dess are not merely historical relics.
				<lb/>Like the rituals from which they
				<lb/>evolved they are living archetypes in
				<lb/>our minds today. As models of eternal
				<lb/>structures of consciousness, they can
				<lb/>help us unravel the patriarchal overlay
				<lb/>in our own psyches that has hidden
				<lb/>our original source of wholeness and
				<lb/>power. Most exciting is that these and
				<lb/>other archetypes are spontaneously
				<lb/>reemerging in the works of contem
				<lb/>porary artists and architects and in
				<lb/>women’s visions for transforming the
				<lb/>fabric of our lives, our society and our
				<lb/>civilization.
				<lb/>It was difficult to select from the
				<lb/>thousands of Goddess temples in the
				<lb/>world only eighteen to show here,
				<lb/>but this small sample represents the
				<lb/>range of temples that were built tothe
				<lb/>Great Goddess starting with primitive
				<lb/>sanctuaries of the Earth Mother and
				<lb/>culminating in sophisticated urban
				<lb/>temples to the Queen of Heaven.

				<lb/>1. Catal Huyuk Shrine, Anatolia.
				<lb/>Ca. 5700 B.C.
				<lb/>In the compact, multileveled Neo
				<lb/>lithic town of Catal Huyuk, 40 of the
				<lb/>139 buildings excavated were shrines.
				<lb/>They were similar to the houses but
				<lb/>larger and richer in artwork. Many
				<lb/>images of the Goddess showed her
				<lb/>flanked by two leopards as if they sup
				<lb/>ported her during childbirth. In shrines
				<lb/>like the one shown here, wall reliefs
				<lb/>depicted the Goddess in a childbirth
				<lb/>posture with bulls’ heads below her
				<lb/>an archetypal representation of the
				<lb/>Goddess giving birth to the lunar bull.
				<lb/>The Goddess’s upraised arms repeat
				<lb/>the form of the bull's horns, a magical
				<lb/>gesture common to later Near Eastern
				<lb/>figures. In Egypt, the symbolic horns
				<lb/>were linked to the ever-important
				<lb/>Cow Goddess Hathor. At Catal Huyuk
				<lb/>concentric rings were drawn over the
				<lb/>womb of the birth-giving Goddess
				<lb/>suggesting a primordial origin of the
				<lb/>labyrinth. Breasts sculpted on walls
				<lb/>transformèd some shrines into sym
				<lb/>bols of the body of the Goddess.
				<lb/>Some of the breast sculptures con
				<lb/>tained vulture beaks and skulls. In
				<lb/>actual practice the bones of the dead
				<lb/>were probably picked clean by vul
				<lb/>tures before they were buried in the
				<lb/>shrines. The breasts show that this
				<lb/>process was part of the continuous
				<lb/>cycle of life, death and rebirth that
				<lb/>was the realm of the Great Goddess.

				<lb/>2. Shrine of Sabatinovka, Soviet
				<lb/>Moldavia. Ca. 4500 B.C.
				<lb/>This temple from the Neolithic
				<lb/>Cucuteni or Tripolye culture of Old
				<lb/>Europe, described in Marija Gim
				<lb/>butas's The Cods and Coddesses of
				<lb/>Old Europe, contained objects typ
				<lb/>ically symbolic of the Goddess
				<lb/>especially the Horns of Consecration
				<lb/>and the serpent. A total of thirty-two
				<lb/>clay female figurines was found
				<lb/>of them are schematically rendered
				<lb/>with fat thighs and a snake-shaped
				<lb/>head. A few were perforated through
				<lb/>the shoulders, but have no arms ex
				<lb/>cept one who holds a baby snake or
				<lb/>phallus, Gimbutas writes. In addi
				<lb/>tion, there was a large horned throne,
				<lb/>presumably for the presiding priestess,
				<lb/>and a large oven. To Gimbutas, "the
				<lb/>association of quemn and grindstone.
				<lb/>with figurines portrayed in a seated
				<lb/>position suggests magical grinding of
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb/>grain and then perhaps baking of
				<lb/>sacred bread.
				<lb/>4. Horns of Consecration, Palace of
				<lb/>Knossos. Crete. 2000-1450 B.C.
				<lb/>One of the highest civilizations of
				<lb/>the ancient world flourished on Crete
				<lb/>until about 1400 B.C. The important
				<lb/>architectural remains consist of sev
				<lb/>eral fabulous so-called palaces and
				<lb/>hundreds of tholos tombs. The pal
				<lb/>aces are free of signs of despotic
				<lb/>power, and the lack of defensive for
				<lb/>tifications in Cretan architecture in
				<lb/>dicates a lack of tyranny or military
				<lb/>tension; this was a civilization that
				<lb/>managed to achieve luxury without
				<lb/>armed might. The palaces do display
				<lb/>innovations that ensured a com
				<lb/>fortable, sensuous environment:
				<lb/>beautiful frescoes, sophisticated
				<lb/>water and drainage systems (inven
				<lb/>tions often attributed to the Romans),
				<lb/>multi-storied apartments with light
				<lb/>wells and extensive temple repos
				<lb/>itories. That Cretan civilization was
				<lb/>Goddess-centered is undisputed. Its
				<lb/>Serpent Goddesses, sacred bulls,
				<lb/>labrys’ or double axes, Horns of con
				<lb/>secration and fabled labyrinth are
				<lb/>now prime symbols of Goddess wor-
				<lb/>ship against which the artifacts of
				<lb/>other cultures are measured.
				<lb/>On Crete, the Goddess was first
				<lb/>worshipped in the huge natural caves
				<lb/>in sacred horned mountains like
				<lb/>Mount Ida, Mount Jouctas and Mount
				<lb/>Dikte. These continued to be used for
				<lb/>sacred rituals and to be frequented
				<lb/>sanctuaries even at the height of
				<lb/>Cretan civilization. In The Earth, The
				<lb/>Temple, and The Cods, architectural
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb/>h'storian Vincent Scully maintains
				<lb/>tnat not even the palaces were of
				<lb/>greatest architectural importance on
				<lb/>Crete. He believes that their siting in
				<lb/>the landscape was more important.
				<lb/>Typically each temple, here as well as
				<lb/>throughout Greece, was built in an
				<lb/>enclosed valley and aligned on a
				<lb/>north/south axis to have a view across
				<lb/>the valley of a conical hill, and be
				<lb/>yond that, to a horned or double
				<lb/>peaked mountain that contained a
				<lb/>cave sanctuary. At the Palace of
				<lb/>Knossos these features were sited/
				<lb/>sighted through the Horns of Con
				<lb/>secration. The proper siting of the
				<lb/>palace accentuated the meaning of
				<lb/>the landscape as the body of the God
				<lb/>dess. The valley was her encircling
				<lb/>arms; the conical hill, her breast or
				<lb/>nurturing function; the horned moun
				<lb/>tain, her "lap" or cleft vulva, the
				<lb/>Earth’s active power; and the cave
				<lb/>sanctuary, her birth-giving womb.

				<lb/>6. Hal Tarxien Temple, Malta,
				<lb/>approach to the Holy of Holies
				<lb/>The impressive temples on the Is
				<lb/>land of Malta are the most complex
				<lb/>structures to have survived among a
				<lb/>vast system of prehistoric megalithic
				<lb/>monuments dedicated to the Goddess
				<lb/>(see. The Realm of the Creat Coddess
				<lb/>by Sibylle von Cles-Reden and The
				<lb/>Silbury Treasure by Michael Dames).
				<lb/>The Maltese temples take the form of
				<lb/>the body of the Goddess more clearly
				<lb/>than do any other temples. Colossal
				<lb/>and diminutive statues found in the
				<lb/>temples show that the Goddess wor
				<lb/>shipped there had the same shape as
				<lb/>her temples—ample, rounded, gen
				<lb/>erous; thus entrance into any of these
				<lb/>temples was tantamount to entering
				<lb/>the Goddess for physical and spiritual
				<lb/>rebirth. The sanctuaries were con
				<lb/>structed of huge stones using methods
				<lb/>similar to those at Stonehenge. There
				<lb/>is reason to believe that there were
				<lb/>other cross-cultural influences, as the
				<lb/>ubiquitous serpentine spiral carvings
				<lb/>that dominate the entrances to the
				<lb/>Maltese temples, and which may sym
				<lb/>bolize the telluric serpent, are alsc
				<lb/>prominent in European passage graves
				<lb/>and on Neolithic pottery. Revised dat
				<lb/>ings of European and Maltese mega
				<lb/>lithic monuments based on corrected
				<lb/>radio-carbon and tree-ring chronol
				<lb/>ogies have overturned the orthodox
				<lb/>view that these monuments resulted
				<lb/>from the diffusion of "superior
				<lb/>Mesopotamian, Egyptian or Mycenae
				<lb/>an cultures, and have shown that
				<lb/>these structures preceded similar de
				<lb/>velopments in the East. The Maltese
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb/>temples, so clearly dedicated to the
				<lb/>Great Goddess, have been largely ig
				<lb/>nored and the finds distorted. As re
				<lb/>cently as November, 1977, the Great
				<lb/>Goddess of Malta was described in
				<lb/>National Ceographic simply as the
				<lb/>headless fat lady.

				<lb/>7. Stonehenge and its geospiral.
				<lb/>Begun ca. 2200 B.C.
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb/>8. Silbury Hill, England. Ca. 2700 B.C.
				<lb/>Stonehenge was the culmination of
				<lb/>a vast system of stone circles, wood
				<lb/>henges, earthworks and megalithic
				<lb/>monuments that were first built
				<lb/>around 4000 B.C. by agrarian peoples
				<lb/>in Western Europe, Iberia, Scan
				<lb/>dinavia and the British Isles. Some
				<lb/>what similar systems were eventually
				<lb/>built throughout the Mediterranean,
				<lb/>Eastern Europe, the Near East, Asia
				<lb/>Oceania and the Americas. Male
				<lb/>archaeologists were quick to assume
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb/>that all such works were the products
				<lb/>of patriarchal societies, and indeed
				<lb/>some mounds in some places en
				<lb/>tombed the remains of important
				<lb/>chieftains. Discoveries of the mathe
				<lb/>matical and astronomical significance
				<lb/>of monuments like Stonehenge rein
				<lb/>forced the idea that they were built by
				<lb/>a Sky-Father-logos-oriented priest
				<lb/>hood. But now there is mounting
				<lb/>evidence that Stonehenge and the en
				<lb/>tire megalithic system also mapped
				<lb/>the Earth’s telluric currents, named for
				<lb/>the Roman Earth Goddess Tellus. (See
				<lb/>John Michell’s books). These currents
				<lb/>are spiraling and linear configurations
				<lb/>in the Earth’s magnetic field produced
				<lb/>by terrestrial magma, subterranean
				<lb/>watercourses, the rotation and revolu
				<lb/>tion of the Earth, and the influence of
				<lb/>the sun, moon, planets and cosmic
				<lb/>particles. Agricultural communities
				<lb/>are particularly dependent upon these
				<lb/>forces since they not only determine
				<lb/>the weather but also profoundly affect
				<lb/>the fecundity of the land. Detailed
				<lb/>surveys of the telluric currents at
				<lb/>Stonehenge and other megalithic sites
				<lb/>were described by the dowser Guy
				<lb/>Underwood in The Pattern of the Past.
				<lb/>Among the currents that Underwood
				<lb/>mapped at Stonehenge was the geo
				<lb/>spiral around the altar stone that
				<lb/>delineated the magnetic field of a
				<lb/>strong subterranean spring. Such
				<lb/>"blind springs" were vital to both
				<lb/>animals and humans because they
				<lb/>had healing properties and affected
				<lb/>fertility. They are related to the sacred
				<lb/>springs of the Goddess found the
				<lb/>world over.
			</p>
			<pb n='35'/>
			<p>
				<lb/>Stonehenge was built in several
				<lb/>stages. First to be constructed was the
				<lb/>outer ring of fifty-six Aubrey holes
				<lb/>that predicted an 18.6-year cycle of
				<lb/>lunar orbits and eclipses. Correlations
				<lb/>among the moon, menstruation,
				<lb/>blood, water and tides, fertility, birth
				<lb/>and the Goddess are primordial wom
				<lb/>en’s mysteries, and it is likely that
				<lb/>Stonehenge’s Aubrey holes came out
				<lb/>of this matriarchal tradition. Their tel
				<lb/>luric significance may lie in the fact
				<lb/>that lunar eclipses cause demon
				<lb/>strable disturbances in the Earth's
				<lb/>magnetic field. Zoologists have found
				<lb/>that extreme disturbances in the
				<lb/>Earth’s field, such as the periodic re
				<lb/>versal of poles, cause the total extinc
				<lb/>tion of many small species of life. The
				<lb/>Aubrey holes may have helped to pre
				<lb/>dict such subtle organic processes of
				<lb/>life and death.
				<lb/>Women wise in the ways of Wicca
				<lb/>intuitively knew that stone circles
				<lb/>marked magic circles, that stone align
				<lb/>ments facilitated the observation of
				<lb/>the eight sabbats, and that earth
				<lb/>mounds represented the body of the
				<lb/>Great Goddess. This intuition is sup
				<lb/>ported by evidence recently published
				<lb/>(in Michael Dames’s The Silbury
				<lb/>Treasure: The Creat Coddess Redis
				<lb/>covered) that England’s Silbury Hill,
				<lb/>which stands near Stonehenge and is
				<lb/>the largest prehistoric structure in all
				<lb/>Europe, was built not as a tomb of a
				<lb/>king but as the life-giving womb and
				<lb/>all-seeing eye of the Great Goddess.
				<lb/>The practice of building or visiting
				<lb/>harvest hills to celebrate the First
				<lb/>Fruits Festival of Lammas still survives
				<lb/>today in some farming communities
				<lb/>on the British Isles.
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb/>10. Labyrinth, Notre Dame de
				<lb/>Chartres, France. Twelfth,
				<lb/>thirteenth centuries A.D.
				<lb/>The fact that Trinity Chapel is a struc
				<lb/>ture having the same plan as the mega
				<lb/>lithic monuments at Woodhenge and
				<lb/>Stonehenge, and was laid out using the
				<lb/>same design principles, lends credence
				<lb/>to the assumption that the chapel and
				<lb/>corona were raised over pagan founda
				<lb/>tions. (Lyle Borst and Barbara Borst,
				<lb/>Megalithic Software, pp. 18-19.)
				<lb/>That cathedral apses evolved from
				<lb/>the cave sanctuaries of the Goddess is
				<lb/>quite certain, but recent evidence
				<lb/>shows that many English cathedral
				<lb/>apses or "Lady Chapels” also reflect
				<lb/>the distinctive egg/womb shape of
				<lb/>henge monuments like Stonehenge
				<lb/>and Woodhenge. The Borsts’ drawing
				<lb/>shows the geometry of the henge
				<lb/>foundation at Canterbury including
				<lb/>part of the pentagram that had to be
				<lb/>constructed in order to lay out the ir
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb/>regular circles. The pentagram was
				<lb/>apparently a fundamental geometric
				<lb/>principle of megalithic architecture
				<lb/>from Malta to the British Isles, and
				<lb/>may have been a precursor of the pen
				<lb/>tagram of witchcraft.
				<lb/>According to Henry Adams in
				<lb/>Mont-Saint-Michel &amp; Chartres, the
				<lb/>great French Gothic cathedrals were
				<lb/>built during a time when the cult of
				<lb/>the Virgin Mary” was burgeoning,
				<lb/>when French queens were powerful,
				<lb/>when women participated quite fully
				<lb/>in medieval society (there are records
				<lb/>of payments to female quarry owners
				<lb/>and to women laborers who took part
				<lb/>in building the cathedrals), and when
				<lb/>European culture was being fertilized
				<lb/>by passionate pagan legends dressed
				<lb/>up as the literature of courtly love.
				<lb/>In silent testimony to their matrilineal
				<lb/>origins, nearly all French Gothic
				<lb/>cathedrals had a stone labyrinth pat
				<lb/>tern in the floors of their naves. Most
				<lb/>of the labyrinths were removed during
				<lb/>the super-rational Age of Enlighten
				<lb/>ment; however, the one at Chartres
				<lb/>has survived.
				<lb/>11. Ziggurat in the Eanna at Erech,
				<lb/>Sumer. Third millennium B.C.
				<lb/>A crumbling mound is nearly all
				<lb/>that remains of Eanna, the complex
				<lb/>temple precinct in the once great city
				<lb/>of Erech (Uruk). Eanna was the most
				<lb/>important of several sacred centers of
				<lb/>Inanna, the Sumerian Queen of Heav
				<lb/>en (Ishtar in Babylon). It was in Eanna
				<lb/>that the earliest writing was discovered
				<lb/>— records dated before 3000 B.C. kept
				<lb/>by scribe priestesses who managed the
				<lb/>extensive business and real estate
				<lb/>holdings of the temple. (see When
				<lb/>God Was A Woman by Merlin Stone).
				<lb/>writings
				<lb/>describing
				<lb/>Later
				<lb/>Inanna’s Sacred Marriage Rite (see
				<lb/>S.N. Kramer) are among the most tru
				<lb/>ly erotic poems ever written and pre
				<lb/>figure Solomon’s Song of Songs. This
			</p>
			<pb n='36'/>
			<p>
				<lb/>rite occurred at the New Year when
				<lb/>Inanna, or her priestess surrogate,
				<lb/>copulated with the king making him
				<lb/>her consort, Dumuzi, thereby bestow-
				<lb/>ing on him power to rule as king.
				<lb/>Inanna as the Queen of Heaven was
				<lb/>the supreme source of power, and her
				<lb/>union with the king took place at the
				<lb/>summit of the world mountain in the
				<lb/>temple atop the ziggurat.
				<lb/>References to Inanna's temples in
				<lb/>the story of her descent into the
				<lb/>netherworld give us another indica
				<lb/>tion of her power. When she descend
				<lb/>ed, wanting to be Queen of the “Great
				<lb/>Below" as well as Queen of the “Great
				<lb/>Above, she is described as abandon
				<lb/>ing heaven, earth and seven of her
				<lb/>major temples, and fastening the
				<lb/>seven me to her side. The me were all
				<lb/>important to Sumerians as "the divine
				<lb/>rules and regulations that keep the
				<lb/>universe operating as planned.
				<lb/>(Kramer, p. 167.) Elsewhere Inanna is
				<lb/>named as “Queen of all the me." The
				<lb/>naming of Inanna’s seven temples and
				<lb/>her mastery of the seven me suggest
				<lb/>power over the seven visible "planets
				<lb/>which were believed to regulate the
				<lb/>entire universe and course of human
				<lb/>events. This belief was the accepted
				<lb/>cosmological theory until the Renais
				<lb/>sance, and even today it figures in
				<lb/>astrology and in the yogic chakra sys
				<lb/>tem. The seven temples of Inanna
				<lb/>were probably a symbolic architec
				<lb/>tural representation on Earth of the
				<lb/>order of the Universe above. Queen
				<lb/>of Heaven Inanna was indeed!
				<lb/>12. Temple of Isis, Philae, Egypt.
				<lb/>Fourth to second centuries B.C.
				<lb/>The tiny island of Philae, near the
				<lb/>First Cataract of Aswan on the Nile,
				<lb/>was long a sanctuary for travelers;
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb/>dedicatory inscriptions on nearby
				<lb/>rocks date from as early as 2280 B.C.
				<lb/>This great center of healing was cov
				<lb/>ered with temples dedicated to var
				<lb/>ious divinities, the most important of
				<lb/>which was Isis. Nubian inscriptions
				<lb/>mention the oracles of Isis which had
				<lb/>for centuries been revealed through
				<lb/>dreams to those who slept in the great
				<lb/>rock pylon temple (see Jayne, The
				<lb/>Healing Cods of Ancient Civiliza
				<lb/>tions, pp. 30, 67). This temple was
				<lb/>said to be the most beautiful Iseum in
				<lb/>all of Egypt. Philae became the fore
				<lb/>most center of Isis worship in the
				<lb/>ancient world, and by Ptolemaic
				<lb/>times was the principal holy site of
				<lb/>Egypt.
				<lb/>The protected island was the last
				<lb/>stronghold of Goddess worship after
				<lb/>Christian Rome either sealed of
				<lb/>destroyed all the pagan temples in the
				<lb/>Empire. In the mid-fifth century A.D.
				<lb/>a local Nubian tribe still continuec
				<lb/>their ancient annual tradition of trans
				<lb/>porting the temple’s sacred image of
				<lb/>Isis by boat to the fertile hills on the
				<lb/>opposite shore where she presidec
				<lb/>over their harvest rites (see R.E. Witt,
				<lb/>Isis in the Craeco-Roman World, p.
				<lb/>62). It is no surprise then that Philae
				<lb/>continued to be a sanctuary for Nu
				<lb/>bians and desert peoples until the
				<lb/>modern reservoir created by the
				<lb/>Aswan Dam submerged the island and
				<lb/>the nearby ancestral homelands of the
				<lb/>relatively matriarchal Nubians.
				<lb/>first structure to be saved from the
				<lb/>threatening dam system was, of
				<lb/>course, Abu Simbel, the pompous
				<lb/>monument of the despotic pharaoh
				<lb/>Ramesses II, but work is now under
				<lb/>way to dismantle the Temple of Isis
				<lb/>which will be rebuilt on the island of
				<lb/>Agilkia 500 yards away.

				<lb/>14. Egyptian Drawing of the Temple
				<lb/>of Dendera as the Horns of
				<lb/>Consecration
				<lb/>The great Temple of Dendera was
				<lb/>built very late in Egyptian civilization
				<lb/>and was dedicated to Hathor. As one
				<lb/>of the most enduring of Goddesses
				<lb/>Hathor was first worshipped as the
				<lb/>lunar cow at a time in prehistory when
				<lb/>animals were revered more than hu
				<lb/>mans. The structures surrounding her
				<lb/>temple, while by no means unique to
				<lb/>Dendera, retain some undying matri
				<lb/>lineal associations. They include a
				<lb/>sacred lake, a building for divine heal
				<lb/>ing, two birth houses, two wells and a
				<lb/>small temple of Isis. By late pharaonic
				<lb/>times most large temples, whether
				<lb/>dedicated to goddesses or gods, had
				<lb/>these features and all were imbued
				<lb/>with magical, mythological and polit
				<lb/>ical significance. For instance the
				<lb/>birth houses celebrated the holy birth
				<lb/>of the pharaoh and sanctioned her or
				<lb/>his divine authority to rule. This was
				<lb/>usually shown through images of the
				<lb/>pharaoh suckling Hathor’s udders.
				<lb/>Through her milk, Hathor bestowed
				<lb/>the power and life-sustenance that
				<lb/>was the matrix of the universe. By the
				<lb/>time Dendera was built, the image of
				<lb/>the suckling king had probably been
				<lb/>subverted politically to maintain the
				<lb/>surface myth of matrilineal royal
				<lb/>descent while actually strengthening
				<lb/>the power of an evolving patriarchal
				<lb/>order.
				<lb/>The enduring testimony of Hathor’s
				<lb/>worship provides a valuable transi
				<lb/>tional record that can greatly aid at
				<lb/>tempts to restore women’s heritage.
				<lb/>For example, the drawing of the Tem
				<lb/>ple of Dendera as the Horns of Con
				<lb/>secration with Hathor ascending on
				<lb/>the horizon bathed in the solar rays
				<lb/>emanating from the Sky Goddess Nut,
				<lb/>is rich in universal Goddess imagery.
				<lb/>The Horns of Consecration recall the
			</p>
			<pb n='37'/>
			<p>
				<lb/>horns of Catal Huyuk, Sabatinovka,
				<lb/>Beycesultan, Knossos, and even of
				<lb/>Sumer where early temples are shown
				<lb/>with horns and the sacred crown con
				<lb/>sisted of tiers of horns (the tiers being
				<lb/>related to the levels of the ziggurats
				<lb/>and possibly to the yogic conception
				<lb/>of chakra-levels of consciousness).
				<lb/>Hathor’s horns may also be arche
				<lb/>typally related to Paleolithic moon/
				<lb/>menstruation/blood/bull mysteries
				<lb/>and to some of the earliest art ever
				<lb/>produced, such as that found in the
				<lb/>Hall of Bulls at Lascaux, France.
				<lb/>Of interest at Dendera are the many
				<lb/>Hathor-headed columns in the Great
				<lb/>Vestibule. There are two sets of nine
				<lb/>columns, each surmounted by four
				<lb/>Hathor-heads which face in the four
				<lb/>directions and symbolize universal
				<lb/>power. (Unfortunately every single
				<lb/>head was mutilated long ago by
				<lb/>Christian fanatics.) The famous Zodi
				<lb/>ac of Dendera and other celestial
				<lb/>maps and symbols decorated the tem
				<lb/>ple ceilings to honor Hathor as the
				<lb/>Celestial Cow. The Zodiac was com
				<lb/>plete with all the astrological signs
				<lb/>still in use today, and its precise orien
				<lb/>tation helped to date the temple be
				<lb/>cause of the axial shift occasioned by
				<lb/>the precession of the equinoxes.

				<lb/>15. Eleusis with the Plutonium,
				<lb/>Greece. First millennium B.C.
				<lb/>Eleusis was the site of the great
				<lb/>temple and altar that Demeter com
				<lb/>manded to be built to teach her rites
				<lb/>and to reveal the secrets of immor
				<lb/>tality. It was also the site where she
				<lb/>was reunited with her daughter Perse
				<lb/>phone, who had been abducted into
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb/>the underworld by Hades and who re
				<lb/>emerged through the Plutonium cave.
				<lb/>The nine day cycle of the Eleusinian
				<lb/>Mysteries, during which the myths of
				<lb/>Demeter and Persephone were prob
				<lb/>ably reenacted, was the center of
				<lb/>Greek religious life for centuries.
				<lb/>Though thousands were initiated into
				<lb/>the mysteries each year, they were
				<lb/>sworn to strictest secrecy. Even today
				<lb/>little is known about the rites. What
				<lb/>few facts have been deduced do not
				<lb/>adequatley reveal the true emotional
				<lb/>and spiritual power that made the
				<lb/>Eleusinian Mysteries so revered.
				<lb/>Though no details of the rites were
				<lb/>ever written down, there were ref
				<lb/>erences to their effects in the Homeric
				<lb/>Hymns and other writings. Various
				<lb/>scholars have speculated that the
				<lb/>Mysteries created a sense of bliss by
				<lb/>revealing the biological, agricultural
				<lb/>and spiritual continuity of life. At a
				<lb/>time when patriarchy was omnip-
				<lb/>otent, the Eleusinian Mysteries reab
				<lb/>sorbed people into the great round of
				<lb/>natural matrilineal cycles. Over the
				<lb/>centuries the temple was expanded
				<lb/>several times to accommodate elab
				<lb/>orations in the rites and the growing
				<lb/>numbers of initiates; however, like all
				<lb/>pagan sanctuaries, Eleusis was even
				<lb/>tually destroyed by Christians. Today
				<lb/>only the ruins of Demeter’s great tem
				<lb/>ple remain as one of the precious few
				<lb/>records of her Mysteries.
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb/>16. Oracle of Delphi, Greece.
				<lb/>First millennium B.C.
				<lb/>Long before the influential oracular
				<lb/>site of Delphi was seized by Apollo, it
				<lb/>was a sacred part of the body of the
				<lb/>Earth Mother Gaea. From a seismic
				<lb/>cleft in this "body of Gaea, exuded
				<lb/>intoxicating gases that induced pro
			</p>
			<pb n='38'/>
			<p>
				<lb/>phetic visions. Apollo killed the great
				<lb/>Python, protector of the site; there
				<lb/>after Pythia, the priestess who pro
				<lb/>nounced the prophecies, spoke for
				<lb/>Apollo rather than Gaea. The original
				<lb/>site now lies buried beneath Apollo’s
				<lb/>temple.
				<lb/>The theme of male gods and heroes
				<lb/>slaying serpents or dragons to gain
				<lb/>control of matriarchal realms is uni
				<lb/>versal in mythology. The serpent is
				<lb/>usually interpreted as a symbol of un
				<lb/>conscious instinctual drives that must
				<lb/>be conquered to achieve human
				<lb/>consciousness, but other interpreta
				<lb/>tions are possible. Merlin Stone
				<lb/>argues in When Cod Was a Woman
				<lb/>that the serpent may have been an aid
				<lb/>to prophecy. She cites a recent study
				<lb/>showing that people who have been
				<lb/>immunized by gradual exposure to
				<lb/>snake-bite do not die when bitten by a
				<lb/>venomous serpent, but rather experi
				<lb/>ence prophetic psychedelic visions.
				<lb/>We could conclude that the male
				<lb/>heroes were slaying the visionary fem
				<lb/>inine imagination (i.e. the Python) in
				<lb/>order to impose the rational mas
				<lb/>culine mind (i.e. Apollo).
				<lb/>Another interpretation is that the
				<lb/>serpent-slayer myth encapsulates a
				<lb/>long and bloody conflict between the
				<lb/>indigenous Aegean Stone and Bronze
				<lb/>Age matriarchal culture, which fo
				<lb/>cused on living in harmony with the
				<lb/>Earth’s telluric currents (symbolized
				<lb/>by the serpent), and the invading
				<lb/>patriarchal Indo-European culture,
				<lb/>which virtually worshipped metal
				<lb/>(symbolized by the serpent-slayer).
				<lb/>The Indo-Europeans were crude iron
				<lb/>workers and warriors. They wor
				<lb/>shipped a god of volcanic mountains,
				<lb/>and their most esteemed citizen was
				<lb/>the blacksmith. Horse-drawn chariots
				<lb/>and iron weapons made them for
				<lb/>midable conquerors, and wherever
				<lb/>they went, from Europe to India, their
				<lb/>assimilation marked the beginning of
				<lb/>the Iron Age. According to dowsers,
				<lb/>ferrous metals nullify all sensitivity to
				<lb/>the telluric currents. The serpent
				<lb/>slayer myth, then, could be a vivid
				<lb/>image of the destruction of the whole
				<lb/>matriarchal way of life. It encodes the
				<lb/>earliest instances of the contempt for
				<lb/>nature that has become so much a
				<lb/>part of the patriarchy’s technological
				<lb/>imperative— and such an anathema to
				<lb/>the female soul.
				<lb/>17. The Parthenon, reconstruction
				<lb/>of Athene’s Statue, Greece.
				<lb/>447-432 B.C.
				<lb/>The Parthenon is the most celebrat
				<lb/>ed Goddess temple in the world. Jewel
				<lb/>of the Acropolis, it epitomized the
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb/>glory of Athens, Athene’s city, and the
				<lb/>whole of the classical world. For 2500
				<lb/>years it has remained the architectural
				<lb/>ideal of Western civilization. The Par
				<lb/>thenon was named for and dedicated
				<lb/>to Athene Parthenos. Parthenos,
				<lb/>meaning "virgin” as in parthenogen
				<lb/>esis, “virgin birth"), traditionally did
				<lb/>not mean "celibate” but rather, un
				<lb/>married, complete-in-herself, self
				<lb/>creating. A virgin gave birth to her
				<lb/>self, not babies, and to culture. Plato
				<lb/>alluded to this when he said that those
				<lb/>who are pregnant in the body give
				<lb/>birth to children; those who are preg
				<lb/>nant in the soul give birth to culture.
				<lb/>Because Athene had always been a
				<lb/>virgin culture-bearer as opposed to a
				<lb/>wifely child-bearer, the Indo-Europe
				<lb/>ans could not convincingly domes
				<lb/>ticate her, as they had the other god
				<lb/>desses, by marrying her to Zeus. Final
				<lb/>ly, through the ingenious contrivance
				<lb/>of making her Zeus’s daughter, born
				<lb/>from his head, they corrupted her to
				<lb/>serve their ends. She was turned into a
				<lb/>Goddess of War who sanctioned
				<lb/>bloody battles against even her own
				<lb/>sisters, the Amazons. She was por
				<lb/>trayed aiding all the heroes as they
				<lb/>slew the serpents, Gorgons and other
				<lb/>symbols of matriarchal order. Her
				<lb/>temple was absolutely devoid of
				<lb/>traditional Goddess imagery. Beauti
				<lb/>ful as it was, it had no caves, apses,
				<lb/>egg/wombs, or Horns of Consecration
				<lb/>—only rational mathematical pro
				<lb/>portions
				<lb/>A monumental statue of Athene
				<lb/>that has not survived dominated the
				<lb/>Parthenon. However, conjectural re
				<lb/>constructions of it show Athene with
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb/>the Gorgon’s head around her neck
				<lb/>like a trophy or psychological shadow.
				<lb/>Her great serpent, warrior's shield and
				<lb/>spear are at her side as references to
				<lb/>both the telluric serpent and lron Age
				<lb/>weapons, and in her hand she holds a
				<lb/>crystal ball. Her image could rep
				<lb/>resent either a true matriarchal God
				<lb/>dess or an anima figure—the symbol
				<lb/>of feminine consciousness as experi
				<lb/>enced by men. (This revised Athene
				<lb/>was, after all, born from Zeus’s head).
				<lb/>As overseer of the dominating tel
				<lb/>luric serpents and wearer of the Cor
				<lb/>gon’s head, Athene appears to repre
				<lb/>sent the spiritualization of telluric
				<lb/>or Kundalini energy. Kundalini sym
				<lb/>bolizes in Hindu philosophy the
				<lb/>serpent-energy of the Goddess who,
				<lb/>through a series of yogic exercises, is
				<lb/>made to ascend the spinal column to
				<lb/>elicit pure consciousness. The West
				<lb/>ern counterpart is the psychoanalyti
				<lb/>cal channeling of the contents of the
				<lb/>unconscious into consciousness to
				<lb/>achieve self-knowledge. As the self
				<lb/>creating Goddess of Wisdom, Athene
				<lb/>seems to combine the two traditions.
				<lb/>Pure consciousness (wisdom, self
				<lb/>knowledge) is symbolized in Tibetan
				<lb/>Buddhism by the “Jewel Ornament of
				<lb/>the Liberation” and in Chinese art by a
				<lb/>crystal in the claw of the telluric
				<lb/>dragon. Was it symbolized in classical
				<lb/>Greece by the crystal in Athene's
				<lb/>hand? And is the Parthenon’s pristine
				<lb/>geometry a monument to the minds
				<lb/>of the men who sapped Athene's
				<lb/>power or is it a monument to a form
				<lb/>of pure consciousness inherent in the
				<lb/>Great Goddess?
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb/>18. Ise Shrine, Japan.
				<lb/>685 A.D. or earlier
				<lb/>As the national shrine of Shintoism,
				<lb/>Ise is the most beloved sanctuary in
				<lb/>Japan. Far from being a monumental
				<lb/>stone structure, it is a simple, tiny
			</p>
			<pb n='39'/>
			<p>
				<lb/>group of buildings made of wood and
				<lb/>thatch. Strongly centered in Goddess
				<lb/>worship, Shintoism remains one of the
				<lb/>few nature-based religions in the
				<lb/>world today. The need to renew Ise's
				<lb/>nature spirits, as well as to preserve its
				<lb/>material structure, has resulted in one
				<lb/>of the most telling examples in the
				<lb/>history of architecture of human ded
				<lb/>ication to a shrine. Every twenty
				<lb/>years, from 685 A.D. to today, Ise has
				<lb/>been painstakingly dismantled and re
				<lb/>built on alternating sites. The recon
				<lb/>struction is so exact that the history of
				<lb/>Japanese religions from prehistoric to
				<lb/>modern times can be read in the struc
				<lb/>tures. Through studying Ise and the
				<lb/>rituals performed there now, scholars
				<lb/>have been able to reconstruct the
				<lb/>original rite. It consisted of “a priest
				<lb/>ess, worshipping beside a sacred
				<lb/>planted bough, which received the
				<lb/>guardian deity when she descended
				<lb/>from heaven. Sanctified at Ise are a
				<lb/>hill, a bush, water and stones, a
				<lb/>sacred mirror, [and) the sacred pillar,
				<lb/>which is half-buried beneath the floor
				<lb/>of the shrine.” (Masuda, p. 16)
				<lb/>The whole archetypal matriarchal
				<lb/>cycle from prehistory's Goddess of
				<lb/>Fertility to civilization's Queen of
				<lb/>Heaven, as well as the history of
				<lb/>Japanese religion, is compressed into
				<lb/>the two modest shrines at Ise. The
				<lb/>outer shrine, called the Gegü, is dedi
				<lb/>cated to Toyukehime, the Goddess of
				<lb/>Fertility and Grain—the primeval
				<lb/>Earth Mother. The inner shrine, called
				<lb/>the Naigü, is dedicated to Amaterasu,
				<lb/>the Sun Goddess who today em
				<lb/>blazons the Japanese flag and from
				<lb/>whom all Japanese emperors claimed
				<lb/>descent.

				<lb/>Woman’s Primacy in the Coming Reformation
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb/>Grace Shinell
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb/>Spirit is energy; frequency is form. The spirit, the energy,
				<lb/>the frequency, the form of women is different from the form
				<lb/>of men. Nevertheless, there is a growing effort to equate
				<lb/>female with male; the effort is on the part of men. Male ex
				<lb/>perts who have always detrimentally defined women are
				<lb/>now encouraging women to accept equality. Women must
				<lb/>suspect this sudden offering of brotherhood and they must
				<lb/>suspect its profferers of either ignorance or witting despera
				<lb/>tion. Let us examine the proposition of opposite but equal
				<lb/>and immediately dispose of it as a factual concept
				<lb/>...Research has led to the startling conclusion that "na
				<lb/>ture’s first choice or primal impulse is to (produce) a female."
				<lb/>Genetically speaking, the beginning of everyone’s life is
				<lb/>female! Only when a new substance, the male hormone, is
				<lb/>added to the fetus does its gender change. Sheila D. Collins'
				<lb/>The female of the species is not the opposite of the male,
				<lb/>rather she contains the male form, among other possible
				<lb/>variations. The female is the matrix from which all mutation
				<lb/>occurs. Biologically males are mutants.? Their ovaries have
				<lb/>been electrochemically transmutedintotestes, theirclitorises
				<lb/>into penises, whereas their mammaries and uteruses remain
				<lb/>as vestiges of their undeveloped female form. Moreover
				<lb/>the center of gravity in the male physique resides in the
				<lb/>shoulders, whereas a woman’s center of gravity is in her solar
				<lb/>plexus. From a spiritual standpoint this physical difference
				<lb/>is highly significant, for the correct practice of yoga re
				<lb/>quires that the center of gravity be in the solar plexus, which
				<lb/>suggests that the entire practice of yoga was developed by
				<lb/>and for women. As stated, hormonal variation is the electro
				<lb/>chemical basis for the physical difference between men and
				<lb/>women, but the difference in form should be understood as
				<lb/>one of frequency as well.
				<lb/>... Einstein and other well-known physicists have noted the
				<lb/>fact that matter is thought, vibrating at a lower frequen
				<lb/>cy. ...In fact all manifestation is merely the life force work
				<lb/>ing at differing rates of vibration and the difference be
				<lb/>tween one element and another is merely its different fre
				<lb/>quency of vibration. Peter Rendels
				<lb/>Because frequency is form, manifestation fluctuates. Ex
				<lb/>treme fluctuations are noted as cyclical occurrences. Any
				<lb/>perception of circuitry is an improvement over the tradition
				<lb/>al linear world view that men have long held. Nevertheless,
				<lb/>cyclical observation is still literally short-sighted, for energy
				<lb/>spirals, which occasions its fluctuations, e.g., sine waves.
				<lb/>More precisely, electromagnetic currents make a double
				<lb/>helical circuit of expansion and contraction. Envision a fig
				<lb/>ure 8. However, only female frequency travels on a double
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb/>helical circuit; this actually can be perceived in the form of
				<lb/>the female sex chromosome (X). The form of the male sex
				<lb/>chromosome, as everyone knows, is Y. Male energy is short
				<lb/>circuited.
				<lb/>Nowhere is the short-circuiting of the male more obvious
				<lb/>than in the sex act. For this reason men who would attain spir
				<lb/>ituality are advised to practice celibacy. Thus male religions
				<lb/>have traditionally proscribed the rising snake of sexual ener
				<lb/>gy (except in Kundalini, a practice that forces the semen
				<lb/>back up the spinal column).“ The ancient female-principled
				<lb/>religions did not proscribe their aspirants' life-giving ca
				<lb/>pabilities.
				<lb/>...As in the procreation of children so in the origin of all
				<lb/>things, it was the self-fertilizing female principle that was
				<lb/>the operative cause in fecundity. ..E. O. James“
				<lb/>Male religions have coopted the female principality in
				<lb/>many ways. For example, Yin and Yang are recent male in
				<lb/>ventions intended to give men a place in spiritual life, just
				<lb/>as the acknowledgment of sexual reproduction gave them a
				<lb/>role in family life. The comparison is revealing for, although
				<lb/>concepts such as Yin and Yang appear to posit equality,
				<lb/>men have taken for themselves superior spiritual roles, just
				<lb/>as they have claimed supreme authority in the family, even
				<lb/>though their role in reproduction is clearly secondary.
				<lb/>The allocation of Yin, or passivity, to women is merely
				<lb/>the most obvious part of the ruse. As every woman with a
				<lb/>raised consciousness knows, women need not choose be
				<lb/>tween activity and passivity. Women are capable of being
				<lb/>both active and passive. It may even be said that in this re
				<lb/>spect women are balanced, whereas men are imbalanced—
				<lb/>overly "active.
				<lb/>More important, the algebraic X signifies the unknown
				<lb/>and is also the Greek letter psi as in psychic. X represents
				<lb/>negative energy, the energy that dissolves the material world
				<lb/>as in the X-ray process. Women (XX) actually transmit more
				<lb/>negative (dematerializing), so-called passive energy than
				<lb/>men (XY) do and can thus experience states of passivity (spir
				<lb/>ituality) that men cannot. Once again, that which is a fe
				<lb/>male advantage has been declared a disadvantage.
				<lb/>Originally the Yin-Yang symbol represented this essentia
				<lb/>eveness or Eve-ness. To perceive this inner meaning, one
				<lb/>need only look deeply. Then the Yin-Yang symbol is revealed
				<lb/>as a composite picture of the whole (XX), for the one-dimen
				<lb/>sional symbol () is a cross-section of interlocked helixes
				<lb/>(Such cross-sections are myopically misinterpreted by scien
				<lb/>tists as waves.) Symbols are contracted and powerful truths.
				<lb/>But the truly powerful symbols are few and they have been
				<lb/>coopted and misapplied. Properly used, however, symbols
				<lb/>do facilitate communication.

				<lb/>Homer would not have sung so sweetly (and truthfully) had
				<lb/>she not composed in hexameter.
				<lb/>Another symbol that is part of woman’s original symbolic
				<lb/>logic is the hexagram, the six-pointed star, the Seal of Sol
				<lb/>omon, which is also the Kabbalistic Tree of Life. Again this
				<lb/>symbol represents the self-fertilizing female principle. The
				<lb/>six pointed star is actually two equilateral triangles
				<lb/>the apexes of which have equally fused. The fusing is on a
				<lb/>one-to-one ratio, which is duplication —exact reproduction
				<lb/>-parthenogenesis. In actuality birth is reduction-division;
				<lb/>so is death. Physically and spiritually, the one becomes dip
				<lb/>loid, which becomes haploid; embryologists call this process
				<lb/>meiosis-mitosis. Thus all multiplicity is duplicity but per
				<lb/>haps only women, so often accused of it, can understand
				<lb/>duplicity
				<lb/>This symbol XX with its chain of double helical "ov
				<lb/>aries” (which phallicized is also the symbol for atomic en
				<lb/>ergy
				<lb/>X), might as easily have been discovered as the
				<lb/>model for the molecular structure of DNA, deoxyribonucleic
				<lb/>acid, the carrier of genetic code. But Rosalind Franklin, the
				<lb/>actual discoverer of what was actually discovered, was too
				<lb/>expert a photographer to have gotten her Star of David pen
				<lb/>dant in front of the lens when she took the now-famous crys
				<lb/>talograph that clearly revealed the double helical structure
				<lb/>of DNA
				<lb/>Telling scientists anything may be like jumping out of the
				<lb/>frying pan into the fire (or we might more accurately say
				<lb/>from the pedestal onto the pyre—women were pushed, they
				<lb/>didn’t fall), but knowledge, like all energy, is not contain
				<lb/>able. The five-pointed star—the Kabbalistic sacred penta
				<lb/>gram—the Wiccan Star of Transformation—is a perfect
				<lb/>model of mutation, which is the result of sexual genesis.
				<lb/>Sexual mutation may be compared to atomic combustion
				<lb/>for which the pentagram could as well be the symbol but,
				<lb/>no doubt, someone in the Pentagon already knows this. Per
				<lb/>haps the general public should also be apprised that, upend
				<lb/>ed,  the five pointed star represents the horned god of
				<lb/>Wicca. Ironically, nefas (the unlawful) has become fas (law
				<lb/>ful).
				<lb/>Symbols are, of course, picture stories. The five pointed
				<lb/>star, the symbol of the Christian era,? is a tragic picture story
				<lb/>of disordered polarity. The hexagram is all balance and har
				<lb/>mony, which is why people throw the I Ching with its 64 hex
				<lb/>agrams” (8 x 8, the number of greatest duplication squared,
				<lb/>contains all possibilities)— much as witches cast hexes.
				<lb/>The pentagram and hexagram are visibly fused triangles.
				<lb/>The triangle or number three represents the "final step
				<lb/>towards mastering the universal knowledge of the spiritual
				<lb/>I The number 3 is a female number; in the Tarot
				<lb/>cards, it is the Empress, and as R. Allendy points out, “Three
				<lb/>definitely is the dynamic principle itself."” Pyramid energy
				<lb/>is just becoming reunderstood.
				<lb/>... Through the use of radiesthesia, or dowsing rods, re
				<lb/>searchers have been able to show that there is an helical vor
				<lb/>tex of energy emanating from the apex of the pyramid which
				<lb/>actually expands in diameter as it rises higher and higher.
				<lb/>Max Toth, Greg Nielsen"
				<lb/>This means that above the static energy or manifestation
				<lb/>of every physical pyramid is an unseen pyramid of dynamic
				<lb/>energy—spirit. (Dynamic instead of passive and static in
				<lb/>stead of active are better definitions for Yin and Yang or
				<lb/>Sakti and Shiva, especially if one is to understand the roles
				<lb/>attributed to the latter.) The static and dynamic pyramids,
				<lb/>one physical, one spirit, mirror each other. They are, apex
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb/>to apex, double helical (8). They are an obvious funnel
				<lb/>arrangement. Funeling energy or matter is contracted at
				<lb/>the apex, expanded at the base. Contraction is some
				<lb/>times called centripetal force; expansion, centrifugal force.
				<lb/>These spiraling forces are basic to the creation of life.
				<lb/>...In the heart, the two interlocked gyres become the Seal
				<lb/>of Solomon or six pointed star, which in the Hindu tradition
				<lb/>is the symbol of the heart chakra itself. )ill Purcel
				<lb/>The sign of the human heart is the design of the human
				<lb/>heart and it is a funneling system that generates centripetal
				<lb/>centrifugal pulsing. The expansions and contractions of
				<lb/>breathing set the funneling system in motion physically but,
				<lb/>spiritually, exhaling is aspiration, inhaling is inspiration. This
				<lb/>contracting-expanding, pulsing, breathing is literally uni
				<lb/>versal. We reincarnate in the same way that we heartbeat
				<lb/>to-heartbeat, breath-to-breath incarnate a carnal body.
				<lb/>What we aspire to we become by being inspired." Thus
				<lb/>yogis change their breathing patterns to attain a variety of
				<lb/>spiritual transformations.
				<lb/>In Islam the breath is the "divine exhalation,” the manifesta
				<lb/>tion of the creative, the feminine principle of the one, anal
				<lb/>ogous with the Hindu goddess Sakti... according to the
				<lb/>Sufi mystic Ibn ’Arabi, her (the moon’s) twenty-eight phases
				<lb/>correspond to the letters of the Arabic alphabet, the forms
				<lb/>of which are themselves traditionally derived from the lunar
				<lb/>shapes. Moreover, since the letters are also phonetic, their
				<lb/>flow, sound and inner meaning as divine names (or lines of
				<lb/>force, or causes of the universe) are closely related. Jill
				<lb/>Purcels

				<lb/>Consider the divine exhalation of the words: spire, spiral,
				<lb/>spiritual, respire, aspire, inspire, expire. SSS is the exhalation
				<lb/>of breath. It is also the hissing sound of snakes and, as fre
				<lb/>quency is form S is the shape of the only earthly creature
				<lb/>that spirals. The connections between snakes and women
				<lb/>are well established but the snake is often misperceived as a
				<lb/>phallic symbol. More appropriately and traditionally, the
				<lb/>snake represents the spiraling creative force, S, and coupling
				<lb/>snakes represent the double spiral, 8, the form of the female
				<lb/>sex chromosome. Significantly, even modern, patriarchal
				<lb/>Hinduism acknowledges this traditional association by
				<lb/>designating the all-creative Kundalini energy as female and
				<lb/>symbolizing it as a coiled serpent." Most other religions
				<lb/>have interpreted the sacred connection between women
				<lb/>and snakes deviously.
				<lb/>Now the serpent was more subtil than any beast of the field
				<lb/>which the Lord God had made. And he said unto the woman,
				<lb/>"Ye, hath heard what God said, ’Ye shall not eat of the tree
				<lb/>of Knowledge."
				<lb/>This quotation from the Book of Genesis is an interesting
				<lb/>example of a trend that has been noted by the Classics scholar
				<lb/>John Pinsent:
				<lb/>One final parallel exists between the Greek cosmological
				<lb/>myths and those of the near east. [The Judaic Christian Gen
				<lb/>esis) This is the need for the newly triumphant God [Zeus or
				<lb/>Jehoval to defend his position first against gods and then
				<lb/>against monsters sent up against him by Earth.
				<lb/>Overwhelmingly the "monsters" that threaten Greek
				<lb/>gods are snakelike:
				<lb/>Hera sentsnakes tostrangle Heracles when hewas ababy.
				<lb/>Heracles wrestled with Triton, a sea dragon.
				<lb/>Heracles killed Hydra, a serpentwith nine heads.
				<lb/>Scyla was drowned by Minos because she was a patri
				<lb/>cidal priestess. Scyla metamorphosed into a sea squid that
				<lb/>menaced Odysseus.
				<lb/>As for Minos, he was afflicted by a disorder that caused
				<lb/>him to emit snakes instead of semen. (He was cured by the
				<lb/>wife of Cephallus.)
				<lb/>Zeus attacked Typhon, a dragon whom Hera bore spon
				<lb/>taneously in revenge for the rebirth of Athene. Zeus' own
				<lb/>brainchild.
				<lb/>Typhon in turn had children by a "snake woman"; these
				<lb/>children were Cerebus and Chimaera.
				<lb/>Cerebus, a dog, wreathed with nine snakes, was captured
				<lb/>by Heracles.
				<lb/>Chimera, a she-monster with a snake’s tail, was killed by
				<lb/>Bellerophon.
				<lb/>The snake that guarded Thebes was killed by Cadmus, who
				<lb/>then won the Goddess Harmonia.
				<lb/>Medusa was a snake-wreathed Gorgon. Her name means
				<lb/>"ruler”. She was killed by Perseus the Destroyer who gave her
				<lb/>head (the Gorgon mask) to the turncoat-goddess Athene.
				<lb/>Athene wore it as her aegis (her authority).
				<lb/>The Delphic Python pursued Leto so that she could not
				<lb/>bear a son by Zeus. Leto found refuge, and her son grew to be
				<lb/>Apollo, surnamed the Destroyer.
				<lb/>Apollo destroyed the Delphic oracle and killed the
				<lb/>Pythoness.
				<lb/>Apollo also won Admetus a prized bride, Alcestis, but Ad
				<lb/>metus found the bridal chamber full of snakes, which were
				<lb/>sentby Artemis.
				<lb/>In the more recent Christian era, we are assured that St.
				<lb/>Patrick rid Ireland of its snakes.

				<lb/>Sssisters, sssisters, do not think that the great hagiocratic
				<lb/>gynocracies of the Bronze Age vanished without a trace—
				<lb/>or that they perished without a fight.
				<lb/>...The commandments, which are really eight, not ten, to
				<lb/>match the number of letters in the Name, fall into two groups:
				<lb/>one of three “ Thou Shalts” concerned with the true crea
				<lb/>tion, and the other of five “Thou Shalt Nots" concerned with
				<lb/>the false creation. ..Robert Graves1s
				<lb/>The number 8, the number of greatest reduplication, rep
				<lb/>resents the true creatrix because it also symbolizes the
				<lb/>coupling, the copulation of snakes. Robert Graves tells us
				<lb/>that in the Druidical mysteries the world began from the red
				<lb/>egg of a sea serpent; in the Orphic mysteries this egg result
				<lb/>ed from the sexual act performed between the Great God
				<lb/>dess and the World-Snake Ophion.
				<lb/>...The Great Goddess herself took the form of a snake and
				<lb/>coupled with Ophion; and the coupling of snakes in archaic
				<lb/>Greece was consequently a forbidden sight— the man who
			</p>
			<pb n='49'/>
			<p>
				<lb/>witnessed it was struck with the "female disease” he had to
				<lb/>live like a woman for seven years, which was the same punish
				<lb/>ment as was permanently inflicted on the Scythians who
				<lb/>sacked the (Philistine) Temple of the Great Goddess of As
				<lb/>kalon."
				<lb/>The usually astute Graves does not state the obvious
				<lb/>the coupling of snakes was the coupling of females. From
				<lb/>this it may be reasoned that the coupling snakes on the
				<lb/>Caduceus make that Staff of Life not only a symbol of Kun
				<lb/>dalini2° but also a symbol of parthenogenesis. Certainly the
				<lb/>earliest creation myths — instead of blaming the snake for
				<lb/>the downfall of man—credited her with the creation of life,
				<lb/>which did not originally include mankind. Only after biolog
				<lb/>ical mutation, political revolution and religious reformation
				<lb/>did the snake become abhorrent, like all things symbolic of
				<lb/>women.
				<lb/>And lest we forget, as most historians do, there were those
				<lb/>thousands upon thousands of nameless women who were
				<lb/>slaughtered as witches during the Middle Ages and later by
				<lb/>many of the luminaries of the Christian Church. They, too,
				<lb/>have their religious heritage which it might be enlightening
				<lb/>...to discover. ...Sheila Collins?
				<lb/>Scholars have noted that religions are often the conden
				<lb/>sations of former civilizations. Wicca is the condensation of
				<lb/>the ancient gynocracies, after all attempts at extermination
				<lb/>have failed. The Anglo-Saxon root wic means to bend, to be
				<lb/>pliant like a snake. The wisdom of Wicca is precisely this,
				<lb/>and every woman has this knowledge, the knowledge of her
				<lb/>compliance with nature, with the universe. This is her whole
				<lb/>ness, her oneness—which is divisible into many forms —but
				<lb/>she also knows that division creates confusion, that drawing
				<lb/>distinctions creates opposition, that enlightenment is al
				<lb/>ways a sensibility of oneness. Men in their unwholeness and
				<lb/>unholiness have divided knowledge itself into intuition, in
				<lb/>telligence, imagination, memory, belief, emotions — but all
				<lb/>these things are one ommmniscience.
				<lb/>The whole march of science toward the unification of
				<lb/>concepts— the reduction of all matter to elements and then
				<lb/>to a few types of particles, the reduction of "forces” to the
				<lb/>single concept "energy," and then the reduction of matter
				<lb/>and energy to a single basic quantity — leads still to the un
				<lb/>known. Lincoln Barnett22
				<lb/>Unfortunately this is true for men, who cannot know
				<lb/>wholeness, for they are not of a wholeness. Men are only a
				<lb/>portion of women. Thus phallicratic religious practices ob
				<lb/>scure the female principle but cannot totally abjure it. As
				<lb/>Sheila Collins has noted:
				<lb/>Many feminists and several prominent male anthropologists
				<lb/>and psychologists (for example, H.R. Hays, Theodore Reik,
				<lb/>Wolfgang Lederer, Bruno Bettleheim, Joseph Campbell) are
				<lb/>coming to the conclusion that the force of masculine am
				<lb/>bivalence towardwomen indicates the presence of a’sacrality,
				<lb/>the numinous. The truly sacred is always the focus of great
				<lb/>fear and fascination.?
				<lb/>The ultimate profanation of the sacred is the destruction
				<lb/>of creation. In envy and resentment, men have made good
				<lb/>this threat time and time again, for such is the male imper
				<lb/>ative born of an entirely natural fear of extinction. Sperm
				<lb/>banking and cloning experiments demonstrate that the re
				<lb/>duction and even the extinction of the male sex is prac
				<lb/>ticable—and history makes it warrantable. The sex, rather
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb/>than being a progenitor even on an unequal basis, has be
				<lb/>come a threat to life.
				<lb/>At this point in time a reformation is in order. The world
				<lb/>needs a new religion (or a very, very old one) that recognizes
				<lb/>the basic need of every man to become a woman. The usual
				<lb/>means of accomplishing this has been through possession.
				<lb/>Men have traditionally complemented their short-circuited
				<lb/>energies through marriage, a church-supported institution.
				<lb/>The difficulty, conveniently overlooked by patriarchs, is
				<lb/>that energy cannot be endlessly transmitted. Like all bat
				<lb/>teries, a woman must be recharged and that takes another
				<lb/>cell identical with her own, which means communion with
				<lb/>her own kind; the communion may or may not include
				<lb/>physical sex. Similarly whether a woman is in a sexual rela
				<lb/>tionship with a man is not the important factor. Any pro
				<lb/>tracted dynamic-static relationship is an unequal exchange
				<lb/>of energy with the woman short changed. To make matters
				<lb/>worse, the man often keeps his foot down on the accelerator
				<lb/>In this analogy, of course, the woman is the accelerator, and
				<lb/>when she is depleted of energy —through with giving—the
				<lb/>man seeks another woman to literally and figuratively plug
				<lb/>into. Woman Number Two will similarly be run down.
				<lb/>However, energy is not containable anyway. The individ
				<lb/>ual must decide how she will invest her life-giving energies
				<lb/>—but no man can assume the privilege of being monog
				<lb/>amous or polygamous. In the "Animal Kingdom” males are
				<lb/>exogamous, as they were in the highly civilized temple life
				<lb/>of the Bronze Age. Unfortunately the male in his separate
				<lb/>ness is covetous—and threatening to the female in her
				<lb/>wholeness. Happily, understandably, increasing numbers of
				<lb/>men actually want to become women, but they must be
				<lb/>counseled to discover patience and to foreswear bitterness.

			<p>
				<lb/>Janus, the two-faced god of doors, is a symbol of androg
				<lb/>yny. Androgyny, meaning male-female, is our present setup
				<lb/>and it is a compromise of which parthenogyns have no need.
				<lb/>Ariadne was a title used for "the most holy” Cretan priest
				<lb/>esses,25 the so-called Snake Goddesses who conducted their
				<lb/>rituals in labyrinthine temples.
				<lb/>Parthenogenesis may be more easily accomplished than
				<lb/>is popularly realized, through masturbatory techniques and,
				<lb/>in particular, through the raising of Kundalini energy into
				<lb/>the womb at the time of ovulation. In laboratory experi
				<lb/>ments mammalian ova have self-fertilized when artificially
				<lb/>stimulated by heat or shock. In fact, numerous agents have
				<lb/>been used to trigger egg cleavage in experimental animals
				<lb/>and self-fertilized eggs have developed normally in the
				<lb/>laboratory dish up to the placenta-forming stage. 26
				<lb/>The difficulty in parthenogenesis is not conception but
				<lb/>the need to counter lethal recessive characteristics. For this
				<lb/>reason the most viable species alternate between sexua
				<lb/>and parthenogenic reproduction?” Of immediate, practical
				<lb/>use is the development of ovum cloning. Combining ovum
				<lb/>with another cell provides the full complement of chromo
				<lb/>somes that are necessary to counter lethal characteristics.
				<lb/>In this connection, the persistent myth of male motherhood
				<lb/>has again surfaced and claims recently have been made of
				<lb/>the birth of a male human clone. Such an event is to be ex
				<lb/>pected, for genetic experimentation is under the control of
				<lb/>men. Among scientists, women are seldom heard from and
				<lb/>only slightly heeded, in spite of the fact that Jane Spurway's
				<lb/>university lecture in 1955 resulted in the highly probable
				<lb/>identification of a naturally produced, female, human par
				<lb/>thenogenome.28
				<lb/>Withal, the theory of immaculate conception is unshak
				<lb/>en, and for those who would try, even hesitant embryol
				<lb/>ogists admit that parthenogenesis could be occurring with
				<lb/>out resort to technology:
				<lb/>...the vast size of the human population compels the admis
				<lb/>sion that with a one-in-a-million chance there could be a
				<lb/>sprinkling of individuals in the community who have arisen
				<lb/>by this means (natural parthenogenesis). They would of course
				<lb/>be female, and would resemble their mothers very closely,
				<lb/>but otherwise need not show any tell-tale features. 29
				<lb/>Despite all the laws of men to the contrary, women irrev
				<lb/>ocably have supreme jurisdiction over life giving, but not
				<lb/>merely over life-giving replication—women’s primacy is all
				<lb/>pervasive, all-encompassing. Our reformation of society
				<lb/>need not be a mere revolution. We need not simply go the
				<lb/>opposite way; we can go the whole way

				<lb/>MIKVA DREAMS—A Performance
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb/>Mierle Laderman Ukeles
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb/>INTRODUCTORY NOTE
				<lb/>Into a particular sacred symbol of the primal water-womb, MIKVA, I enter regu
				<lb/>larly during my life’s span of natural fertility. Here, I celebrate my own menses cycle,
				<lb/>my personal holy body interface between the moon’s tides and the earth’s seasons.
				<lb/>Like most goddess traditions, MATRONIT-SHECHINA, the Jew’s Female Divinity,
				<lb/>has been pictured from ancient times as magically combining all these aspects:
				<lb/>eternal renewed virgin, and eternal passionate lover, and eternal creating mother.
				<lb/>Mikva is the site-intersection of all these holy energies.
				<lb/>My menstrual ritual is ancient, so ancient, from the very beginnings of my people's
				<lb/>history. It has survived historic catastrophes, expulsions and wanderings. It has also
				<lb/>survived—barely —these centuries' cultural hang-ups toward menstruation itself:
				<lb/>superstitions which are really fear and loathing of woman body herself, woman deep
				<lb/>mysterious fertile magic body and her times.
				<lb/>Like parasitical barnacles clinging to a truly nurturant source, misunderstandings
				<lb/>have adhered to the concept and power of the Mikva. No. Mikva is not about
				<lb/>woman as dirty. I don’t know about you, but I get dirty many times a month. And
				<lb/>when I do I take a bath.
				<lb/>Sisters! In this new time for all of us, I take this time to tell you of these private
				<lb/>things.
				<lb/>The artist unfolds a white sheet, places it over her head, covering herself completely and continues the
				<lb/>reading.
				<lb/>MIKVA DREAMS
				<lb/>The following definition of Mikva is paraphrased from Rachel Adler: Mikva is a
				<lb/>sacred water immersion place. Both men and women use the Mikva, but differently
				<lb/>It is referred to in the Bible as "“mayim chayim", meaning living waters. Running
				<lb/>water, not stagnant water. Any natural gathering of running water of requisite amount
				<lb/>constitutes a natural Mikva: lake, river, sea.
				<lb/>In cities, the Mikva is built using an approximation of natural water, that is, water
				<lb/>collected through the force of gravity, usually rainwater. The rainwater is gathered
				<lb/>into a huge container called the "bor” or pit. a building is constructed around this
				<lb/>bor. The building contains small individual sunken pools for private immersion. Each
				<lb/>pool shares a wall with the bor. Each shared wall has a hole cut in it which can be
				<lb/>plugged up or left open. In order to make the adjoining pools into legally valid
				<lb/>Makvaot, they are "seeded" with bor water and then filled with regular heated tap
				<lb/>water. When the hole between this pool and the bor is unplugged so that the waters
				<lb/>are touching (or, as the sources put it, "kissing”), the pool becomes a valid Mikva.
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb/>In all the gentleness of continuing love, she goes to the Mikva. The Mikva waters
				<lb/>hit above her breasts when she is standing up. The waters have pressure in them. She
				<lb/>pushes into it as she comes down the steps. When she leaves, it seems as if the
				<lb/>waters softly bulge her out, back to the world. No, she doesn’t want to tell you
				<lb/>about it. It is a secret between her love and herself. The Mikvah is square. The water
			</p>
			<pb n='53'/>
			<p>
				<lb/>is warm, body temperature. Sometimes there are layers of cool water at the bottom.
				<lb/>A square womb of living waters.
				<lb/>She goes in, naked, all dead edges removed—edges and surfaces that have come
				<lb/>in contact with the world. Nails, loose hair. She has scrubbed herself. All foreign
				<lb/>matter removed. A discipline. Is it possible to cleanse oneself completely? What if
				<lb/>she looked into a microscope? Would she find foreign matter? The standard is the
				<lb/>world of the naked eye. The Mikva is for her intrinsic self. Her self-self. Nothing
				<lb/>else: no traffic with the world, no make-up with the world. The blood stopped
				<lb/>flowing a week ago. She is the moon. The blood carried away the nest for an un
				<lb/>fertilized egg. Her body gets ready every month—builds a nest come hell or high
				<lb/>water. If the egg isn’t caught and doesn’t catch, the nest unravels bit by bit, and the
				<lb/>body gets rid of it. Shucks it. A non-life has occurred. Shall she call it a death? She
				<lb/>won’t because of sister-friends who have had abortions for a million sorrowing
				<lb/>reasons. What’s one egg? She can’t bear that many children. Overpopulation, desires
				<lb/>for limits, human endurance, etc. etc. etc. etc. etc. Money, education, other kinds
				<lb/>of life-giving to do.
				<lb/>But it is an event of non-life. An egg’s funeral. A formal procession in measured
				<lb/>amounts of time, not rushed; so-and-so number of days. Men don’t bleed regularly
				<lb/>That’s a simple fact. If they bleed, something is wrong. Women do bleed regularly.
				<lb/>It’s not an androgynous fact. Much as the artist loves androgynous facts. It is a
				<lb/>separating fact. Also children. Only women bleed regularly. Regularly they are in
				<lb/>volved in either new life or non-life. The Mikva separates one from the other.
				<lb/>In all the glory of continuing love, the Mikva is a taste of Heaven. She tumbles
				<lb/>down into the water, like a fetus, and is reborn to life. Old surfaces gone, non-life
				<lb/>gone. Life is holy, to be understood as holy and separated from Death, from dead
				<lb/>parts. She is always holy—but she causes a separation to be made between life and
				<lb/>non-life.
				<lb/>Choose life the Holy One tells her and she does.
				<lb/>If Heaven is the home of eternal life, in all the caring of continuing love, the
				<lb/>Mikva is a room in Heaven. This is what Heaven is like, she thought. How out-
				<lb/>rageous. This? Tiles, steps, a light. What did she expect? The Shomeret, the guardian,
				<lb/>is this Heaven’s angel. A real angel who maintains the balance between this secret
				<lb/>place and outside, mysterious, telling no tales. The Shomeret’s job is to watch. To
				<lb/>see that no foreign bodies are on her. That she has twenty new edges on her twenty
				<lb/>tips—nails and toes—that meet the world, that grow and die always. Mostly, the
				<lb/>Shomeret watches silently that all of her is drawn into the water—nothing sticks out
				<lb/>when she contracts back into the womb of warm waters. Every part must go into
				<lb/>the waters or it's not "kasher”. “Kasher” means okay, proper. The girl-woman
				<lb/>lifebearer, who has passed through a time of non-life, enters wholly into the living
				<lb/>waters one time. “Kasher” says the Shomeret. She praises G-D, life-death maintainer,
				<lb/>who was-is-will-be forever. Twice more she enters the waters. Sees her fingers through
				<lb/>the waters, spreads her limbs; the waters press against her openings; she opens
				<lb/>herself to the waters. “Kasher, says the Shomeret. Then she is reborn. The living
				<lb/>waters return her to life alone.
				<lb/>Her cells begin to die again immediately. Her womb begins to build its blood-nest
				<lb/>again. Foreign matter makes contact and sticks to her, silently, right away. But she
				<lb/>has a chance to start again.
				<lb/>She moves into another time period. Month to month, how many months, how
				<lb/>many contacts does the girl-woman have on this bridge between herself alone and
				<lb/>the future?
				<lb/>Say she starts menses at thirteen and reaches menopause at forty-eight. That's
				<lb/>thirty-five years of possible fertilization times twelve months a year equals four
				<lb/>hundred-twenty eggs she grows within her. Say she gets married at twenty-eight and
				<lb/>goes to the Mikva from that time on. That gives her twenty Mikva-going years times
				<lb/>twelve months a year, or two hundred-forty times to go to the Mikva. Say she has
			</p>
			<pb n='54'/>
			<p>
				<lb/>one, two, three children. That means twenty-seven months of no menses—round off
				<lb/>to thirty months "off" because of afterbirth bleeding. That means roughly two
				<lb/>hundred and ten times to go to the Mikva during her life; two hundred and ten times
				<lb/>to separate from events of non-life in her life. Two hundred and ten times to im
				<lb/>merse, to go down into, be swallowed by the people’s womb of living waters, to
				<lb/>come back to life just as her people’s women have done for so many thousands of
				<lb/>years.
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb/>In all the maintenance of continuing love, her own specific, particular kind of
				<lb/>moon-blood body in nature dies in those waters and is born again. And immerse
				<lb/>again

				<lb/>The Many Paths of Feminist Spirituality
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb/>Upon reading the many contributions that were sub
				<lb/>mitted to the Heresies Creat Coddess Issue, we found it
				<lb/>interesting —we hope you will too—that quite a few of the
				<lb/>articles were concerned with the concept of Coddess or
				<lb/>divine female principle within the context of other exist
				<lb/>ent religious structures. We present here some excerpts of
				<lb/>the ideas and attitudes that were expressed.
				<lb/>Surely there is no one path to our growing understand
				<lb/>ing of feminist spirituality. We are each in a constant
				<lb/>process of transition. Perhaps by becoming more aware of
				<lb/>the many places from which we are coming and the many
				<lb/>paths we are taking, we may gain a better understanding
				<lb/>ot where we are going.
				<lb/>Our Mother Who Art in Heaven
				<lb/>... the Virgin Mary serves not only as a vehicle for
				<lb/>recruiting those followers of pagan cults which had a
				<lb/>female form of deity but also as a means of diffusing any
				<lb/>vestiges of power of the Mother Goddess in the minds of
				<lb/>women
				<lb/>Woman’s role as mother has been rigidly structured
				<lb/>into an ideal which is all-loving, all-giving, for the ben
				<lb/>efit of males, infant and grown. ... The Greek Goddess
				<lb/>Demeter, through her relationship to her daughter Per
				<lb/>sephone, provided her human daughters with a source of
				<lb/>spiritual nurturance sadly lacking in the Christian God
				<lb/>the Father whose concern, laced with authoritarianism,
				<lb/>was directed towards a son. Since the mother of the
				<lb/>Christian "Son of God" was human, her only course of
				<lb/>action lay in submission to the male deities, Father and
				<lb/>Son. Demeter, like the Virgin Mary, demonstrated grief
				<lb/>and forbearance, but, because she was divine she had
				<lb/>the power of her anger.
				<lb/>Since it is largely the feminine principle that has been
				<lb/>denied power by Christian concepts, the necessary evo
				<lb/>lutionary step in Western religion is the rediscovery of
				<lb/>the missing truths embodied in a Heavenly Mother.
				<lb/>Jaci Schacht
				<lb/>The Goddess in Islam
				<lb/>It is my belief that a goddess exists in Islam. She
				<lb/>emerges from the pre-Islamic religions of Arabia, is al
				<lb/>most eradicated by Mohammed’s promotion of the male
				<lb/>god, Allah, and finally returns through Sufi mystics and
				<lb/>poets. The more popular forms of Islam stress the proto
				<lb/>type of woman as Eve while the esoteric Sufi branch
				<lb/>invokes the female powers of the cosmos such as Layla
				<lb/>or 'Night' and al Rahman or Divine Mercy and Love,
				<lb/>also known as the Virgin Mary. Due to the long-time
				<lb/>ambiguity towards Her, she has remained the veiled god
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb/>dess who continuously haunts the desert traveler like the
				<lb/>memory of an oasis.
				<lb/>Her presence may appear unusual in Islam, an ap
				<lb/>parently macho’ religion that refers to the female as ’she
				<lb/>and the male as ’you' in the Koran. Thus Her roots must
				<lb/>be sought in pre-Islamic religions. Centuries before Is
				<lb/>lam, a relationship thrived between the Goddess and the
				<lb/>woman as judge, leader or priestess. Ishtar, the Lady of
				<lb/>Vision, was worshipped in Mesopotamia, Isis and Maat
				<lb/>in Egypt, Inanna in Sumer and Astarte, the Queen of
				<lb/>Heaven, in Phoenicia. Such cultures endowed the female
				<lb/>with supreme standing. In the erasing of such a role by
				<lb/>the rise of a patriarchal society, the prominent Arabian
				<lb/>goddesses such as Allat, Manat and Uzza gradually be
				<lb/>came the ’daughters of Allah'...Of further interest is the
				<lb/>potential parallel between the names of the goddess
				<lb/>Allat and Allah, the Islamic god. It is known that the
				<lb/>names of the new male gods were often the adopted and
				<lb/>changed names of the earlier female deities.
				<lb/>Joan L. Sharp
				<lb/>Feminism in Judaism
				<lb/>While the feminine aspects of Judaism have been
				<lb/>overlaid by the masculine aspects, both in fact and at
				<lb/>titude, the dormant seeds of a Goddess-influenced origin
				<lb/>must be unearthed and replanted in fertile soil in order
				<lb/>to establish a meaningful connection between Judaism
				<lb/>and feminism. The continuous movement in Judaism
				<lb/>away from the original nature cults towards the celebra
				<lb/>tion of historical events is perhaps the single most im
				<lb/>portant factor that contributed to the suppression of
				<lb/>women. Research into the various beliefs held with re
				<lb/>gard to the earliest holy day observances would be a
				<lb/>starting point for Jewish feminists to re-establish their
				<lb/>feminist connections within the religion.
				<lb/>In earliest times the date of all Jewish festivals was
				<lb/>established by the rising of the new moon and many
				<lb/>scholars believe that the original Sabbath was observed
				<lb/>once a month at the time of the moon’s rising. The figure
				<lb/>of the Shekhinah, the female aspect of God, is the Sab
				<lb/>bath Queen whose praises resound in the temple that
				<lb/>She might return from her self-imposed exile. One of Her
				<lb/>images is that of the new moon which suddenly appears
				<lb/>after her dark phase to illuminate the sky again. The very
				<lb/>ancient connection of the Sabbath with the new moon is
				<lb/>one that still survives in much altered form in the sanc
				<lb/>tifying of the new moon, a ritual that many women are
				<lb/>reviving in the Sabbath worship.

				<lb/>Signore Alberto Muscarotti was chief of security
				<lb/>of the Uffizi Gallery in Florence. For twenty years.
				<lb/>A man of singular solitary habits. An anachro
				<lb/>nism in sophisticated Florence, he was a devout
				<lb/>man. A Roman Catholic communist.
				<lb/>His habits were immaculate. He kept his present
				<lb/>three-room domicile as clean as a monk’s cell. And
				<lb/>he was especially devoted to the Blessed Virgin.
				<lb/>As way of example of his extreme moral impec
				<lb/>cability, after his dear wife had passed on, he had
				<lb/>begun masturbating. In the beginning, remembering
				<lb/>those early days of connubial bliss, he had used
				<lb/>those blessed memories with which to stimulate his
				<lb/>hypothalamus. But, as time went on, he caught him
				<lb/>self phantasizing a face, which although it seemed
				<lb/>familiar, still eluded him.
				<lb/>Some female visitor to the Gallery, no doubt. Yet
				<lb/>the face was so transportive, so ideal, that he racked
				<lb/>his brain upon awakening to fullfillment in order to
				<lb/>trace his now steady, if only, imaginary lover.
				<lb/>Imagine his shock, and self-disgust, upon coming
				<lb/>to an early shift, at 4:00 a.m., and noticing that the
				<lb/>face (and breasts this time) of his last evening's
				<lb/>sexual feast were of no other than the Blessed Virgin
				<lb/>Herself. At this discovery, Muscarotti fell to his
				<lb/>knees.
				<lb/>Fortunately, no one saw him. By the time his
				<lb/>staff of guards came through to bid him a good day
				<lb/>he had almost recovered. But from that day on,
				<lb/>there were no more nightly pleasures
				<lb/>Now, it was 4:30 a.m. He had had his coffee and
				<lb/>biscotti. And he was prepared to slowly do the
				<lb/>rounds
				<lb/>He preferred to leave the lights on in all the inner
				<lb/>chambers. And, as he entered the tiny room where
				<lb/>all was gold and ivory; diptychs and triptychs of the
				<lb/>Annunciation. Of the Nativity. Of the Assumption,
				<lb/>he lingered. It was his favorite room
				<lb/>"One moment — all was in its place,” these were
				<lb/>the exact words that Signore Muscarotti used in
				<lb/>describing the events to Svar Chimo of the Italian Six
				<lb/>O’Clock News “...And then the chamber filled with
				<lb/>a bluish radiance. I thought at first it was a powel
				<lb/>failure. Although at that time of the morning—"Mus
				<lb/>carotti shook his head. "Anyway, bluish haloes af
				<lb/>fixed themselves, 1 cannot think of a better word, to
				<lb/>all the images of. ..of. ..the Blessed Virgin, and —”
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb/>Here the old man’s voice faltered
				<lb/>"And then—the treasures themselves were gone.
				<lb/>Even the hard-bitten unshaven cameraman was
				<lb/>unduly solemn. He kept his eyes fixed on the man as
				<lb/>though he were the last survivor of a terrible plane
				<lb/>crash
				<lb/>"What was your first feeling?” asked Chimo. The
				<lb/>usually caustic reporter was very courteous to the
				<lb/>old guard. Even gentle. Muscarotti, in fact, seemed
				<lb/>on the verge of tears. Or, an emotional breakdówn.
				<lb/>"Yes," Chimo said patiently, "yes. Take your
				<lb/>time, Signore Muscarotti, there is no hurry here.
				<lb/>"The best way to describe this to you — is this.
				<lb/>His arm designated an arc. “This room was filled
				<lb/>with the spoils and treasures of countless Roman
				<lb/>and Italian victories. You see for yourself, it is quite
				<lb/>empty. So much for the room itself. But, what has
				<lb/>happened here —” Muscarotti pointed to his heart.
				<lb/>"A long time ago, I attended church because due to
				<lb/>some custodial mishap, I slipped and fell into a
				<lb/>baptismal font. And I was Christianized. I am an il
				<lb/>legitimate orphan.
				<lb/>"You, too," wondered Chimo inaudibly.
				<lb/>"l hate the Roman Catholic church.
				<lb/>Chimo’s face broke into a sunrise of smiles
				<lb/>"But l have only one weakness,” Muscarotti con

				<lb/>Tears and miracles on TV but there was panic in the
				<lb/>world of art throughout the world. As statuary,
				<lb/>entire walls, sides of mountains, paintings, draw
				<lb/>ings, miniatures, murals, diptychs, palimpsests, trip
				<lb/>tychs, apses, and tapestries vanished, taking with
				<lb/>them every image of the Godess, the Blessed Virgin,
				<lb/>and all the female (and male aspects) of the Great
				<lb/>Mother.
				<lb/>In the realm of coins, figurines, and jewels, it was
				<lb/>as if they had never existed. Ruins of temples to the
				<lb/>Godess crumbled to dust. The Florentines thought
				<lb/>that the Communist government had conspired to
				<lb/>devastate "all the decadent symbols of spirituality."”
				<lb/>The Parisians thought that the Germans were finally
				<lb/>paying them back for winning World War II.
				<lb/>In London, and in New York City, there were
				<lb/>blood baths. Among three outstanding groups: the
				<lb/>Waisties (the very long-haired); the Shoulders
				<lb/>(medium-long haired); and the Necks (the Conserva
				<lb/>tives).
				<lb/>Here and abroad, each art group being com
				<lb/>prised mainly of a rather wide spectrum of fairies
				<lb/>and non-fairies who controlled galleries and muse
				<lb/>ums, newspaper columns and art periodicals, and
				<lb/>who for the main part adored statues, paintings, and
				<lb/>all other objets d’art of the ideal woman, rather than
				<lb/>women themselves
				<lb/>But inasmuch as the art scene was their thing,
				<lb/>these men were considerably upset to find the cri
				<lb/>terion of beauty in woman vanished; and left, for the
				<lb/>first time in the history of art — if not of the world
				<lb/>— with absolutely no criterion at all.
				<lb/>In India, Shiva, always presumed to be a male
				<lb/>deity, and Kali, ran in liquid gold, silver, obsidian
				<lb/>and mud before the horrified eyes of the worship
				<lb/>pers. Two hundred million faithful drowned them
				<lb/>selves in the Ganges. Gangadevi restored them im
				<lb/>mediately as clouds of water over drought areas.
				<lb/>There were those who saw the images of Vishnu,
				<lb/>Rama, and Krishna dissolve into miraculously
				<lb/>scented flames of hyacinth, dark azure, copper, and
				<lb/>golden yellow.
				<lb/>Another three hundred million flung themselves
				<lb/>into the Sacred Flames. The Godess of Fire reincar
				<lb/>nated these into wheatfields. (Waste not, want not.)
				<lb/>Leaving India for the first time in centuries as the
				<lb/>most underpopulated area on earth, not counting
				<lb/>desert and arctic regions.
				<lb/>A few thousand British soldiers who were there as
				<lb/>"observers” accidentally perished among the sacred
				<lb/>suicides, and these were not reincarnated into
				<lb/>wheatfields, but the British government was quite
				<lb/>tolerant. "Food" was still moving briskly into the
				<lb/>Dominions. These shipments had increased as soon
				<lb/>as the Blessed Vanishments had occurred, thanks
				<lb/>to the British "observers.
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb/>The images which had melted in India, dissolved
				<lb/>in counterpart as well throughout the world. In the
				<lb/>theological past, the faithful of each particular reli
				<lb/>gion as well as the art historians had sincerely be
				<lb/>lieved all these aspects to have been "male. It was
				<lb/>only after the Great Famine which followed the
				<lb/>Aweful Law of No Decay, and the Sacred Vanish
				<lb/>ments, that the world realized these "gods" were but
				<lb/>male images of the Great Godess
				<lb/>In the center of chaos, the Great Mother came to
				<lb/>our galaxy in the aspect of Ishtar, the deity wor
				<lb/>shipped for the longest time in the history of human
				<lb/>kind. Ishtar illumined the souls of children, women
				<lb/>and men, which had lain in darkness before and
				<lb/>after the Sumerians. Ninmah, the Mother Godess of
				<lb/>the Sumerian Kosmos, Mother of all the gods,
				<lb/>Mother of Creation, known to Sumerian astronomers
				<lb/>as the Exalted Lady. Ninmah had appeared to the
				<lb/>Sumerians, in the sky, the same way that Ishtar had
				<lb/>approached our universe: clothed in a supernova.
				<lb/>From that illumination in Sumeria had come the first
				<lb/>inscription on a tiny tablet; mathematics; the wheel;
				<lb/>astronomy; and religion. The Tablets of Creation
				<lb/>describe the struggle among the demigods within
				<lb/>the primordial mother (Tiamat’s belly). Marduk,
				<lb/>killer of Tiamat, transformed in the Greek sky as
				<lb/>Jupiter. The same Marduk known now among the
				<lb/>Jews as Yaweh.
				<lb/>In India, a few Indian wiseacres known as Vama-
				<lb/>charis (or the Vamamargis), followers of the left
				<lb/>(and feminine) path, had by the Grace of Ishtar fol
				<lb/>lowed the Sacred Female Aspect correctly.
				<lb/>These died along with the ignorant faithful, but
				<lb/>were immediately re-incarnated into WA-WACS
				<lb/>wealthy-Americans-with-a-conscience. The WA
				<lb/>WACs, a weird group even for America, did some
				<lb/>strange things. They championed the Bill of Rights,
				<lb/>along with the remaining 400 Native Americans, that
				<lb/>number having escaped being eaten during the Great
				<lb/>Famine. Some WA-WACs even armed themselves,
				<lb/>and kept watch on reservations, calling themselves
				<lb/>the Arm of Bartelomeo de Las Casas. These were
				<lb/>joined by crackpot Catholics, Jews, Ishtarians, Uni
				<lb/>tarians and Quakers. And among these were nuns,
				<lb/>seminarians, priests, a bishop, and even one cardinal.
				<lb/>The WA-WACs gave assist and money anony
				<lb/>mously to the much-feared Women’s Army for
				<lb/>Peace. (An armed militant splinter group: 1,500,000
				<lb/>women who airlifted women and children out of war
				<lb/>zones; and who legally robbed rich men to give back
				<lb/>money to the poor.)
				<lb/>These matriots arose as one from the ranks of
				<lb/>mothers, daughters, "sweethearts, sisters, and
				<lb/>wives of men wounded or killed by war. They had
				<lb/>made their bones on a non-violent (well, technically
				<lb/>non-violent) coup.
				<lb/>At the height of the Great Famine, amid world
				<lb/>chaos, W.A.P. platoons had kidnapped 140 Ameri
				<lb/>can and foreign generals, 25 admirals and 4 captains
				<lb/>of oil tankers (which had caused major oil spills).
				<lb/>Flown them here, bound, blindfolded, and gagged,
				<lb/>to a-landfill in Jersey. Lowered them gently into a
			</p>
			<pb n='58'/>
			<p>
				<lb/>prepared funnel-pit, 120 feet deep, 20 feet wide at
				<lb/>the top, 10 feet wide at the bottom. Five-hundred
				<lb/>and fifty thousand war widows, war mothers, war
				<lb/>orphans, and war "sweethearts” had filed past the
				<lb/>entrenched warriors. And flung (loosely) saran
				<lb/>wrapped personal excrement into the entrenchment.
				<lb/>The patriots had died bravely.
				<lb/>Before leaving, a W.A.P. trumpeter had sounded
				<lb/>national and international taps. And their country's
				<lb/>flags had been implanted at the summit.
				<lb/>One week later, they had abducted the-then
				<lb/>President. By mistake. Returned him unharmed. Ex
				<lb/>cept for emotional shock. They had mistaken him
				<lb/>for the-then chief of the FBI.
				<lb/>But they had lost their opportunity. To the over
				<lb/>whelming relief of everyone, the-then FBI chief had
				<lb/>finally resigned. (The chief had been seated right
				<lb/>next to the-then President when the abduction had
				<lb/>taken place.) What W.A.P. had planned to do with
				<lb/>the now ex-FBI chief was not revealed. The next day,
				<lb/>15 cadres of terrorists around the world responsible
				<lb/>for the deaths or maiming of women and children
				<lb/>were found dead. A spokesperson for the Women's
				<lb/>Army for Peace had demanded, and had received, a
				<lb/>live newscast. She had appeared on camera as heav
				<lb/>ily veiled as a prized female slave of an Arab prince.
				<lb/>"We have relieved 75 admirals and 140 generals
				<lb/>and 4 captains at their posts of duty. We hope that
				<lb/>their replacements will be attuned to peace instead
				<lb/>of war. As for the terrorists, women are no longer
				<lb/>killing women for male schemes. We realize, she
				<lb/>continued, "that men view war and violence as an
				<lb/>inherent part of life. We plan to interfere only inso
				<lb/>far as the killing of women and children is con
				<lb/>cerned. We intend to reduce all war efforts to hand
				<lb/>to-hand combat.
				<lb/>"Do you have any plans to implement this—ah
				<lb/>Utopian dream?” inquired the silver-templed prince
				<lb/>of the all-male media.
				<lb/>The woman removed her veils carefully, one by
				<lb/>one, until there was only a single veil left. “There
				<lb/>are many among us who wish to bring peace and
				<lb/>plenty to the earth.
				<lb/>Aren’t you hedging the question?” asked the
				<lb/>smart-assed 49-year-old male interviewer
				<lb/>"No, the spokesperson replied. “We have a

				<lb/>But to return to the Sacred Vanishments, and as
				<lb/>an example of the extreme preciseness of these
				<lb/>miracles — In Boston, the la Orana Maria had burst
				<lb/>into flames, burning a hole in the exquisite Gauguin
				<lb/>canvas as a blue-veined, blue-haired, blue-nosed
				<lb/>SAR (Sons of the American Revolution) was looking
				<lb/>at it. He died of heart arrest on the gold-veined
				<lb/>marble floor that his late father had payed for at his
				<lb/>bequest.

			<p>
				<lb/>At Lourdes, the entire shrine had risen shimmer
				<lb/>ingly into the sunlit air. Then at the height of one
				<lb/>thousand feet, it had ignited—in the shape of
				<lb/>flowers. And vanished. At the shrine of Our Lady of
				<lb/>Fatima, in Portugal, the same, excepting that here,
				<lb/>in addition, it rained cherries embedded in hail
				<lb/>stones for one hour.
				<lb/>But in Rome—as in Florence—super-miracles
				<lb/>occurred. To this day, the body of Christ hangs
				<lb/>suspended without the marble counterpart of the
				<lb/>Blessed Virgin. In the larger Pieta of the cathedral in
				<lb/>Florence, the same phenomenon prevails. An in
				<lb/>teresting outcome of these miracles was the total
				<lb/>conversion of the Protestant Irish to the worship of
				<lb/>the Godess, and the complete overthrow of the
				<lb/>British in Ireland, ending the hypocritical Pax. There
				<lb/>were dark rumors of England “testing” a plutonium
				<lb/>bomb over Ireland, but the prevailing winds were
				<lb/>too strong in the direction of England.
				<lb/>It is difficult to describe adequately the vast air
				<lb/>of gloom and melancholia which pervaded the earth
				<lb/>devoid of the Blessed Aspect of the Godess—in all
				<lb/>Her forms.
				<lb/>The survivors had buried (or had eaten) their dead.
				<lb/>And the living went on, but the Godessless atmos
				<lb/>phere grinded and grated on everyone’s nerves.
				<lb/>Sculptors and painters copied furiously (these
				<lb/>commissioned by the state, for the first time since
				<lb/>the Renaissance), but within twenty-four hours of
				<lb/>the Godess’s Visit to our galaxy, no image, in ab
				<lb/>stract or realistic form, remained.
				<lb/>The encyclopedias of art and the Britannica,
				<lb/>riddled with holes, as were all other reference and art
				<lb/>books now without Her Image, became worthless. In
				<lb/>Egypt, counterparts of Isis dissolved in ascending
				<lb/>columns of green and red fire waves which shot up
				<lb/>with nuclear force, three thousand feet into the air.
				<lb/>Causing an air alert in the-then peaceful Middle East.
				<lb/>At the same time, all the dams burst draining the
				<lb/>waters of the Nile, revealing ancient statues of the
				<lb/>dynastic past.
				<lb/>Another super-phenomenon was that even after
				<lb/>the Great One’s Visit, onto the unknowable
				<lb/>present and future, no aspect of Her was/is durable,
				<lb/>beyond a few moments, excepting those images
				<lb/>which were/are created by women artists and
				<lb/>women sculptors.
				<lb/>More awesome still, the Sphinx Herself burned
				<lb/>molten hot, transforming the sands into a solid sheet
				<lb/>of glass, where She had lain mysterious for thou
				<lb/>sands of years.
				<lb/>In Persia and in the Yucatan, the smaller Sphinxes
				<lb/>burned the same. While in Haiti, the Voodoo Godess,
				<lb/>Mother of the Earth, was swept by fireballs from the
				<lb/>heavens, and consumed.
				<lb/>And lastly, Greece and Sicily, where many ruins
				<lb/>of shrines and temples had survived even the on
				<lb/>slaught of war and centuries, now resembled the
				<lb/>craters of the moon.
				<lb/>A glory vanished forever.

				<lb/>I have always had a deep reverence for nature, for all the creatures and elements of the earth. I felt this to be a spiritual or even a "re
				<lb/>ligious” involvement, as if nature and myself were connected in a holistic way. Why? Imagine a child hearing two stories — one about Jesus
				<lb/>Christ, his sexless origin, his trials, triumphs through pain, ungenerous reception and cruel execution; the other about "Mother Nature," he
				<lb/>sensuousness, her solicitude toward all creatures, her infinite beauty and her refusal to die. The first story cuts down the creative force anc
				<lb/>offers a dubious "other world" reward through suffering and submission. The second offers freedom and the creative experience as a supreme
				<lb/>joy that compensates for suffering. An intuitive part of me chose "Mother Nature” and the positive creative principle as an ally. As a child of
				<lb/>Nature, I believed the story of an eternity I could see each spring. As an adult, I realize that now our only visible eternity is threatened. We are in
				<lb/>a symbiotic relationship with the earth, and what we do to its physical and spiritual resources is what we are doing to ourselves. Oun

			<p>
				<lb/>saturday at 6:50 am a group of us celebrated the vernal equinox in the park
				<lb/>across the street in the manner of chinese peasants. there are two physical
				<lb/>manifestatíons of the special pull of gravity at the moment of the equinox
				<lb/>which we attempted. for a time surrounding the equinox it is possible to stand
				<lb/>an egg on end, this is true and we saw it. the egg feels discernibly heavier and
				<lb/>you can feel the yolk moving around on the inside seeking its balance in the
				<lb/>universe. so we stood egg on end in the park and at least one on every
				<lb/>body's counter for the good luck that observing such a phenomena can bring.
				<lb/>the other demonstration is to dig a hole and stand a hollow joint of bamboo in
				<lb/>it leaving about an inch sticking above the ground and drop a goose down
				<lb/>feather into it. at the moment of the equinox the feather flies up out of the
				<lb/>earth. this is true but we did not see it, it coudn't work because the ground in
				<lb/>the park is not really part of the greater ground. for all intents and purposes it's
				<lb/>a flower box sitting on the roof of the parking garage which is on top of the
				<lb/>subway tunnels but anyway just seeing the eggs was enough to erase the ef
				<lb/>feets of an extremely difficult pisces and mark the true beginning of another

				<lb/>The Eternal Weaver
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb/>Buffie Johnson and Tracy Boyd
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb/>The mysteries that for millennia were preserved in the
				<lb/>temples of the Great Coddess by her priestesses and priests
				<lb/>are, for the most part, mysteries of life and death and, in
				<lb/>the process of unveiling them, we are confronted by some
				<lb/>thing infinitely larger than we can imagine: thousands upon
				<lb/>thousands of years of magic and healing. As the Goddess's
				<lb/>symbols are revealed, it becomes apparent that the Fem
				<lb/>inine in all its manifold aspects is the bringer of conscious
				<lb/>ness and wisdom.
				<lb/>One of her most potent images is that of the eternal
				<lb/>weaver. That weaving was exclusively the art of women is
				<lb/>by now well established; however, the more far-reaching im
				<lb/>plications with regard to the worship of a female divinity
				<lb/>are described only in vague references here and there. Thus
				<lb/>the mysteries that weaving once symbolized remain to be
				<lb/>woven into a pattern that will ultimately reveal the Goddess
				<lb/>at its center.
				<lb/>The diamond-shaped "kilim" pattern that appears from
				<lb/>one of the earliest levels onward (from c. 6400 to 5700 B.C.)
				<lb/>in the wall paintings of the goddess-worshipping site of
				<lb/>Catal Huyuk in Anataolia is an indication that
				<lb/>"kilims have been woven in Anatolia since the late seventh
				<lb/>millennium B.C. or for at least the last eight thousand years."
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb/>FIG. 1 "Kilim" pattern design from Catal Huyuk (c. 6400-5700 B.C.)
				<lb/>The "kilim" design, reserved exclusively for the shrines of
				<lb/>the goddess, appears even before her anthropomorphized
				<lb/>images at the site, and is probably a representation of her
				<lb/>birth-giving womb in geometric abstraction. There is cer
				<lb/>tainly a wealth of images at Catal Huyuk depicting the
				<lb/>theme of a goddess of life and death to support this idea,
				<lb/>and there is monumental evidence outside of Catal Huyuk
				<lb/>The diamond-glyph shape, even as far back as Upper Paleo
				<lb/>lithic times, represents not only the womb, but implies the
				<lb/>idea of a female divinity as universal source and origin of all
				<lb/>life. The geometric hieroglyph is found in the earliest art of
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb/>the Upper Paleolithic and continues cross-culturally for
				<lb/>some thirty-thousand years into the iconography of Judaeo
				<lb/>Christian art. It is not then by mere chance that the diamond
				<lb/>design at Catal Huyuk is the same pattern that is a prom
				<lb/>inent feature of the "Eye Dazzler” rugs woven by Navajo
				<lb/>women.
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb/>Seen as womb, the universality of the diamond-glyph
				<lb/>pattern supports the analysis of modern dreams which has
				<lb/>shownthat
				<lb/>"the mystery of giving birth is basically associated with the
				<lb/>idea of spinning and weaving.”2
				<lb/>The thread motif, which incorporates the idea of spinning,
				<lb/>weaving and a complexity of beliefs in the knot as an instru
				<lb/>ment of magic and the weaving of spells, runs throughout
				<lb/>the tradition of the mythology of rebirth and its attendant ar
				<lb/>tifacts; whatever form it takes, it is always associated with
				<lb/>the realm of the Feminine. The motif survives even in the
				<lb/>fairytales of Europe in which the themes of spinning and
				<lb/>weaving are frequently encountered. There are as many
				<lb/>variations on the symbolic thread device as there are names
				<lb/>of goddesses, and what is described in many of the myths
				<lb/>are rites of initiation that facilitate the passages from one
				<lb/>stage of life, or consciousness, to the next, over which the
				<lb/>Goddess, or an emblem of her, presides as “mistress of initi
				<lb/>ation.
				<lb/>The analogy between initiation and death is shown in a
				<lb/>great many initiatory rites and accompanying myths of the
			</p>
			<pb n='65'/>
			<p>
				<lb/>primitive world. Initiation, which means introduction to a
				<lb/>mystery, frequently incorporates a ritual entry into a rep
				<lb/>resentation of the womb. The same pattern is found
				<lb/>"in a large number of initiatory myths and rites. The idea of
				<lb/>gestation and childbirth is expressed by... entrance in the
				<lb/>womb of the Great Mother (Earth Mother), or into the body of
				<lb/>a sea monster, or of a wild beast!!!"
				<lb/>The symbolic return to the womb is probably intended to
				<lb/>recall an earlier memory of being torn to pieces in the vagi
				<lb/>nal "teeth” of the Earth Mother, or of being swallowed into
				<lb/>the belly of the monster. Although the rituals are often
				<lb/>marked by an element of terror and risk, the emphasis is
				<lb/>placed on mystery rather than actual danger or peril. The
				<lb/>initiate merely acts out a ritual death in a quest for the sa
				<lb/>cred and mysterious forces that will guarantee regeneration
				<lb/>In the much-romanticized Cretan myth of the Minotaur,
				<lb/>Theseus embarked upon a "typical initiatory ordeal (char
				<lb/>acterized by) the ’struggle with a monster... representing
				<lb/>the forces of the unconscious”;“ an initiation made "by way
				<lb/>of ritual entry into a labyrinth."5 Theseus is the acknowl
				<lb/>edged hero, and yet the real credit for his success belongs to
				<lb/>Ariadne ("Mother of the Barley”). She is the sister of the
				<lb/>Minotaur, daughter of Pasiphae and Minos, and is associat
				<lb/>ed with the labyrinth in one of its earliest known written ref
				<lb/>erences, a Mycenaean Linear B tablet from Knossos iden
				<lb/>tifying her as "goddess of the labyrinth" and "mistress of
				<lb/>initiation."* The legend relates that having fallen in love
				<lb/>with the Athenian youth, the fair Ariadne offered Theseus a
				<lb/>ball of golden thread (the weaver’s clue) which enabled him
				<lb/>to retrace his steps and find his way out of the labyrinth
				<lb/>The labyrinth is the way, the passage leading to the cen
				<lb/>ter which is the path to consciousness and it is Ariadne
				<lb/>as "goddess of the labyrinth” and “mistress of initiation,
				<lb/>who provides the knowledge of the way by means of the
				<lb/>"thread of initiation.
				<lb/>The palace of Knossos was itself called labyrinthos, or
				<lb/>"the palace of the double axes"; and both the labyrinth, a
				<lb/>universal symbol of the uterine maze, and the double axe
				<lb/>(or labrys), derive their meaning from the word labrys (lip),
				<lb/>which specifically refers to the female labia protecting the
				<lb/>dark entrance to the womb. The labrys, the highly venerated
				<lb/>crescent-shaped double axe, an instrument of sacrifice and
				<lb/>death, is thus an emblem of the fertile womb of the Creat
				<lb/>Goddess.
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb/>In many parts of the world women have introduced the
				<lb/>labyrinth motif, as in the contemporary Stone Age level cul
				<lb/>ture of Malekula near the New Hebrides, where the de
				<lb/>ceased must "thread their way. .. through a maze-like de
				<lb/>sign drawn in the sand by the Guardian Chost,”” a being of
				<lb/>undetermined sex who lives in a cave and who is often
				<lb/>regarded as female. The ritual sand tracings, originally
				<lb/>drawn by women as they still are in some places, are in
				<lb/>tricately woven labyrinthine webs; their central structure,
				<lb/>frequently shaped like the diamond-glyph, is a representa
				<lb/>tion of the tomb. Other examples of this may be seen in
				<lb/>"parts of Scotland and north England (where today) women
				<lb/>draw. .."tangled thried' designs on their thresholds and hearth
				<lb/>stones as a prophylactic against evil influences and witches."s
				<lb/>And in South India where similar threshold designs are
				<lb/>made.
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb/>Images of the diamond-shaped glyph and the Evil Eye are
				<lb/>known to serve similar apotropaic* functions;” and the
				<lb/>spider, as spinner of the labyrinthine web, is often mentioned
				<lb/>in this connection. The word "spider” actually derives from
				<lb/>the Old English root spinnan, "to spin,” or"to draw out and
				<lb/>twist fibers into thread”"; as does the word "spinster,” whose
				<lb/>original meaning was "a woman who spins thread or yarn.
				<lb/>The spider is a symbol of the devouringwomb
				<lb/>"...not only because it devours the male after coitus, but be
				<lb/>cause it symbolizes the female in general, who spreads nets for
				<lb/>the unwary male...(and whose) dangerous aspect is much en
				<lb/>hanced by the element of weaving..."1o
				<lb/>It is of interest to note that the supernatural being, Spider
				<lb/>Woman, taught the Navajo women to weave. The protecting
				<lb/>aspects of the spider are shown in the Vedic sacrament of
				<lb/>Nämakarana, name-giving, during which a spiderlike web of
				<lb/>scarlet-colored threads is woven around the newborn child as
				<lb/>a protection from evil. With similar intent, a special rite of
				<lb/>preservation is performed on expectant mothers which is
				<lb/>called Raksabandhana, “the Binding of the Protective
				<lb/>Thread to ward off the Evil Eye, illness and jealous spells."11
			</p>
			<pb n='66'/>
			<p>
				<lb/>In India, the three-day Upanayana, or Sacred Thread cere
				<lb/>mony, initiates the young male of the Brahmin and other
				<lb/>castes as a"twice-born” man. Now solely restricted to Hindu
				<lb/>males, the Upanayana was at one time an honor equally be
				<lb/>stowed upon girls as asymbol of regeneration. Duringthe in
				<lb/>vestiture with the sacred thread, a threefold cord which has
				<lb/>been spun by a Brahmin virgin is twisted three times and tied
				<lb/>with a triple knot. The duration of the rite and the knotting of
				<lb/>cords suggests an association with the triple lunar aspects of
				<lb/>the threefold goddess of birth: the personification of birth
				<lb/>life and death; the waxing, waning and full moon. The sacred
				<lb/>Indian thread may be likened to the umbilical cord that
				<lb/>nourishes the fetus in preparation for its eventual entry into
				<lb/>the world; for the rite of the “twice-born” marks the adoles
				<lb/>cent’s separation from the mother, and the beginning of
				<lb/>manhood.12
				<lb/>A parallel for the Indian custom may be found in ancient
				<lb/>Egypt, where knots of cloth inscribed with magic words of
				<lb/>power were worn as a protection against illness and harm.
				<lb/>In Egypt, Meskhenet ("birth place”) is the goddess who cuts
				<lb/>the umbilical cord; she wears a uterus headdress. As one of
				<lb/>the Seven Hathors, she pronounces the fate of children at
				<lb/>birth, and is the goddess of childbirth, death and rebirth. Ir
				<lb/>the rites of the dead she presides over the place of purifica
				<lb/>tion, or Meskhen, and “allows (the) soul to enter (the) body
				<lb/>reborn.26 Her name is given to the brick on which women
				<lb/>crouched in birth-giving position. In Arabic tradition, the
				<lb/>Lady Fatimah is the Weaver; the Muslim surahs, or prayers
				<lb/>against witchcraft, ask that the devoted be saved
				<lb/>"’from the evil of (women who) are blowers on knots." The
				<lb/>words ’blowers on knots’ refers to magicians. .. who recite in
				<lb/>cantations... intended to do harm. .. whilst they tie knots in a
				<lb/>string—in other words, weave spells."1
				<lb/>The highly venerated stone Omphalos of Delphi, the goddess
				<lb/>Caia’s sacred site, was believed to be the center, or navel of
				<lb/>the world. The iconic stone was thought to be the grave
				<lb/>mound of the sacred python of the Oracles, and was com
				<lb/>pletely covered with a woven net of fillets, or threads.1
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb/>As "the knot is a dire instrument of the enchantress,”15 it is
				<lb/>not surprising to see the knot as an emblem of the Great God
				<lb/>dess and her regenerative womb, and as a magical symbol of
				<lb/>her protection. The worship of the goddess Net, or Neith,
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb/>whosename may stem from the root netet, toknit, to weave,16
				<lb/>extends back to predynastic times (before 3400 B.c). In Egyp
				<lb/>tian texts Net is mentioned as a goddess ot protection, some
				<lb/>times represented by a hieroglyph whose meaning has been
				<lb/>interpreted as that of a magical knot.
				<lb/>"The Egyptian word... to express the meaning of ’protection'
				<lb/>is sa..., and the character represents a knot of a peculiar
				<lb/>kind."3
				<lb/>The Egyptian Ankh, the knotted sign of life, is a hieroglyphic
				<lb/>representation of the womb and a symbol of protection;1s
				<lb/>"It is probably more than a coincidence that in Coptic art the
				<lb/>Ankhsign often resembles the familiarsignfor Venus( Q )."19
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb/>Although little is known of the parthenogenic fish-goddess
				<lb/>Tanit, worshipped in Carthage from the fifth century B.C.
				<lb/>through early Christian times, she is represented by a geo
				<lb/>metric emblem, the Sign of Tanit, which closely resembles
				<lb/>the Ankh, or sign of life, the Sacred Knot of the Cretan
				<lb/>Mother Goddess, and other hieroglyphic symbols emblematic
				<lb/>of the womb and the protection it affords. The same repre
				<lb/>sentation occurs in the Tjet, or Knot of Isis, which is one of
				<lb/>the most common of Egyptian amulets, and an emblem of
				<lb/>the "uterus and vagina of lsis”:2° the goddess who was
				<lb/>known for her magical ability to restore the dead to life, and
				<lb/>who was acknowledged as having invented "the cultivation
				<lb/>of crops and the spinning of threads” in Egypt.21 As the
				<lb/>amulet of the Tjet was placed on the neck of the deceased,
				<lb/>an incantation from the Book of the Dead was recited over
				<lb/>"the blood of Isis, the virtue of Isis; the magic power of Isis,
				<lb/>the magic power of the Eye, are protecting this greatone."22
				<lb/>That the goddess of death also possesses the power to
				<lb/>resurrect is shown in "the oldest recorded account of the
				<lb/>passage through the gates of metamorphosis”23 in which
				<lb/>Inanna (Ishtar) descends to the netherworld where Dumuzi
				<lb/>remains as surrogate to die in her place. The vegetation god
				<lb/>dess returns to earth, as the embodiment of the grain-spirit
				<lb/>reborn. The swirling reed-bundle standard of the life-giving
				<lb/>Inanna is a form that
				<lb/>"exactly resembles the Minoan and Mycenaean emblem of
				<lb/>the goddess (and) combines the knot with the spiral entry of
				<lb/>birth."24
			</p>
			<pb n='67'/>
			<p>
				<lb/>The Minoan knot is none other than the Sacred Knot of
				<lb/>Ariadne which, with its prominent diamond-glyph pattern
				<lb/>ing emblematic of the womb, and the knotting together of
				<lb/>its threads into tassels, has associations with the "thread
				<lb/>of initiation” as the “Key of Life,” and the shamanistic cord
				<lb/>or rope as the path to consciousness.
				<lb/>In modern times, evidence of the initiatory thread or
				<lb/>knot may be observed among Christians in Syria who "bake
				<lb/>(knotted) rolls...to be eaten once a year on Easter morn
				<lb/>ing”2s thus equating the labyrinthine knot with the bread
				<lb/>of life and the resurrection of the soul. The braided Sab
				<lb/>bath-loaf, or Berchisbrod, of the German Jews evidently has
				<lb/>its origin in ancient goddess rites:
				<lb/>"The Teutonic goddess of fertility, Berchta, or Perchta, was
				<lb/>worshipped by the women with rites which included offering
				<lb/>their hair to her. In time this ceremony became obsolete and
				<lb/>was replaced by a symbolic offering of the hair in the shape
				<lb/>of a loaf representing intertwined braids...."26
				<lb/>Hebrew scholars have offered alternative suggestions as to
				<lb/>the derivation of the Berchisbrod, as for example, that the
				<lb/>name Berches' stems from the Old High German Berchit,
				<lb/>which also describes the loaf known as “Brezel."2 At all
				<lb/>events, the pretzel too is baked in the form of a lose triple
				<lb/>knot, and was probably, in early times, an offering made for
				<lb/>a festival in Berchta’s honor.
				<lb/>With few exceptions, the goddesses who spin and weave
				<lb/>are goddesses of childbirth, protectors of women, and deities
				<lb/>of war. Perhaps the most famous goddess of war and wis
				<lb/>dom is Athene who, in one of her numerous functions, was
				<lb/>the protectress of spinning and weaving. It is an awkward
				<lb/>function, evidently a remnant from earlier times, as Athene
				<lb/>is a foe of women and matriarchal ideals in classical Greece.
				<lb/>lhe Lydian princess Arachne, whose name means "spider
				<lb/>in Greek, is said to have hanged herself when the jealous
				<lb/>Athene destroyed her weaving which had not a single imper
				<lb/>fection. The myth relates that the vengeful goddess “turned
				<lb/>her into a spider— the insect she hates most— and the rope
				<lb/>into a cobweb. ..”2° The wise owl is among Athene’s most
				<lb/>sacred emblems, a bird with lunar associations that is gen
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb/>erally regarded as a creature of ill omen, and in German
				<lb/>tradition is represented as a nocturnal weaver:
				<lb/>"Even in a starless night, nothing is concealed; a morose old
				<lb/>owl lurks in her somber little chamber, spinning on a tiny sil
				<lb/>ver spindle, as she watches the evil in the darkness."29
				<lb/>In the Norse Eddas, the three golden-haired Valkyries
				<lb/>("Choosers of the Slain”) are magical swan-maidens who
				<lb/>spin on the shores of the lake as they sing their death chant
				<lb/>The weaving of the Greek Sirens, who also assume bird
				<lb/>shape in their earliest representations, is of a more abstract
				<lb/>nature. They are the "Entanglers," "those who bind with a
				<lb/>cord,” who lure with their eloquent song and promise knowl
				<lb/>edge whose attainment implies death, that is, spiritual initia
				<lb/>tion.
				<lb/>The Teutonic Frigg (Frigga) in her original form is a god
				<lb/>dess of love, knowledge, and justice who spins golden thread
				<lb/>and weaves the clouds in heaven. She was much reduced in
				<lb/>later folklore, but it should be remembered that the "demons
				<lb/>and bogeys are invariably the reduced gods or priests of a
				<lb/>superseded religion,"3° or, in this case, goddesses or priest
				<lb/>esses. Frigg(a)’s later counterpart in German lore is Holde,
				<lb/>Held, or Frau Holle, who
				<lb/>"appeared as an ugly old witch, with long, matted hair and
				<lb/>protruding teeth. In medieval Germany she had developed
				<lb/>into the demon-witch who gobbles up children. She was held
				<lb/>responsible for entangling hair at night. ’er ist mit Holle ge
				<lb/>fahren“* was said of one whose hair was disheveled and
				<lb/>knotted."3
				<lb/>It is the same Held, the thirteenth wise woman in the tale of
				<lb/>Sleeping Beauty, who is excluded from the princess’s birth
				<lb/>day celebration because there are only twelve golden plates
				<lb/>in the palace, and so she curses Sleeping Beauty with death
				<lb/>The princess finds the old wise woman spinning in a tower,
				<lb/>and it is her spindle that pricks the girl’s finger and causes
				<lb/>her to sleep for one hundred years.
				<lb/>In the lunar calendar there are thirteen months, the thir
				<lb/>teenth being "the death-month, ruled over by the three
				<lb/>Fates, or Spinners."32 The Greek Spinners of Fate, or “Moirai,
				<lb/>whose name derives from the root meaning "to die,"33 are
			</p>
			<pb n='68'/>
			<p>
				<lb/>named Clotho ("spinner”), who spins the thread of life;
				<lb/>Lachesis ("measure”), who measures the length of the thread;
				<lb/>and Atropos ("she who cannot be avoided”), who cuts the
				<lb/>thread at its determined time. As the deciders of destiny,
				<lb/>these parthenogenous daughters of the goddess Necessity
				<lb/>form a greatly feared lunar triad, for:
				<lb/>"when the Moirai exert their power upon men, it is first and
				<lb/>foremost as warriors, forwhom theyweave a bloody death..."34
				<lb/>Eileithyia ("She who has caused to come”) is the leading
				<lb/>figure in another triad of Greek goddesses of childbirth; the
				<lb/>others are Artemis and Hera, both of whom have the spindle
				<lb/>as their emblem. In the Delian hymn sung at her altar, she is
				<lb/>Eileithyia Eulinos ("with the goodly thread"), a goddess of
				<lb/>destiny whose sacred emblem is the cord. She is a magician
				<lb/>and sorceress who when she held her knees together
				<lb/>clasped her hands with crossed fingers and muttered charms
				<lb/>could postpone labor at will. The images in her many
				<lb/>shrines always showed her veiled, and in places "she was
				<lb/>regarded with such sanctity that only her priestesses were
				<lb/>permitted to see herimage."3
				<lb/>To be veiled means "to weave,” from the same Anglo
				<lb/>Saxon root as "witch,” (wiccian, to use as sorcery); and:
				<lb/>"...to weave is the restricted form of to work. ..to perform
				<lb/>a sacred action. In all the actions, the goddess is the Maya,
				<lb/>the greatweaver of life."36 The Indian concept of the woven
				<lb/>veil of Maya, or Illusion, is undoubtedly related to the idea
				<lb/>of woman as the eternal weaver of webs. At Catal Huyuk, a
				<lb/>pregnant goddess reveals herself to her worshippers, open
				<lb/>ing her veil-like garment, richly patterned in an elaborate
				<lb/>net-like diamond glyph design, the Syrian goddess of fer
				<lb/>tility discloses her sacred mysteries in the same attitude
				<lb/>some five thousand years later (c. 1000 B.c.). Isis, the great
				<lb/>enchantress, is veiled; so too Neith, who
				<lb/>"was the personification of the eternal female principle of
				<lb/>life which was self-sustaining and self-existent, and was
				<lb/>secret, and unknown, and all-pervading. .. the prototype of
				<lb/>partheno-genesis."3
				<lb/>Penelope ("with a web over her face”) eluded her many
				<lb/>suitors by secretly unravelling at night the weaving she had
				<lb/>done by day. In ancient China, where the female Weaver
				<lb/>was a stellar divinity, a bride was required to be veiled dur
				<lb/>ing the marriage celebrations and rites of betrothal and mar
				<lb/>riage took place only in the hours of twilight.
				<lb/>The aura of mystery that surrounds the riddle may be
				<lb/>likened to the veil that shrouds the Goddess in her vast wis
				<lb/>dom. The Sphinx, meaning literally, “the Strangler,” who is
				<lb/>represented as a hybrid animal with female head and breasts,
				<lb/>is a symbol of this hidden wisdom. The riddle she posed to
				<lb/>the inhabitants of Thebes was in the nature of a highly sacred
				<lb/>initiatory ordeal and all who failed to unravel her mysteries
				<lb/>were strangled on the spot. When Oedipus solved the enig
				<lb/>ma, thereby becoming king through matrilineal descent, the
				<lb/>age-old matriarchal Sphinx committed suicide. But Oedipus’
				<lb/>eminent downfall is history.
				<lb/>In the Old Testament, the Queen of Sheba, who was
				<lb/>versed in the magic arts, presented questions of a similar
				<lb/>initiatory character to test the wisdom of Solomon, and
				<lb/>literature and myth document that the revelations of the
				<lb/>Delphic Oracle were couched in enigmatic form. The Cor
				<lb/>dian Knot, perhaps the most famous symbol of knowledge
				<lb/>in history, was meant to be untied, as the message formed
				<lb/>by each of its knotted runes was the name of a sacred god
				<lb/>dess; a riddle to be solved through superior spiritual con
				<lb/>sciousness. Alexander ("defender of men”) failed to solve
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb/>the problem it posed, and, as he "had not the learning, pa
				<lb/>tience or ingenuity to perform the task decently, used his
				<lb/>sword."3° By sheer brute force he, with many others, brought
				<lb/>the ideals of mother-right to an end; and yet the veil re
				<lb/>mained untouched. Alexander was poisoned by an unknown
				<lb/>hand at the age of thirty-three.
				<lb/>An ancient inscription, which refers to Pallas Athene, but
				<lb/>is attributed to Neith, reads:
				<lb/>"I am everything which hath been, and which is, and which
				<lb/>shall be, and there hath never been any who hath uncovered
				<lb/>(or revealed) my veil."39
				<lb/>Throughout the world, the Great Goddess "weaves the web
				<lb/>of life and spins the threads of fate”;“ in her hands rests the
				<lb/>destiny of each individual, her shimmering veil concealing
				<lb/>the mysteries of the universe to the uninitiated.

				<lb/>1am sleeping in my bed in a small town in north

				<lb/>can see that it is a large and sleeping goddess. As she

				<lb/>she’s sensitive here. I am fascinated with how beau
				<lb/>tiful she is! Catherine’s vagina opens wider! She can
				<lb/>open herself so wide because she has given birth
				<lb/>to me! Now the sun is streaming into her and I can
				<lb/>see her cervix and the interior of her womb. Beauti
				<lb/>ful pinks, sun glow, brilliant reds. I say, "You are like

				<lb/>with my fears.
				<lb/>In the basement of a public building—a tem
				<lb/>porarily safe place—Kit and I meet a Black wom
				<lb/>an and man. They are revolutionaries, wanted for
				<lb/>their political activities. The woman is solid, warm,
				<lb/>serious. I feel unsure. The woman asks, Are you
				<lb/>willing to deal with the risks of your outlook?" She
				<lb/>shows us the compact gun she carries inside her
				<lb/>thigh and the arrow slung diagonally across her
				<lb/>back. I am frightened by the gun, intrigued by the
				<lb/>arrow. We have been here long enough. As we get

				<lb/>they walk aroud in a circle on their lawn in a very

				<lb/>The Reemergence of the Archetype of the Great
				<lb/>Goddess in Art by Contemporary Women
				<lb/>Gloria Feman Orenstein
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb/>As the archetype of the Great God
				<lb/>dess reemerges into consciousness
				<lb/>today, women artists, through trans
				<lb/>personal visionary experiences, are
				<lb/>bringing to light energic psychic
				<lb/>forces, symbols, images, artifacts and
				<lb/>rituals whose configurations con
				<lb/>stitute the basic paradigm of a new
				<lb/>feminist myth for our time.
				<lb/>When a psychological need arises i
				<lb/>seems inevitably the deeper layers of
				<lb/>the collective unconscious are acti
				<lb/>vated and sooner or later the memory of
				<lb/>a myth of an event or an earlier psychic
				<lb/>state emerges into consciousness.
				<lb/>Evoking the memory of an earlien
				<lb/>psychic state, one in which divinity
				<lb/>was seen to reside in matter and the
				<lb/>energies of the earth were revered as
				<lb/>sacred, the Goddess has become that
				<lb/>symbol of transformation which
				<lb/>activates those forces within woman
				<lb/>identified with holiness and with cre
				<lb/>ative power. If the artist is the avatar
				<lb/>of the new age, the alchemist whose
				<lb/>great Art is the transformation of con
				<lb/>sciousness and being, then contem
				<lb/>porary women artists such as Mary
				<lb/>Beth Edelson, Carolee Schneemann,
				<lb/>Mimi Lobell, Buffie Johnson, Judy
				<lb/>Chicago, Donna Byars, Donna Henes,
				<lb/>Miriam Sharon, Ana Mendieta, Betsy
				<lb/>Damon, Betye Saar, Monica Sjoo and
				<lb/>Hannah Kay, by summoning up the
				<lb/>powers associated with the Goddess
				<lb/>archetype, are energizing a new forn
				<lb/>of Goddess consciousness, which, in
				<lb/>its most recent manifestation is ex
				<lb/>orcising the patriarchal creation myth
				<lb/>through a repossession of the female
				<lb/>visionary faculties.
				<lb/>This new Goddess consciousness
				<lb/>might be described most effectively as
				<lb/>a holistic mind-body totality. As we
				<lb/>move away from the cultural dom
				<lb/>inance of the masculine archetype
				<lb/>characterized by a mind-body duality,
				<lb/>we find that the model of the sor
				<lb/>cerer’s vision serves as a corrective
				<lb/>alternative for a consciousness expan
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb/>sion in which intuitive body-knowl-
				<lb/>edge is reaffirmed as a faculty of intel
				<lb/>ligence. Transcending the false du
				<lb/>alities and dichotomies established by
				<lb/>patriarchal systems of thought which
				<lb/>split mind from body, spirit from mat
				<lb/>ter and sacred from profane, the Great
				<lb/>Goddess as a psychic symbol suggests
				<lb/>the rebirth of woman to a holistic
				<lb/>psychophysical perception of the
				<lb/>sacred, as a new form of her feminist
				<lb/>evolution.
				<lb/>Artists who are in touch with the
				<lb/>archetype of the Goddess are now us
				<lb/>ing the female form in both image and
				<lb/>ritual as an instrument of spirit-knowl
				<lb/>edge. They are training the body so
				<lb/>that it functions as a conscious per
				<lb/>ceptor and transformer of the power
				<lb/>ful energies that reside in matter, both
				<lb/>animal and vegetable. Through the
				<lb/>psychophysical participation in Edel
				<lb/>son’s magical ceremonies of evoca
				<lb/>tion, through the transformation of
				<lb/>the body into a living totem in
				<lb/>Damon’s rituals, through the stimula
				<lb/>tion of the body via meditation upon
				<lb/>the power points in the body icons of
				<lb/>Kurz’s self-portrait as the Durga, or
				<lb/>Mailman's mirror image as God,
				<lb/>through the fusion of the body with
				<lb/>the earth itself in Mendieta’s alchem
				<lb/>ical burials, through the sacrilization
				<lb/>of the body in Lobell's Goddess Tem
				<lb/>ple, and through a merging with the
				<lb/>spirit of the Goddess in Suzanne Ben
				<lb/>ton’s masked ritual theater, women
				<lb/>are gradually repossessing the powers
				<lb/>long associated with the various man
				<lb/>ifestations of the archetype of the
				<lb/>Goddess.
				<lb/>This new art (in which the arche
				<lb/>type of the Goddess plays a catalytic
				<lb/>role) is not based upon an original
				<lb/>creation myth connected with the fer
				<lb/>tiity and birth mysteries. In its modern
				<lb/>transformed meaning, it is about the
				<lb/>mysteries of woman’s rebirth from
				<lb/>the womb of historical darkness, in
				<lb/>which her powers were so long en
				<lb/>shrouded, into a new era where a cul-
				<lb/>ture of her own making will come
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb/>about as a result of a new Earth
				<lb/>Alchemy.
				<lb/>If the alchemy performed by the
				<lb/>male magician sought essentially to
				<lb/>purify brute matter by transforming it
				<lb/>into spirit, taking gold or the philos
				<lb/>opher’s stone as the symbol of spir
				<lb/>itual enlightenment, the supreme goal
				<lb/>of alchemy for women artists today is
				<lb/>to restore the spirit already inherent in
				<lb/>the natural world; to consider matter
				<lb/>itself as a storehouse of the potent
				<lb/>energies most available for transfor
				<lb/>mations in their natural organic state
				<lb/>Women are attempting nothing less
				<lb/>than the magical dealchemizing of
				<lb/>the philosopher’s stone, the recon
				<lb/>stitution of the Earth Goddess’s origi
				<lb/>nal herborium on the planet and the
				<lb/>energizing of the self through the
				<lb/>internalization of its sacred spirits. It
				<lb/>is no mere coincidence that the al
				<lb/>chemical symbols of “witchcraft,” the
				<lb/>magic of the wise women who wor-
				<lb/>shipped the Goddess, are herbs,
				<lb/>grains, plants and seeds. The desire to
				<lb/>alter both mental and physical func
				<lb/>tioning translates an impulse to in
				<lb/>tegrate the Earth Goddess’s chemica
				<lb/>secrets into the body and to carry the
				<lb/>Goddess within the self. In so doing,
				<lb/>women now activate a Goddess con
				<lb/>sciousness within matter by means of
				<lb/>which all contemporary culture will
				<lb/>be awakened
				<lb/>Jung said: "To carry a god around in
				<lb/>yourself is a guarantee of happiness
				<lb/>of power, and even of omnipotence in
				<lb/>so far as these are attributes of divin
				<lb/>ity."2
				<lb/>Contemporary woman's need to
				<lb/>carry a "god" around within the self
				<lb/>her desire to transform herself into the
				<lb/>image of the Goddess, arises from a
				<lb/>deep historical imperative. Research
				<lb/>into the history of Goddess worship
				<lb/>gives ample evidence of the desecra
				<lb/>tion of Goddess temples, shrines,
				<lb/>altars and sanctuaries, and of the sys
				<lb/>tematic erasure of all traces of God
				<lb/>dess worship from the face of the
				<lb/>earth. Through the persecution of
			</p>
			<pb n='75'/>
			<p>
				<lb/>witches, sacred knowledge of the Old
				<lb/>Religion had to be transmitted through
				<lb/>visual and oral lore from generation to
				<lb/>generation. Where once the Goddess
				<lb/>was worshipped at sacred natural sites
				<lb/>with the Earth identified as the body
				<lb/>of the Great Mother, today women
				<lb/>are transforming their own bodies into
				<lb/>those sacred repositories of Goddess
				<lb/>knowledge and energy
				<lb/>The repossession by woman of the
				<lb/>attributes of the Great Goddess is
				<lb/>necessary in order to provide fun
				<lb/>damental changes in vision and re
				<lb/>ality. Under the hegemony of patri
				<lb/>archal religions, notably Christianity,
				<lb/>which has conditioned Western con
				<lb/>sciousness over many centuries
				<lb/>through image-making and ritual, a
				<lb/>profound mystification has been per
				<lb/>petrated on so large a scale that one
				<lb/>of the first functions of this new art is
				<lb/>to exorcise the sexist impact and in
				<lb/>terpretation of all sacred imagery.
				<lb/>Christian art, for example, by estab
				<lb/>lishing the paradoxical image of the
				<lb/>Virgin Mother, has encouraged wom
				<lb/>en to hallucinate an impossibility as if
				<lb/>it were a natural image of reality. In
				<lb/>order to reestablish the validity of the
				<lb/>natural image of Mother and Child as
				<lb/>incorporated in the archetype of the
				<lb/>Fertility Goddess, contemporary
				<lb/>artists are celebrating sexuality by in
				<lb/>voking ancient images of the Great
				<lb/>Mother that exalt procreation and
				<lb/>superimposing them over the former
				<lb/>image of the Virgin and Child.
				<lb/>Another integral part of the process
				<lb/>of Goddess-culture art are the expedi
				<lb/>tions to caves, mounds, sanctuaries
				<lb/>shrines or megalithic sites in search of
				<lb/>the energy evoked and the artifacts or
				<lb/>symbols of veneration left by ancient
				<lb/>cults which worshipped the Goddess.
				<lb/>In this kind of search artists are mak
				<lb/>ing the heretofore invisible, manifest
				<lb/>again. This visionary technique of
				<lb/>rendering the invisible and the real
				<lb/>visible once more and ultimately
				<lb/>abolishing the separation between the
				<lb/>spiritual and the material plane rees
				<lb/>tablishes the human and the natural
				<lb/>as the legitimate realm of the divine.
				<lb/>The energy formerly required to ac
				<lb/>cept Christian illusion is now released
				<lb/>for the accomplishment of the true
				<lb/>work of alchemical transformation
				<lb/>that of preparing and retraining the
				<lb/>mind-body perceptor so that womer
				<lb/>may now perform their highest
				<lb/>functions.
				<lb/>This exaltation of natural energies
				<lb/>releases enormous potential so that
				<lb/>women may begin to transform them
				<lb/>selves into living repositories of
				<lb/>sacred knowledge, storing their total
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb/>history within their bodies, their
				<lb/>psychic memory and their art as a
				<lb/>natural form of protection against
				<lb/>future persecution or annihilation. As
				<lb/>bearers of sacred tradition, contem
				<lb/>porary feminist artists use ritual to re
				<lb/>sacrilize the female body, creating a
				<lb/>new sacred space for the enactment
				<lb/>of those magical rebirth ceremónies
				<lb/>that are first coming into our culture
				<lb/>through art.
				<lb/>In Beyond Cod the Father, Mary
				<lb/>Daly, redefining God as a verb, as a
				<lb/>participation in being, rather than
				<lb/>anthropomorphically as a being, sug
				<lb/>gests that women’s participation in
				<lb/>history, her new sisterhood, is a
				<lb/>means of saying "us vs. nonbeing.
				<lb/>What we are about is the human be
				<lb/>coming of that half of the human race
				<lb/>that has been excluded from humanity
				<lb/>by sexual definition.. What is at stake
				<lb/>is a real leap in human evolution, in
				<lb/>itiated by women.
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb/>The Goddess, then, is that arche
				<lb/>type which mediates between image,
				<lb/>energy and history, evolving and un
				<lb/>folding destiny through the redirec
				<lb/>tion of energy into a revolutionary
				<lb/>manifestation of being. When imaged
				<lb/>and celebrated in contemporary art,
				<lb/>the Goddess signifies Being as a verb,
				<lb/>as a creative energy, as a transfor
				<lb/>mative energy, as sacred earth-energy
				<lb/>and as psychic energy. Contemporary
				<lb/>women artists are using the documen
				<lb/>tation that is being gathered on the
				<lb/>various manifestations of the Goddess
				<lb/>from the Upper Paleolithic and Neo
				<lb/>lithic communities to the present both
				<lb/>as visual and as informational data, as
				<lb/>elements of the new art works or
				<lb/>events they are creating in accordance
				<lb/>with the elaboration of a new myth
				<lb/>synonymous with the exigencies of
				<lb/>female culture in the 1970s
				<lb/>Architect Mimi Lobell and two
				<lb/>other women, one a Jungian, have de
			</p>
			<pb n='76'/>
			<p>
				<lb/>signed a Goddess Temple which ex
				<lb/>presses the theme of initiation and
				<lb/>rebirth into a Goddess-centered cul
				<lb/>ture. They consider the temple to be
				<lb/>the externalization of an archetypal
				<lb/>structure that exists within the psy
				<lb/>che. The temple, whose eventual site
				<lb/>will be a mountainous region near
				<lb/>Aspen, Colorado, is conceived as an
				<lb/>alogous to the body of the Goddess
				<lb/>through which the initiate will pass in
				<lb/>a ceremony of transformation. Its
				<lb/>form and materials function as a
				<lb/>catalyst for this process. According to
				<lb/>Lobell, "To go through the temple will
				<lb/>be to experience an initiation into the
				<lb/>mysteries of the feminine and activate
				<lb/>a prelogical consciousness."“
				<lb/>As planned, the temple is ap
				<lb/>proached via an uphill walk along a
				<lb/>"sacred way" lined with figures of
				<lb/>animals. The entrance is at the lower
				<lb/>level, which appears to be buried in
				<lb/>rock. Deep in this rock the veiled
				<lb/>entry leads to a nine-ring labyrinth.
				<lb/>Reversing the process of birth one
				<lb/>enters through the vaginal orifice and
				<lb/>journeys toward the third eye of en
				<lb/>lightenment. The walls of the labyrinth
				<lb/>are covered with exotic fabrics and
				<lb/>tapestries, weavings, batiks, silks and
				<lb/>lace from various ethnic sources. In
				<lb/>the center of the labyrinth lies the
				<lb/>sunken grail pool, inscribed with a
				<lb/>serpentine spiral. A helical ladder, 15
				<lb/>feet high, rises out of the pool and
				<lb/>ascends to the upper temple, which at
				<lb/>eye level becomes a 360-degree open
				<lb/>windowed panorama of the moun
				<lb/>tains and valleys. Over the windows
				<lb/>are 29 perforations in the shape of the
				<lb/>moon, one for each of its monthly day
				<lb/>cycle. The altar is a part of the Great
				<lb/>Eye of Vision of the Eye Goddess.
				<lb/>We are one with that all receptive 360
				<lb/>degree panoramic perception in the
				<lb/>Oculus of the Eye Goddess, warmed by
				<lb/>the fires of Vesta, the libidinous energy
				<lb/>that keeps us integrated with our bodies
				<lb/>and with all of our sensuous lenses onto
				<lb/>the mysteries of the universe. The water
				<lb/>of the hydolunar force has been trans
				<lb/>muted into the fire that ignites the fem
				<lb/>inine wisdom of Sophia and the Muses
				<lb/>and the Oracles and Sybils.
				<lb/>Becoming conscious of the pres
				<lb/>ence of Goddess imagery in one's
				<lb/>work is a long arduous process of
				<lb/>visual reeducation. Carolee Schnee
				<lb/>mann, who in childhood saw the
				<lb/>radiant face of the Great Mother in
				<lb/>the moon and believed that the world
				<lb/>was permeated by invisible energies
				<lb/>unconsciously made her first Goddess
				<lb/>image in 1963 when she was working
				<lb/>on her theater piece Chromolodeon.
				<lb/>In her desire for a companion figure
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb/>for the piece, she made the head of a
				<lb/>horned bull and mounted it on a
				<lb/>clothed dressmaker’s dummy. Seven
				<lb/>years later she was to discover that the
				<lb/>bull was the sacred beast of the Great
				<lb/>Goddess. In the 1960s Schneemann
				<lb/>did not yet understand the real signif
				<lb/>icance of the bull iconography in her
				<lb/>work. In her series of body pieces
				<lb/>such as Meat Joy of 1964, she began
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb/>to put the materials from the static
				<lb/>works onto herself, and in Eye Body
				<lb/>(1963) she used two snakes on her
				<lb/>body in a set of transformative ac
				<lb/>tions. Later, reviewing her artistic
				<lb/>evolution through the 1970’s, Schnee
				<lb/>mann came to understand that the
				<lb/>serpents in her earlier works were re
				<lb/>lated to the Minoan Snake Goddess
				<lb/>through a series of iconographica
				<lb/>similarities and personal connections
				<lb/>The figure of the Minoan Snake
				<lb/>Goddess, arms upright, is currently
				<lb/>featured in much Goddess-culture art
				<lb/>This merging of the self with that of
				<lb/>the Goddess functions as a mirror
				<lb/>reflection in which women see them
				<lb/>selves as the Goddess and the God
				<lb/>dess in themselves.
				<lb/>The process of the evolution of
				<lb/>Goddess consciousness itself became
				<lb/>the theme of Homerunmuse (per
				<lb/>formed at the Brooklyn Museum dur
				<lb/>ing the Women Artists 1550-1950
				<lb/>show, Fall 1977). In a meditation
				<lb/>upon the female and the muse, whose
				<lb/>presence is indicated in the word
				<lb/>"museum," but whose usual absence
				<lb/>from the institution was made ob
				<lb/>vious by the fact of the women artists'
			</p>
			<pb n='77'/>
			<p>
				<lb/>show, Schneemann rejects “the ab
				<lb/>stracted token Muse as fragmenta
				<lb/>tion. Through a collage of texts
				<lb/>Schneemann reiterates the theme of
				<lb/>woman remaking herself into the
				<lb/>image of the Goddess.
				<lb/>Israeli artist Miriam Sharon per
				<lb/>forms desert rituals that are rites of
				<lb/>exorcism overthrowing the patriarchal
				<lb/>model that constructed alienating
				<lb/>cityscapes of concrete over the an
				<lb/>cient earth shrines and sacred sites.
				<lb/>Her pilgrimage to the desert put her in
				<lb/>contact with the Bedouins, “the last
				<lb/>survivors of the Earth Living Culture."
				<lb/>Her own Space Project-Earth People
				<lb/>which grew out of her stay in the
				<lb/>desert is a ritual act of identification
				<lb/>with the Earth Culture. Through med
				<lb/>itation rituals in the wilderness,
				<lb/>Sharon expresses the wish to recreate
				<lb/>an ancient lost myth of the Earth.
				<lb/>Sharon’s reclamation of the barren
				<lb/>earth as the natural holy shrine and
				<lb/>her use of the desert as a temple for
				<lb/>meditation exemplify the return to
				<lb/>primal matter as holy matter. Her par
				<lb/>ticipation with the Bedouins in the life
				<lb/>of the desert as Goddess-space paral
				<lb/>lels the initiatory experience of
				<lb/>Lobell’s Goddess Temple. However,
				<lb/>Sharon defines “holy” as without
				<lb/>shrines or temples, holy in its being
				<lb/>only.
				<lb/>The Bedouins (whom I adopted some
				<lb/>years ago as part of my work) are part
				<lb/>of this “meditative” existence of the
				<lb/>desert. They meditate daily in front of
				<lb/>the wide seas or wide wilderness of the
				<lb/>desert. They kiss the earth for their
				<lb/>existence. They never thanked their
				<lb/>"god" by building huge temples, but
				<lb/>just kissed the sands. When they will
				<lb/>disappear they will never leave behind
				<lb/>any traces for their existence, except
				<lb/>the stones of their burial places. I try
				<lb/>through my art, not to build static
				<lb/>sculptures or monuments in the spaces
				<lb/>but only put human energy through my
				<lb/>art (a ritual art) into something that is
				<lb/>disappearing.
				<lb/>Sharon’s recent Sand Tent Project
				<lb/>involved the participation of a Bed
				<lb/>ouin tribe and a Kibbutz settlement
				<lb/>(Kerem Shalom). The Bedouin Mother
				<lb/>who taught her how to create such a
				<lb/>tent is the last survivor of the tent life
				<lb/>in that area. Sharon’s apprenticeship
				<lb/>to the wise women who know the
				<lb/>secrets of the earth is an affirmation
				<lb/>of woman as Goddess-incarnation.
				<lb/>The desert, for Sharon, symbolizes
				<lb/>patriarchal spiritual values (the barren
				<lb/>emptiness) which must be exorcised
				<lb/>and is, at the same time, that pure
				<lb/>clear space of the new frontier, repre
				<lb/>senting the new female space of
				<lb/>herstory upon which our lost traces
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb/>will be reinscribed and our new destiny
				<lb/>will be written.
				<lb/>Ana Mendieta, who came to the
				<lb/>U.S. from Cuba in 1961, thinks of the
				<lb/>Earth as the Goddess. She recalls a
				<lb/>mountain in Cuba, La Mazapan de
				<lb/>Matanza, that is in the shape of a re
				<lb/>clining woman. Her transformational
				<lb/>rituals explore the boundaries be
				<lb/>tween spirit and matter. In a piece
				<lb/>she did in a labyrinth, Silueta de
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb/>Laberinto (1974), she worked with the
				<lb/>metamorphosis of the self that occurs
				<lb/>in sorcery and trance. In this piece
				<lb/>someone traced her silhouette on the
				<lb/>ground. When Mendieta left the laby
				<lb/>rinth, her image was imprinted upon
				<lb/>the earth, suggesting that through a
				<lb/>merging with the Goddess spirits are
				<lb/>evoked that infuse the body and cause
				<lb/>such occurrences as out-of-body
				<lb/>journeys or astral travel. In Earth

			<p>
				<lb/>Sorcery, of which all her works are
				<lb/>examples, the Earth Goddess is the
				<lb/>shaman and the spell is invoked
				<lb/>through a magical rite in which
				<lb/>unification with the Earth Mother
				<lb/>transpires. Mendieta is concerned
				<lb/>with rebirth and her grave and buria
				<lb/>mound pieces suggest that material
				<lb/>death does not imply spiritual death
				<lb/>In some of her works, Mendieta
				<lb/>wraps herself in black cloth, imposing
				<lb/>her mummified form upon the ground
				<lb/>which is then dug out around her. A
				<lb/>series of these imprints are eventually
				<lb/>lit with gun powder, leaving silhou
				<lb/>etted after-images embedded in the
				<lb/>earth as a testimony to the magical
				<lb/>site of transformation, the dwelling of
				<lb/>the Goddess, where the human and
				<lb/>the divine had come to mingle as
				<lb/>preparation for a new destiny. Her art
				<lb/>concretizes that process of Earth
				<lb/>Alchemy, using prime matter itself as
				<lb/>the alchemistic vessel through which
				<lb/>spirit will be made to reenter matter
				<lb/>and transform woman into the vital
				<lb/>incarnation of the Earth Goddess once

				<lb/>Buffie Johnson’s paintings celebrate
				<lb/>the natural symbols of the universe
				<lb/>which were recognized as sacred in
				<lb/>the worship of the Great Goddess. The
				<lb/>plant and animal manifestations of
				<lb/>the Goddess are energizers of trans
				<lb/>formation which function like the star
				<lb/>and cross in the Judeo-Christian tradi
				<lb/>tion. They are reminders of the nu
				<lb/>minous state in which all of nature
				<lb/>was held to be sacred. Erich Neumann
				<lb/>writes:
				<lb/>Because originally human life was so
				<lb/>strongly affected by its participation
				<lb/>mystique with the outside world that
				<lb/>stone, plant, and man [sic.], animal
				<lb/>and star were bound together in asingle
				<lb/>stream, one could always transtorm
				<lb/>itself into another.
				<lb/>These symbols reinforce in us an
				<lb/>awareness that we are all manifesta
				<lb/>tions of the one "single stream, the
				<lb/>spirit of the Mother Goddess.
				<lb/>The general "theme" of Johnson's
				<lb/>work since the late 1940s is drawn
				<lb/>from the Jungian concept of the col
				<lb/>lective unconscious and from her
				<lb/>scholarly research on the Great God
				<lb/>dess. The paintings which evolved
				<lb/>with specific reference to the Goddess
				<lb/>show her aspects as Mistress of the
				<lb/>Beasts and Lady of the Plants. Around
				<lb/>the latter, she has created single
				<lb/>image plants in varying aspects of
				<lb/>cyclical transformation, which stim
				<lb/>ulate the unconscious and evoke
				<lb/>mythic memories. The paintings serve
				<lb/>as sacred icons to resurrect the layers
				<lb/>of consciousness in which our most
			</p>
			<pb n='79'/>
			<p>
				<lb/>primordial images, those of the Great
				<lb/>Goddess and of our true origin, lie
				<lb/>buried. In Ariadne ("Barley Mother,
				<lb/>1971), the Goddess of Vegetation is
				<lb/>evoked by the image of the long-grain
				<lb/>barley flowing gently down in a skirt
				<lb/>of rain. A pomegranate bursting from
				<lb/>within (Pomegranate, 1972) recalls
				<lb/>the myth of Persephone and Demeter
				<lb/>and their connection with the life
				<lb/>giving powers of the Feminine. The
				<lb/>monolithic opium seed-pod Lapis
				<lb/>(1970) is a cosmic starglobe exploding
				<lb/>with life, a metaphor for the Goddess
				<lb/>from whose womb all is born. In
				<lb/>Pasiphae (1976) the image of the iris,
				<lb/>the sacred lily of Crete, merges with
				<lb/>that of a bovine head, so that both
				<lb/>animal and plant symbols of the God
				<lb/>dess coalesce in a new charged sign.
				<lb/>References to the myth of the Min
				<lb/>otaur and the labyrinth are suggested;
				<lb/>the labyrinth of the Goddess being the
				<lb/>place where one loses and finds one
				<lb/>self again—the unconscious. The col
				<lb/>lective symbols are here employed as
				<lb/>forces of awakening, the artist reach
				<lb/>ing deep into the buried past when the
				<lb/>Goddess and all of nature were re
				<lb/>vealed as One.
				<lb/>Donna Byar’s work shows the cre-
				<lb/>ative processes at work in the de
				<lb/>ciphering of the oracle of the Goddess
				<lb/>as She speaks to the artist through the
				<lb/>labyrinth of dream and visionary ex
				<lb/>perience. Oracle Stone Crove, for ex
				<lb/>ample, evolved from a dream.
				<lb/>A stone woman who sat in a grove of
				<lb/>trees spoke to me in vapors, not words.
				<lb/>She was very poetic and mystical and
				<lb/>spoke only in truths. All of a sudden, like
				<lb/>in a faint, she slid from her chair into a
				<lb/>hole in the underground. I grabbed her
				<lb/>before she went underground and when
				<lb/>she came up she was no longer able to
				<lb/>speak. I woke up with a terrible feeling
				<lb/>of sadness.
				<lb/>In the piece itself, “All the com
				<lb/>ponents. .. sit on the floor and do not
				<lb/>occupy any wall space, two stones are
				<lb/>arranged perpendicular to each othe
				<lb/>sitting on an old paint scratched
				<lb/>rocker in a grove of four weeping fig
				<lb/>trees. For Byars, the Grove becomes a
				<lb/>shrine.
				<lb/>In works such as Vested Relic where
				<lb/>stone and silver wings are enclosed
				<lb/>within a blindfolded cage, creating a
				<lb/>secret altar and a reliquary, Byars pre
				<lb/>serves the magical objects that reveal
				<lb/>to her the presence of the Goddess as
				<lb/>a guardian spirit in her world. The
				<lb/>blindfolding of the cage symbolizes
				<lb/>that these sacred objects can only be
				<lb/>perceived with the inner eye. Byar's
				<lb/>glass collages make visible the appari
				<lb/>tions of the Mother Goddess in images
			</p>
			<pb n='80'/>
			<p>
				<lb/>of a winged being and a shaman, who
				<lb/>appears to us during altered states of
				<lb/>consciousness.
				<lb/>For Byars, the world is vibrant and
				<lb/>alive with signs and guideposts. Many
				<lb/>of her pieces are themselves omens
				<lb/>assembled from objects and materials
				<lb/>which spoke to her in oracular modes
				<lb/>One such object is Swathe, which
				<lb/>combines feathers and a wing on a
				<lb/>swathed ironing board that has lilies
				<lb/>of the valley wrapped in chamois
				<lb/>placed upon it. These totems and
				<lb/>talismans conjure up archaic imagery
				<lb/>from the distant past. Animal horns,
				<lb/>wings, feathers, shells, trees, serpents,
				<lb/>brought together in these mytho
				<lb/>poetic assemblages, activate intimate
				<lb/>relationships between natural mate
				<lb/>rials, objects and living things that il
				<lb/>luminate essences which were former
				<lb/>ly only visible to seers and shamans.
				<lb/>The presence of the Goddess is thus
				<lb/>revealed and brought into contem
				<lb/>porary consciousness.
				<lb/>Mary Beth Edelson’s work has long
				<lb/>been intimately involved in the ex
				<lb/>plorations of the Goddess. In 1961 her
				<lb/>painting of Madonna and Child en
				<lb/>titled Codhead introduced concentric
				<lb/>circles as sources of energy from the
				<lb/>Madonna’s head. In these early paint
				<lb/>ings? her women were frequently de
				<lb/>picted with their arms uplifted, rem
				<lb/>iniscent of the posture of many early
				<lb/>Goddess figures. The primal image of
				<lb/>the outstretched arms of the ancient
				<lb/>Goddess, whose power must be re
				<lb/>claimed by women for themselves to
				<lb/>day, is seen by Edelson not only as a
				<lb/>spiritual signifier, but as a contem
				<lb/>porary symbol of our political ac
				<lb/>tivism.
				<lb/>In 1969 she began to evolve a more
				<lb/>defined and specific area of arche
				<lb/>typal imagery, out of which emerged
				<lb/>the exhibition Woman Rising, revolu
				<lb/>tionary in the way it brought to con
				<lb/>sciousness psychic material about the
				<lb/>Great Goddess. Her most innovative
				<lb/>images for today have been the body
				<lb/>images she has created through per
				<lb/>forming private body rituals where the
				<lb/>body itself is the house of wisdom. In
				<lb/>these, the artist calls upon Goddess
				<lb/>energy, using her own body as a
				<lb/>stand-in for the Goddess and as a
				<lb/>symbol for Everywoman, whose ex
				<lb/>panded states of body-consciousness
				<lb/>and multiple transformations are
				<lb/>evoked through contact with powerful
				<lb/>natural energies.
				<lb/>1977, Edelson per
				<lb/>On March 1,
				<lb/>formed a mourning ritual ceremony
				<lb/>for her exhibition, Your 5,000 Years
				<lb/>Are Up, entitled Mourning Our Lost
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb/>Herstory, at the Mandeville Gallery,
				<lb/>University of California at La Jolla.
				<lb/>Ten women sat in a circle in the cen
				<lb/>ter of a fire ring, the only source of
				<lb/>light, chanting and wailing while
				<lb/>seven silent eight-foot high black
				<lb/>draped figures, which had previously
				<lb/>seemed to be an uninhabitated formal
				<lb/>sculptural installation on the back
				<lb/>wall, came alive and began to move
				<lb/>around the cavernous gallery. More
				<lb/>recently, she performed a mourning
				<lb/>reclamation ritual at A.I.R. Gallery,
				<lb/>New York City, entitled Proposals For.
				<lb/>Memorials to the 9,000,000 Women
				<lb/>Burned as Witches in the Christian
				<lb/>Era. This ritual, based on research
				<lb/>about witch burning in relation to
				<lb/>women who were Goddess worship
				<lb/>pers evoked the spirits of individual
				<lb/>women who were tortured during the
				<lb/>Inquisition. Edelson is not content,
				<lb/>however, to exorcise the past; her art
				<lb/>is about mythic recreation of holy
				<lb/>spaces for women’s culture today.
				<lb/>Donna Henes’s Spider Woman, a
				<lb/>series of process environmental sculp
				<lb/>tures, makes reference to the Mother
				<lb/>Goddess of the Navaho Emergence
				<lb/>Myth about whom Sheila Moon has
				<lb/>written, "She is the protective fem
				<lb/>inine objectivity. Spider Woman is the
				<lb/>unobtrusive but powerful archetype
				<lb/>of fate—not in the sense of deter
				<lb/>minism, but in the sense of the
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb/>magical law of one's own ’gravity
				<lb/>which leads always beyond itself
				<lb/>towards wholeness.””0 In a state of
				<lb/>trance and meditation, Henes spins
				<lb/>her web of various kinds of fibers in
				<lb/>natural settings and in public places
				<lb/>where they can be altered by the
				<lb/>specific environmental conditions of
				<lb/>each location. Her manifesto" defines
				<lb/>the web as a map of the subconscious
				<lb/>and as a form of primal meditation.
				<lb/>Henes performs a yearly winter sol
				<lb/>stice celebration Reverence to Her: A
				<lb/>Chant to Invoke the Female Forces of
				<lb/>the Universe Present in All People.
				<lb/>The winter solstice is the time when
				<lb/>"the Great Mother gives birth to the
				<lb/>sun, who is Her son, and stands at the
				<lb/>center of the matriarchal mysteries.
				<lb/>At the winter solstice, the moon oc
				<lb/>cupies the highest point in its cycle,
				<lb/>the sun is at its nadir, and the constel
				<lb/>lation Virgo rises in the east."12
				<lb/>Henes’s participatory chant invokes
				<lb/>the Great Goddess, the archetypal
				<lb/>female principle of communal crea
				<lb/>tion and continuity, and gives rev
				<lb/>erence to the female power “who ex
				<lb/>ists in all beings in the form of con
				<lb/>sciousness, reason, sleep, hunger,
				<lb/>shadow, energy, thirst, forgiveness

				<lb/>If the webs are a materialization of
				<lb/>a female spirit-presence in the en
				<lb/>vironment, a kind of feminine struc
				<lb/>ture within matter itself, her work
				<lb/>makes us visualize this presence,
				<lb/>evokes it, and brings it forth out of the
				<lb/>void, making manifest the intercon
				<lb/>nectedness of all space and time
				<lb/>through the weaving of the great web
				<lb/>of life, which is the work of the Mother
				<lb/>Goddess. This is the actualization of a

				<lb/>Betye Saar’s work, through its mys
				<lb/>tical, visionary imagery, probes the
				<lb/>collective unconscious for those
				<lb/>images of female power specific to
				<lb/>black women. By delving deeply into

				<lb/>Haiti, Saar resurrects images of the

				<lb/>and the Queen of the Witches, col
				<lb/>lecting the amulets and artifacts of
				<lb/>these cultures and placing them in her
				<lb/>boxes in order to create potent talis

				<lb/>1977, Betsy Damon covered herself
				<lb/>with small bags of colored flour which

				<lb/>the artist and her assistant, through
				<lb/>intense concentration and medita
				<lb/>tion, had incorporated a bit of lost
				<lb/>time into the aura of their conscious

				<lb/>contemporary Goddess-culture art
				<lb/>seeks to transform the body and the
				<lb/>consciousness of modern woman by
				<lb/>infusing it with a sense of herstory

				<lb/>Damon has been performing rituals
				<lb/>in nature for several years, working
				<lb/>collectively with women, creating
				<lb/>rites of anger, rebirth and transforma
				<lb/>tion, such as the Birth Ritual, in which
				<lb/>each woman gives birth to another
				<lb/>chanting, "I am a woman. I can give
				<lb/>birth to you." In the Naming Ritual
				<lb/>performed in Ithaca, women chanted,
				<lb/>"I am a woman. I give you my hand
				<lb/>We are women. Our circle is power

			<p>
				<lb/>ful." After the chanting they intoned
				<lb/>the names of all the women in the

				<lb/>Hannah Kay, an Israeli artist living
				<lb/>in New York, paints the ultimate
				<lb/>breakthrough of Earth Goddess energy
				<lb/>that parallels the advent of female
				<lb/>autonomy in the new era ot feminist
				<lb/>consciousness. She writes that in hei

				<lb/>then the whole universe. A woman's
				<lb/>body is, in itself, the whole universe:
				<lb/>birth, life, death, and communica
				<lb/>tion. The human body manifests all
				<lb/>the laws of the universe; and for me
				<lb/>the woman’s body is the sensuality of

				<lb/>Judy Chicago has made a major
				<lb/>contribution to this tradition by con
				<lb/>ceptualizing and creating a traveling
				<lb/>multi-media exhibition, The Dinner
				<lb/>Party Project, an environmental re
				<lb/>casting of the history of Western
				<lb/>civilization in feminist terms.15. Ac
				<lb/>companying the Dinner Party Proj-
				<lb/>ect's exhibition, is a book in the form
				<lb/>of an illuminated manuscript of five
				<lb/>sections, some of which include a re
				<lb/>writing of Genesis as an alternate
				<lb/>creation myth in which the Goddess is
				<lb/>the supreme Creatrix. It also contains
				<lb/>a section of myths, legends and tales
				<lb/>of the women, a vision of the Apoc
				<lb/>alypse which is a vision of the world
				<lb/>made whole by the infusion of fem
				<lb/>inist values, and the Calling of the
				<lb/>Disciplines, a list of the women rep
				<lb/>resented in the table relating who they
				<lb/>were and what they did.
				<lb/>Chicago’s work has long been mak
				<lb/>ing links between female iconography
				<lb/>and a feminist reinterpretation of the
				<lb/>Creation Myth. In her series of por
				<lb/>celain plates entitled The Butterfly
				<lb/>Coddesses: Other Specimens (1974)
				<lb/>which includes The Butterfly Vagina
				<lb/>as the Venus of Willendorf, The But
				<lb/>terfly Vagina as the Creat Round, etc.
				<lb/>sexuality is expressly connected to
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb/>spiritual transformation. For Chicago
				<lb/>the butterfly symbolizes both liberty
				<lb/>and metamorphosis. The new speci
				<lb/>mens in The Butterfly Coddess series
				<lb/>represent a new breed of women:
				<lb/>these are women yet to be born to a

				<lb/>Monica Sjoo’s synthesizing of ar
				<lb/>tistic, political and mythological ma

				<lb/>dess-consciousness in England. Her
				<lb/>underground pamphlet, The Ancient
				<lb/>Religion of the Creat Cosmic Mother
				<lb/>of AIl, which will be published by
				<lb/>Womanspirit in the coming year, is
				<lb/>a poetic attempt to cull all informa
				<lb/>tion that can be obtained through a
				<lb/>feminist occult reading of history,
				<lb/>symbolism, myth, art and literature,
				<lb/>and bring it into a powerful reevalua
				<lb/>tion of many of the philosophical
				<lb/>underpinnings of contemporary
				<lb/>thought. Her art works create Goddess
				<lb/>emblems which narrate the story of
				<lb/>the real crucifixion, that of women
				<lb/>who have been sacrificed upon the
			</p>
			<pb n='84'/>
			<p>
				<lb/>cross of patriarchal culture. They
				<lb/>speak of female rebirth into a new

				<lb/>of women as workers and visionaries.
				<lb/>Contemporary Goddess-culture art
				<lb/>with its many varied manifestations,
				<lb/>is creating a whole new constellation
				<lb/>of charged signs, aspirational images
				<lb/>icons for contemplation, talismanic
				<lb/>artifacts, and symbolic rites of pas
				<lb/>sage that constitute the source of a
				<lb/>new reality for women
				<lb/>Artists of the Surrealist tradition like
				<lb/>Leonora Carrington, Leonor Fini
				<lb/>Meret Oppenheim, Frida Kahlo anc
				<lb/>Remedios Varo, artists participating ir
				<lb/>the Sister Chapel exhibition (Woman
				<lb/>art, Winter 1977) such as Diana Kurz
				<lb/>and Cynthia Mailman, Canadiar
				<lb/>artists Jovette Marchessault (totemic
				<lb/>sculptural figures) and Suzanne Guité
				<lb/>(stone sculpture), Thérèse Guité
				<lb/>(batik) and other contemporary Amer
				<lb/>ican artists such as Faith Wilding,
				<lb/>Suzanne Benton (welded sculpture
				<lb/>and mask ritual theater), Julia Barklen
				<lb/>etc. are creating a new feminist myth
				<lb/>in which woman becomes the vital
				<lb/>connecting link between all forms of
				<lb/>life in the cosmos; the great catalyser
				<lb/>and transformer of life energies. By

			<p>
				<lb/>the repossession of Goddess power
				<lb/>and by a full participation in Her Be

				<lb/>Through the many ceremonies of
				<lb/>rebirth and reclamation, the rituals of

				<lb/>of hieroglyphics, using trance, med

				<lb/>Should l love a woman?

				<lb/>...have you ever felt the return of memories too old for the written history of
				<lb/>human glory? I feel pulsating rhythms too primitive for my sophisticated generation
				<lb/>...it is as though some primeval instinct has opened its doors within a sacred place
				<lb/>inside I hear strange languages of visual forms and yet I know it is not mad
				<lb/>ness... my feet dance the rhythms of simplicity, my hands accompany the rhythm..
				<lb/>TIME FOR A DREAM: I was two people, one a child watching the other me modeling
				<lb/>objects, cloudlike forms. I knew I was modeling forms with the shadows attached as
				<lb/>though I were God. I needed no light for the shadows. I also knew I was alseep but
				<lb/>Ireally was a live vital being creating the forms and the child was looking on in
				<lb/>amazement. The child appeared remote. I never had a dream where I knew that !
				<lb/>had left my body sleeping on the bed and had gone into the "land of dreams."
				<lb/>...good morning me! I wish to extend to myself a very happy birthday. .. walking
				<lb/>on this birthday down second avenue to meet Jack and kept repeating to myselt
				<lb/>33...33...33... and what have you done and what have you learned I said to myselt
				<lb/>as a smile rose in my heart. ..l have lived well and have learned joy of living and at
				<lb/>33 years I feel no regrets...the gods have been kind and have deprived me of noth
				<lb/>ing and this is the greatest of all gifts I feel today..
				<lb/>When was the last time you looked
				<lb/>into the face of unspoken screams
				<lb/>sitting on the subway, Monday morning. ..the malla beads in my hand.each
				<lb/>bead becoming the maniacal face of a human head... each face contorted, pressed
				<lb/>in lines of the terrible tragedy of the human story on earth. .. dear heart where is the
				<lb/>comedy to break the cruel energy... another day. ..the comedy is the other side of
				<lb/>the coin Sidele ...just look harder!...
				<lb/>...the struggle continues...the struggle for my own soul is still a real reality and
				<lb/>cannot underestimate any longer the primal self of this creature, Sidele...nothing
				<lb/>wants to die and yet for me to shed the skin of a self whose needs feed on self-pity,
				<lb/>morality of right and wrong, etc. I must continue to exorcise this devil without anger
				<lb/>with love but with firmness. I wish to enter the land of the immortals!...
				<lb/>"Rain falling on the Brooklyn streets
				<lb/>the mind of Sidele searching for poetic visions"
				<lb/>.today as l sit in our front room reflecting on the movement and changes in my
				<lb/>life I see that from this being called Sidele C. Scot I am molding a recognizable form
				<lb/>I was given all the primary ingredients and now I must do what is necessary..
				<lb/>maybe this is the reason why painting doesn’t seem so very important to me...l am
				<lb/>really so busy creating the living being of myself that the canvas feels so secondary
				<lb/>so far removed from the primary source!...there are different images I have within
				<lb/>me for each stage that is set. ..STAGE: being, levels of conscious awareness...the
				<lb/>child in me could only die when I (whatever that is because I was the child for over
				<lb/>30 years) became conscious of its pattern and no longer needed it...
			</p>
			<pb n='87'/>
			<p>
				<lb/>Strange... we spend our life in learning how to live
				<lb/>...another day...if l wasn’t experiencing it I would never believe it possible...such
				<lb/>terrible pain. .. pain and fear. ..are they inseparable... dear sweet gentle heart, a
				<lb/>deep breath here is I can hear the echoes of my madness floating in and
				<lb/>out around and around like a ghostly apparition. .. how absurd, how foolish to waste
				<lb/>myself away on platitides whose only meaning equals 34 years equals Sidele C. Scot
				<lb/>I am born 34 years old 3 months a few days a few hours untold seconds and I can
				<lb/>never record the true or real moment of the birth. ..it is always a little before or a
				<lb/>little after me. I don’t seem to be able to ever experience a present. AH, WHAI
				<lb/>THEN IS THE PRESENT! listen Sidele, there is no present, past, future, etc., all there
				<lb/>is is change.. all else a fabrication of the human mind!
				<lb/>..and yet another day...when I ask mercy from the unknowable fear and ecstasy
				<lb/>that I call God I must understand the difference between the mercy God does show
				<lb/>and the action I must take. ..ah, dear creature, don’t you see that God has nothing
				<lb/>at all to do with mercy. ..it is Sidele that must extend the mercy...
				<lb/>..and yet another day. I want to reach the limits of my potential. ..l want to
				<lb/>explore the abyss within me. I want the known to move over and make way for
				<lb/>the unknown...(1977, VOILA!)
				<lb/>It is interesting to note that in order
				<lb/>to be a painter all I have to do is paint
				<lb/>TRAGEDY: the human animal if it is lucky will spend more than halt
				<lb/>a lifetime in finding out that it is no better (or worse) than anyone
				<lb/>or anything else ...others are not that lucky.
				<lb/>TRAGEDY: the overwhelming feelings of pain and disillusionment etc.
				<lb/>that plague people are nothing more than terrible misunderstanding
				<lb/>...wrong information.
				<lb/>TRAGEDY: and few listen to the sounds of experience.
				<lb/>...am I really the composite of days past. ..is my destiny knowledge of knowing
				<lb/>and yet not knowing. ..an unquenchable trust for what I know is not the end but
				<lb/>always a beginning...
				<lb/>...our lives are so silly I remember times of looking for motivation to
				<lb/>rid myself of the heaviness, the nausea within...not until now do I realize the true
				<lb/>motivation for my own movement. ..it is simply a matter of survival..
				<lb/>...have you ever found in your living that you reached a point or place and you
				<lb/>wanted to run away. ..that it became too painful to grow anymore...
				<lb/>BEHOLD, A REAL REALITY...as a young girl I took the spoken word so seriously and
				<lb/>molded it into its absolute form forgetting that I Sidele, was far more important
				<lb/>than any I Sidele, this form transcends the limitations that human minds
				<lb/>I Sidele, am beyond these narrow judgments of right and wrong, lesbian,
				<lb/>I Sidele, am no label. ..it is like being a Jew, a Christian, a Moslem, a
				<lb/>I Sidele, am all these things and none touch my innermost secrets...l,
				<lb/>Sidele, am like a shadow in the path of shining light!
				<lb/>I do not want to live in fear.
				<lb/>..again and again the return of the old malady of such a strong need for self
				<lb/>I cannot understand why I provoke the demons as though taking a
				<lb/>stick to poke the fires of hell and the stick being my life. .. how come it is so hard
				<lb/>to accept and feel my own existence... maybe destruction or rather the appearances
				<lb/>of destruction is something that people do to cover up a supreme love of self...
				<lb/>something like excessive good manners...

				<lb/>NOTES ON PROGRESS: the deaths within myself have given me a new dignity...
				<lb/>death seems to make life more precious. .. not as a hoarder but I have
				<lb/>lived so many lifetimes it seems and how painful it is for me to keep finding myself
				<lb/>a I know I am a form. ..fully functioning and yet I find it hard to
				<lb/>remember what I look like...the quest for the golden form. ..a search to find my
				<lb/>real nature...to find what I was before I assumed a disguise...to consolidate the
				<lb/>many facets of my being!...
				<lb/>Enigma... why did Ophelia drown?
				<lb/>Enigma...once I knew I had to create each day I knew I knew nothing.
				<lb/>Enigma...the sadness...the pain of the human life!
				<lb/>...as the years pass the dream becomes so vague... must see clearly once again this
				<lb/>vision... what is it for me to be Sidele, Sidele, Sidele, I call you from the echoes of
				<lb/>a dream. .. awake creature..
				<lb/>...in my personal life it was not the fear of God or the fear of unspoken words that
				<lb/>caused sickness...it was fear of life filled with responsibility... commitments...a
				<lb/>life filled with love of Sidele functioning as a unique being...
				<lb/>A MOMENT OF THE TIME:
				<lb/>a moment of the time...sitting in my studio on a cloudy day alone with the silences
				<lb/>of familiar sounds, alone with this creature whose appearance takes the form Sidele C.
				<lb/>Scot, female of the species homo sapiens... the days have been hard. ..nightmares
				<lb/>of truth have shaken the very core of my existence and now it is the time to gather
				<lb/>the remains of years of dissipation and negation, of an inner hatred and despair
				<lb/>whose depths I have just seen and whose truth gives rise to Dantean screams whose
				<lb/>echoes resound in the walls of hell...earth. I have reached the bottom of the abyss
				<lb/>which each form carries within its existence. ..sadness is not the word, nor is despair
				<lb/>...reality in this dimension is like the quiet of a gray day. No tears! for this I am
				<lb/>grateful... how strange it is that I should not care about understanding and I should
				<lb/>not care about keeping my word and I should not really care about any of those
				<lb/>things I concerned half a lifetime I suppose when the self is confronted with
				<lb/>the self it no longer is concerned with what others think. ..it is only the self that the
				<lb/>self is really concerned with and vet was it all a lie...a terrible ghostly deception the
				<lb/>unconscious self played upon the acting form. .. has half a lifetime been spent just
				<lb/>to learn the meaning of tragedy. Maybe the mind echoes in its innermost chambers,
				<lb/>maybe there is nothing more to life than learning the proper way to die!...
				<lb/>...and another gray rainy day once again sitting in my studio listening to the sounds
				<lb/>of traveling cars, scratching pens, echoing voices somewhere, somehow communi
				<lb/>cating. ..so many days of sickness...so many days of sadness. .. my heart cries and
				<lb/>the face sits on top of the neck immobile...the mind reflects on the shadows of
				<lb/>memories long forgotten...long remembered and the Sidele who does the walking
				<lb/>who carries these unreflected images around says stoically what next. Will the
				<lb/>remainder of my days be spent in studios alone with only myself to say hello to..
				<lb/>to speak to...another gray day followed by another gray day. ..this time in the
				<lb/>laundry sitting waiting for clothes to wash. ..to dry...to fold. My mind wandering
				<lb/>reflecting on the stupidity. ..the ignorance of my days. .. always awakening too late
				<lb/>Too late to see the simplicity of our lives. ..awakening and yet, how great the desire
				<lb/>to be lost in illusion...if only I had known it was my life l was living and the
				<lb/>destruction I was inflicting upon this mortal body was upon Sidele I would not be
				<lb/>sitting here now in the pain and hopelessness of my sterility and yet, Sidele C. Scot,
				<lb/>woman, is what she is because of what she was. ..another Sunday in May and the
				<lb/>gray skies overhead...silence in my studio...the sound of the gas stove...the

				<lb/>Opposing the Rape of Mother Earth

				<lb/>Some feminists see themselves as exclusively “political
				<lb/>feminists" or as "spiritual feminists,” and many find it
				<lb/>difficult to understand the other’s point of view. The spir
				<lb/>itualists feel that the politicalists are too narrow or in
				<lb/>sensitive to what they regard as "a more encompassing
				<lb/>feminist consciousness,” whereas the politicalists con
				<lb/>sider the spiritualists impractical and believe that they
				<lb/>avoid "the reality of the real political issues." I think that
				<lb/>it is extremely important for us to realize that this division
				<lb/>between the spiritual and the political is arbitrary and
				<lb/>unnecessarily divisive. I hope to illustrate the positive re
				<lb/>lationship between spirituality and politics by discussing
				<lb/>the ancient Anasazi spiritual beliefs and the present day
				<lb/>struggle of their descendants, the Hopi, to preserve their
				<lb/>land from strip-mining.
				<lb/>The Anasazi world view is difficult for us to talk abou
				<lb/>because our sentence structure and words, which in
				<lb/>evitably reflect our own world view, imply distinctions
				<lb/>that they did not make. This is a matter of metaphysics,
				<lb/>whether we like that term or not, and it is necessary to
				<lb/>consider yet another distinction that derives from oun
				<lb/>European western metaphysics—one that is alien to
				<lb/>Anasazi belief. We assume a distinction between "living
				<lb/>things, such as animals and plants, and "non-living” ones,
				<lb/>such as rocks and water. The distinction did not exist for
				<lb/>the early Anasazi people and still does not exist for many
				<lb/>of their present-day descendants. For the Anasazi/Hopi
				<lb/>trees, insects, rocks, people, water—are all living, vir
				<lb/>tually interconnected parts of a living Whole. Earth is
				<lb/>not just a huge chunk of inanimate matter with animate
				<lb/>beings scurrying around on top. Mother Earth is a living
				<lb/>being. Earth’s creations cannot be reduced to inanimate
				<lb/>atomic particles, subject only to physio-chemical laws
				<lb/>because no such things exist. Atoms are alive, energizec
				<lb/>by the same vitality that we experience.
				<lb/>Once we can view the world without separating the
				<lb/>animate from the inanimate, we can better understand
				<lb/>the interconnectedness of all things and the consequent
				<lb/>possibility for what we call psychic phenomena. For the
				<lb/>Anasazi, thought was not a mere epiphenomenon of a few
				<lb/>pounds of cerebral cortex but was in itself a vital, viable
				<lb/>powerful force that could and did affect things in the
				<lb/>world, such as the weather and other natural forces. Our
				<lb/>own orientation confuses us when we try to understand
				<lb/>this because as soon as we say "affect things,” we assume
				<lb/>a linear version of cause and effect. The Anasazi held a
				<lb/>more complex concept of reality. Since they regarded all
				<lb/>things as related to each other, cause and effect were not
				<lb/>a simple matter of a one-two chain reaction, but rather a
				<lb/>complex interrelationship, a network, a pattern in which
				<lb/>they perceived cycles as well as lines, and subtle as well
				<lb/>as gross power.
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb/>The Anasazi expressed the metaphysical truth of the
				<lb/>interrelatedness of all things as parts in a great dynamic
				<lb/>Whole in their ceremonial dances. These multi-sensorial,
				<lb/>dynamic dramas were attuned to the cycles of nature
				<lb/>and the positions of certain stars. Within the ceremony
				<lb/>the movements of the dancers were synchronized with
				<lb/>each other and with repetitive, one-two drum beats, the
				<lb/>heartbeat of Mother Earth. Each ceremony in the cycle of
				<lb/>ceremonies was simultaneously a complete, orchestrated
				<lb/>unit as well as an integral part of the Whole cycle. Anal
				<lb/>ogously, each individual participant was an integral part
				<lb/>of the great dynamic Whole of the dance, the cycle, and
				<lb/>all of nature.
				<lb/>Anasazi architecture played an important part in the
				<lb/>ceremonial expressions of this primary truth. The photo
				<lb/>graphs accompanying this essay are of Anasazi pueblo
				<lb/>ruins in Chaco Canyon, New Mexico that were built be
				<lb/>tween 1000 and 1200 A.D. Some of the more extensive
				<lb/>pueblos span about three acres. In some cases pueblos are
				<lb/>built on top of even older ruins, which had been aban
				<lb/>doned by earlier generations of Anasazi. The ceremonial
				<lb/>temples, called kivas, were dug out of the earth, so that
				<lb/>they are wholly or partially subterranean. The kiva illus
				<lb/>trated here is a subterranean Great Kiva and was probably
				<lb/>used by a group of about 1000 people. Smaller kivas were
				<lb/>also at least partially underground and usually circular
				<lb/>Each kiva contained a sipapu, a circular hole dug out of
				<lb/>the floor. The sipapu symbolized the place of emergence
				<lb/>from the last world
				<lb/>Kivas were a part of the daily life of the Anasazi, as
				<lb/>were their spiritual practices. They were used constantly
				<lb/>for ceremonial preparations and rituals.2 For the architects
				<lb/>of these buildings, there was no distinction between the
				<lb/>spiritual and the political, i.e., between their religious and
				<lb/>secular lives—or for that matter between art and non-art
				<lb/>Religion and art were an integral part of daily life. The
				<lb/>Anasazi’s ritual ceremonies celebrated life and their daily
				<lb/>lives celebrated the beauty of a total reality, naturally in
				<lb/>cluding what we call the spiritual
				<lb/>The Anasazi ceremonies were held either inside the
				<lb/>circular, partially underground kivas or in the plaza,
				<lb/>framed by these concentric, step-like buildings. As Vin
				<lb/>cent Scully says, "Most of the dances of ritual ...are
				<lb/>held, now as in the recorded past, tight up against the
				<lb/>buildings. .. And the beat of those dances is built into the
				<lb/>architecture, which thus dances too."3
				<lb/>The architecture’s very structure expressed the meta
				<lb/>physical belief in the interdependence and interconnect
				<lb/>edness of all things in a dynamic Whole. The pueblo was
				<lb/>composed of interconnected cells, so that it was quite
				<lb/>typical for one unit’s south wall to be the next unit’s north
				<lb/>wall. The living units were all about the same size, reflect
			</p>
			<pb n='91'/>
			<p>
				<lb/>ing the egalitarian social belief of the Anasazi. Each of
				<lb/>these cellular units was owned by a woman. The Anasazi
				<lb/>were matrilineal and matrilocal. When a daughter mar
				<lb/>ried, a unit was built adjacent to that of her mother anc
				<lb/>she and her husband moved in. (In case of divorce, the
				<lb/>man moved out, leaving the woman in a relatively more
				<lb/>secure position, since she had the house and the suppori
				<lb/>of her own clan.) The layout of the Anasazi pueblo was a
				<lb/>direct result of this matrilocal arrangement: Constructior
				<lb/>occurred only where daughters were born. A family tha
				<lb/>had many daughters could be evidenced by a cluster o
				<lb/>pueblo units. In an area of the pueblo where only sons
				<lb/>were born, new construction did not take place; in fact
				<lb/>because the clans were matrilineal, a clan that failed to
				<lb/>have daughters became extinci
				<lb/>Laura Thompson points out the value in this kind of
				<lb/>growth pattern: "Reproduction in this organically con
				<lb/>ceived society is ideally by means of budding. As the Hop
				<lb/>matrilineal clan grows by adding daughter households to
				<lb/>the mother unit, so the pueblo expands by the budding of
				<lb/>daughter colonies from the original nucleus. Thus ideally
				<lb/>the society is able to augment and completely recon
				<lb/>stitute itself."
				<lb/>This budding type of growth pattern is different from
				<lb/>that of our architecture. For us, the basic structural unit is
				<lb/>the building to which new rooms, patios, etc., can be
				<lb/>added. Pueblo architecture’s basic structural unit is the
				<lb/>room itself, and growth consists of indefinite repetition of
				<lb/>this basic unit. Although J.B. Jackson seems to consider
				<lb/>this growth pattern inferior to our more “complex” way of
				<lb/>building, he points out that it seems to imply “the belies
				<lb/>in the cumulative power of infinite repetition.”» This be
				<lb/>liet is also reflected in the Chaco Canyon masonry, which
				<lb/>prefers small stones to large ones. Jackson says, "It is as i
				<lb/>the builders were saying that a wall is sturdy when it is
				<lb/>made out of a multitude of identical small fragments."6
				<lb/>think it is likely that these builders, who were members of
				<lb/>a matrilineal, egalitarian society and who expressed thein
				<lb/>spiritual beliefs via repetitive, cyclic ceremonies, dic
				<lb/>believe in the "cumulative power of infinite repetition.
				<lb/>That idea seems difficult for Jackson to honor, but then he
				<lb/>is a member of a patriarchal, hierarchical society whose
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb/>architecture, social ideals, and religious institutions
				<lb/>radically differ from those of Anasazi society
				<lb/>Probably the most dramatic difference between Ana
				<lb/>sazi architecture and ours is the relationship of its forms
				<lb/>to the earth. This difference is most marked in the struc
				<lb/>ture of the kivas. European influenced churches are
				<lb/>capped with phallic steeples, straining to leave the earth
				<lb/>to reach the male God in the sky; arches cleave walls well
				<lb/>above human height, pointing to the same exalted being
				<lb/>By total contrast, Anasazi architecture hugs Mother Earth,
				<lb/>and the most sacred is the lowest and most enveloped
				<lb/>Kivas are dug out of the earth and are usually circular
				<lb/>reflecting earth’s form.” The most sacred part of the entire
				<lb/>pueblo, the sipapu, the place of emergence from the last
				<lb/>world, is dug deep into the already subterranean kiva.
				<lb/>This sacred orifice is protected by the circular kiva, whose
				<lb/>walls may be of many thicknesses. The kiva is in turn sur
				<lb/>rounded by the pueblo, which may also have a concentric
				<lb/>layou
				<lb/>The concentric arrangement of the kivas may reflect
				<lb/>the matrifocused spiritual beliefs of the Anasazi. The
				<lb/>walls of some kivas are nearly two feet thick.? They are
				<lb/>made up of stones, mortar, layers of plaster and (some
				<lb/>times) paint. Frank C. Hibben reports that "In some kivas
				<lb/>having many painted coats of plaster, the layers them
				<lb/>selves made up perhaps a third of the thickness of the
				<lb/>walls."9 These concentric layers symbolically protect the
				<lb/>sipapu and the people inside the kiva. For the Anasazi,
				<lb/>Hopi, two types of labyrinth symbolize Mother Earth a
				<lb/>she enfolds each soul, gives it birth and receives the spirit
				<lb/>back at the end of the person’s path through life."
			</p>
			<pb n='92'/>
			<p>
				<lb/>The same symbolism seems to be the underlying mo
				<lb/>tive of the layout of the pueblo itself. There are two basic
				<lb/>kinds of ground plan apparent in the pueblos throughout
				<lb/>the Southwest that echo the two maze shapes. One is a
				<lb/>sort of semicircular or capital letter D shape (analogous to
				<lb/>Figure 1); the other is a more rectangular, roughly E shape
				<lb/>—sometimes with the center bar missing (analogous to
				<lb/>Figure 2). All of the rooms on any one level of a pueblo
				<lb/>are connected by doorways, so that it is possible to enter
				<lb/>a room at one end and wind one’s way through the rooms
				<lb/>to the other end. The multiple rows of rooms arranged
				<lb/>around a central plaza create a concentric, centripetal
				<lb/>design. That this labyrinthine structure was intended to
				<lb/>symbolize Mother Earth is at least plausible; if it does, this
				<lb/>is another way in which the Anasazi expressed their spir
				<lb/>itual beliefs
				<lb/>We have already discussed the intimate connection
				<lb/>between the Anasazi’s matrifocused society and the
				<lb/>growth pattern of their architecture, and between the
				<lb/>matrifocused spiritual beliefs and the structure of their
				<lb/>kivas, if not the entire pueblo complex. But it is even
				<lb/>more interesting to realize that this architecture was to a
				<lb/>great extent built by women. Apparently the division of
				<lb/>labor was that the men cut and laid the timber (which
				<lb/>made the ceilings and partially framed the doors) and the
				<lb/>women built the walls. It is not common knowledge
				<lb/>among anthropologists that women were the major par
				<lb/>ticipants in building some of the most spectacular archi
				<lb/>tecture in North America."" Not surprisingly, I came
				<lb/>across this bit of information in male literature, which
				<lb/>mentioned it in the process of denigrating women. The
				<lb/>following passage, written by George Kubler, was based
				<lb/>on the records of the seventeenth century Franciscan
				<lb/>missionary Benavides. The passage blames certain "neg
				<lb/>ative aspects" in missionary architecture on women’s role
				<lb/>in its construction, and in the process indicates that wom
				<lb/>en built pueblo walls in ancient times. I quote this passage
				<lb/>at length because its ethnocentricity and phallocentricity
				<lb/>are so appallingly blatant as to be humorous (in an adren
				<lb/>alin-producing kind of way):
				<lb/>"The evidence of the buildings constitutes proof that two
				<lb/>commonplace devices of European building found no use
				<lb/>in New Mexico during the missionary era. The arch is al
				<lb/>most nonexistent, and the dome is completely lacking, but
				<lb/>both forms may readily be built with the local materials.
				<lb/>Why were they excluded from the architectural repertory of
				<lb/>the mission buildings? It is to be recalled that, to this day,
				<lb/>the Indians themselves never use either the arch or the
				<lb/>dome. In dealing with these negative aspects of the struc
				<lb/>ture, reference must be made to the passage. .. trom Bena
				<lb/>vides, pertaining to the participation of women in con
				<lb/>struction. Since Benavides, the roles have been reversed
				<lb/>the women now spin and weave, and the men build walls.
				<lb/>But the women own the houses in the pueblos, and the
				<lb/>ownership itself is perhaps a remnant from the time wher
				<lb/>building was the women’s prerogative. Does this indif
				<lb/>ference to alien forms, so unlike the ready acceptance
				<lb/>found in Mexico, stem from the women?...lt is likely that
				<lb/>resistance was encountered in New Mexico. .. and it seem:
				<lb/>reasonable to localize this resistance in the participation of
				<lb/>women. The point cannot be proved by asserting that
				<lb/>women are temperamentally more conservative, or indif
				<lb/>ferent to structural considerations: the evidence of the
				<lb/>monuments and the known control of their construction by
				<lb/>Indian women induce a correlation between the two, with
				<lb/>out reference to a priori considerations." Perhaps this cor
				<lb/>relation is to be expressed in terms of a traditional division
				<lb/>of labor among men and women, the men executing the
				<lb/>carpentry and woodwork, as indicated by Benavides, and
				<lb/>the women opposing any increase in their own share."
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb/>certainly doubt that the absence of domes and arches
				<lb/>is due to the women’s laziness, as Kubler suggests. Nor
				<lb/>were the women likely to have been "indifferent to struc
				<lb/>tural considerations, since prior to the white man’s en
				<lb/>croachment they were capable of building Pueblo Bonito,
				<lb/>Chetro Ketl, and dozens of other multiroomed, multi
				<lb/>storied earthen monuments. The constructions of a mis
				<lb/>sion would have been a snap by comparison. I do, how
				<lb/>ever, agree with Kubler’s hint that the women were more
				<lb/>"conservative," for it is much that they had to conserve:
				<lb/>their matrilineal, egalitarian society and their ancient
				<lb/>earth-reverencing spiritual beliefs. Kubler doesn’t bother
				<lb/>mentioning that the women weren’t building these mis
			</p>
			<pb n='93'/>
			<p>
				<lb/>sions out of devotion to the white man’s god, but because
				<lb/>they were forced to build them. I prefer to believe that the
				<lb/>women’s refusal to cap the buildings with domes or the
				<lb/>doorways with arches was a subtle way of protesting
				<lb/>against the white man’s phallocentric religion.
				<lb/>Forcing the people to build missions and to attend
				<lb/>church was only part of the oppression the Anasazi/Hopi
				<lb/>experienced." During the missionary era people were
				<lb/>whipped, imprisoned and burned to death. But in the long
				<lb/>run, the most destructive form of oppression was a form
				<lb/>of indoctrination that is extremely difficult to combat. Be
				<lb/>ginning in the late nineteenth century, Hopi children were
				<lb/>literally stolen from their parents and forced to go to
				<lb/>white man’s schools—far from their homes—where they
				<lb/>had to learn to speak in the English language and to think
				<lb/>in patriarchal concepts.14 This insidious form of oppres
				<lb/>sion has had repercussions that are simultaneously polit
				<lb/>ical and spiritual.
				<lb/>Generations of indoctrination into the white man's
				<lb/>world view made other kinds of government influence
				<lb/>possible. Nearly 100 years ago, U.S. government agencies
				<lb/>began insidious efforts aimed at gaining control over Hop
				<lb/>land for mining purposes.15 However, the traditional Hopi
				<lb/>way of making decisions—by clan consensus, in which
				<lb/>every individual’s view counts equally and all must reach
				<lb/>agreement—was a constant impediment to deal-making
				<lb/>and sellouts. So the government instituted a Hopi Tribal
				<lb/>Council, consisting of "elected representatives. Those
				<lb/>sufficiently schooled in the white man’s ways agreed to
				<lb/>vote for and support the Council. But traditional Hop
				<lb/>would not go along with this manipulation of tribal gov
				<lb/>ernment. They boycotted the elections and refused to
				<lb/>recognize the "elected” officials as their representatives.
				<lb/>The traditional Hopi still do not recognize the Tribal
				<lb/>Council, but the U.S. government does. It was with this
				<lb/>Tribal Council that the Department of Interior made its
				<lb/>contract to lease Hopi land to the Peabody Coal Company
				<lb/>for strip-mining. The Hopi Tribal Council stands to gain
				<lb/>more than $14 million over a 35-year period.16 In Hopi
				<lb/>land jobs are scarce, but they are available for those who
				<lb/>support the Tribal Council.
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb/>In spite of generations of attempted indoctrination,
				<lb/>heavy economic pressures, and the demoralizing effects
				<lb/>of watching their own tribe members accept the white
				<lb/>man’s values, a small group of Hopi, along with a few
				<lb/>other Pueblo groups, remain traditional and will not con
				<lb/>sent to their land being strip-mined." Their metaphysic
				<lb/>their spiritual beliefs, their world view—gives them this
				<lb/>strength. They know Mother Earth is a living being and
				<lb/>will not agree to have her raped.
				<lb/>This same world view, which treasures Mother Earth
				<lb/>allows for other phenomena that cannot be explained
				<lb/>by our prevailing metaphysic. One such phenomenon
				<lb/>crucially important to the traditional Hopi is prophetic
				<lb/>visions. The Hopi have been guided by visions for count
				<lb/>less centuries. In fact, visions guided the people to Chaco
				<lb/>Canyon after many hundreds of years of migration through
				<lb/>out North and South America.18 It is here that the Anazasi
				<lb/>built their earthen architecture and here that their de
				<lb/>scendants still choose to live.
				<lb/>The white man’s appearance in Pueblo country was
				<lb/>prophesied long before he came. The prophesies predict
				<lb/>ed that if the white man came bearing the sign of the
				<lb/>circle, he would live in beneficial harmony with the Hopi
				<lb/>But if he came bearing the sign of the cross, he had lost
				<lb/>his true belief and would bring sickness and death with
				<lb/>him. The Anasazi women understood all too well the real
				<lb/>meaning of the cross crowning the missions that they were
				<lb/>forced to build.
				<lb/>The prophetic visions revealed that this new race of
				<lb/>people would be able to fly through the air and would
				<lb/>speak to each other through what appeared in the visions
				<lb/>to be "cobwebs in the sky." The visions also foretold of a
				<lb/>road "like a ribbon" that would run through the Hopi
				<lb/>villages. Hopi men were later forced to build such a road
				<lb/>while working on chain gangs as punishment for resisting
				<lb/>government attempts to educate their children.
				<lb/>Many of the prophesies have become realities, but
				<lb/>there are still more that pertain to the future. A crucial
				<lb/>prophecy, still unfolding, is that men will come to try to
				<lb/>take what lies under Hopi land. All of Mother Earth is
				<lb/>sacred to the Hopi. They believe that they live at the very
				<lb/>heart of this continent, the geomagnetic center—and that
				<lb/>tampering with Mother Earth at this sacred center will
				<lb/>create a serious imbalance. The prophecy warns that the
				<lb/>people should not let the men take what is under their
				<lb/>land. For the Hopi who have been indoctrinated into the
				<lb/>white man’s world view, a view in which prophetic visions
				<lb/>are not valued, such a warning has little meaning. Yet
				<lb/>those who have managed to cling to their ancient world
				<lb/>view and spiritual knowledge take the warning very
				<lb/>seriously. These people will try to protect Mother Earth
				<lb/>from strip-mining
				<lb/>Ecology-minded feminists may oppose strip-mining
				<lb/>and see the struggle of the Hopi with the U.S. government
				<lb/>as a political situation. The Hopi know it is a political
				<lb/>and a spiritual struggle. For them, the concepts of "polit
				<lb/>ical" and "spiritual" are so tightly woven that in the cloth
				<lb/>of reality, they cannot be separated.
				<lb/>Both spiritual awareness and political action are ur
				<lb/>gently needed to protect the Hopi land from strip-mining
				<lb/>and from other attempts to exploit Mother Earth. To find

				<lb/>1. The name Anasazi is not a Pueblo Indian name. Its a
				<lb/>Navaho word meaning ancient ones, although the
				<lb/>Navaho are not descended from the Anasazi. Some
				<lb/>where along the line, anthropologists started using this
				<lb/>name for the people who inhabited the Four Corners
				<lb/>region (where Colorado, Utah, Arizona and New Mex
				<lb/>ico meet) from about 1 A.D. through 1300. The Hopi
				<lb/>and other Pueblo tribes are descended from the Anasa
				<lb/>zi. My discussion of Anasazi world view and socia
				<lb/>structure is based largely on what I know of the Hopi
				<lb/>believed by many to be the most traditional and there
				<lb/>fore the most similar to their ancestors

				<lb/>Pilgrimage/See for Yourself:
				<lb/>A Journey to a Neolithic
				<lb/>Goddess Cave, 1977.
				<lb/>Grapceva, Hvar Island,
				<lb/>Yugoslavia.
				<lb/>Mary Beth Edelson
				<lb/>Island of Hvar —Sunny Adriatic island of vineyards,
				<lb/>olive groves, aromatic plants and ancient culture
				<lb/>From a tourist brochure.
				<lb/>For some years I had been attempting to make
				<lb/>a pilgrimage to a Goddess site. I had been doing
				<lb/>private rituals in my art for some time, both out
				<lb/>doors in nature and in the studio. I could feed off
				<lb/>of them and hold them in my mind like totems.
				<lb/>but I was still hungry. I needed to do my rituals in
				<lb/>an actual prehistoric cave; to experience a Neo
				<lb/>lithic site where I could smell the earth, poke
				<lb/>around in the soil, breathe the air, and know that
				<lb/>the cave air had circulated through my body and
				<lb/>become a part of me. To go to a prehistoric site
				<lb/>became an obsession, and represented the place
				<lb/>to begin a new cycle. Numerous grants had not
				<lb/>materialized and the trip was long overdue. I sold
				<lb/>my car and bought the voyage.
				<lb/>Before leaving New York, I researched seven
				<lb/>sites in hopes of being able to locate and gain
				<lb/>access to at least one of them. I had been there
				<lb/>in my head many times.) My attraction to Yugo
				<lb/>slavia, referred to as "Old Europe” by archaeolo
				<lb/>gists, came from my wanting to start with a
				<lb/>civilization linked to both the earliest Goddess
				<lb/>worship and its art forms as well as to the later
				<lb/>Goddess worshipping cultures. My fantasy and my
				<lb/>plans are to continue my pilgrimage in the coming
				<lb/>years throughout the Mediterranean, to trace our
				<lb/>archaeological herstory, to photograph and docu
				<lb/>ment, perform rituals, gather natural objects from
				<lb/>the sites, and record my responses while trans
				<lb/>lating these perceptions into my work.
				<lb/>After arriving on the island of Hvar in the
				<lb/>Adriatic off the coast of Yugoslavia, I set out to
				<lb/>locate the Neolithic cave called Grapceva, know-
				<lb/>ing only that it was near Jelsa, which turned out
				<lb/>to be a small harbor town on the north side of the
				<lb/>island. My information was gleaned from Marija
				<lb/>Cimbutas’ book, The Cods and Coddesses of Old
				<lb/>Europe,* useful both for its wealth of Goddess
				<lb/>information and its archaeological maps. Though
				<lb/>not adequate for actually locating sites, the maps
				<lb/>did get us to outlying villages. Once in the genera
				<lb/>*Marija Gimbutas, The Cods and Coddesses of Old Europe 7000
				<lb/>3500/Myths, Legends and Cult Images (Berkeley: University of
				<lb/>California Press, 1974), p. 27.

			<p>
				<lb/>area, the best method for finding exact locations
				<lb/>proved to be word-of-mouth. In Jelsa, we (Anne
				<lb/>Healy and I were traveling together) tried to find
				<lb/>someone who spoke English and knew the where
				<lb/>abouts of the Grapceva spilja, chosen because it
				<lb/>appeared that I could be alone there. Little atten
				<lb/>tion had been paid to the site after its initial
				<lb/>excavation in 1955 by Professor Grya Novak.
				<lb/>thought, from reading and intuition, that this cave
				<lb/>was probably used as a sanctuary by Neolithic
				<lb/>people.
				<lb/>The travel agent in Jelsa said flatly that no one
				<lb/>could tell us where the cave was, assuring us that
				<lb/>he had lived in the area all his life and had never
				<lb/>seen it. Obviously it was not worth bothering with.
				<lb/>Finally, we wangled out of him that a villager,
				<lb/>now retired, had led excursions by donkey up the
				<lb/>steep mountain to the cave. The agent had trouble
				<lb/>remembering the guide’s name, but at last it came
				<lb/>out: "Vicko.
				<lb/>Vicko lived on a street behind a cafe in Jelsa.
				<lb/>A second inquiry in town directed us there. "Yell
				<lb/>his name and someone will point to his doorstep.
				<lb/>This done, we were on the threshold of a house
				<lb/>where we were offered old world hospitality and
				<lb/>an abundance of homemade wine. Yes, he was
				<lb/>too old to go up the mountain, but his fourteen
				<lb/>year-old son knew the way
				<lb/>At daybreak the next morning we began the
				<lb/>trip, climbing on and on while we and the heavy
				<lb/>camera gear baked in the intense sun. At the top
				<lb/>of the mountain, beyond the deserted village of
				<lb/>Humac, we began our descent to the barely acces
				<lb/>sible cave. The climb down was a series of straight
				<lb/>drops. What had once been a path was now acres
				<lb/>of mountain stone, obscuring the way to those
				<lb/>unfamiliar with it. Suddenly the blue Adriatic
				<lb/>stretched before us, and in the next moment, we
				<lb/>realized that we had reached the area around the
				<lb/>cave. What an incredible location: the sea vista, a
				<lb/>shelf of flat rock extending from the front of the
				<lb/>cave, fruit and nut trees and berry bushes on
				<lb/>either side. We could easily visualize the daily
				<lb/>activities of the Neolithic inhabitants gathered
				<lb/>there, talking, cooking, sunning.
				<lb/>Vicko’s son unlocked the gate placed over the
				<lb/>mouth of the cave. I can think of our entrance
				<lb/>only in personal terms. It is very difficult to con
				<lb/>vey how thrilling this experience was to me. The
				<lb/>cave was dazzling. It was magnificent. The main
				<lb/>room, the great hall, sparkled and glistened with
				<lb/>coral quartz. Stalagmites and stalactites, suggest
				<lb/>ing great temple pillars, divided the rooms into
				<lb/>chambers. The atmosphere created a feeling of
				<lb/>reverence and awe. For me, it was a holy place.
				<lb/>Vicko’s son began to dig in the floor of the
				<lb/>cave and shortly produced some bones. As it
				<lb/>turned out, there were bones, shards and shells
				<lb/>everywhere. But the cave completely lacked light
				<lb/>and the few candles we had did not begin to
			</p>
			<pb n='98'/>
			<p>
				<lb/>penetrate the surrounding darkness. Although our
				<lb/>eyes could pick up a faint glimmer, a camera
				<lb/>could not record more than the light of the candle
				<lb/>itself. After resting, we headed down the mountain
				<lb/>to ask Vicko whether Anne and I could have the
				<lb/>key to the gate to go back by ourselves the next
				<lb/>day.
				<lb/>The following morning we set out with two
				<lb/>dozen candles and three Yugoslav flashlights. First,
				<lb/>wanted to explore the cave for myself. The low
				<lb/>contracted entrance to the cave opened into an
				<lb/>anteroom or anterior hall with a side chapel of the
				<lb/>darkest and richest coral quartz imaginable. Lead
				<lb/>ing into the great hall, a vaulted ceiling with two
				<lb/>massive stalagmites, which had become pillars,
				<lb/>added to the majesty of the grotto. A dip in the
				<lb/>middle of the hall—no doubt formed from cen
				<lb/>turies of use—was a natural center. To the left
				<lb/>side, chambers formed by smaller stalagmites
				<lb/>turned into narrow passages melting one into
				<lb/>another, curving downwards or upwards. Nature
				<lb/>had produced a complex labyrinth of sanctuaries.
				<lb/>Five "lofts, which circled the back of the great
				<lb/>hall and extended into the chamber rooms about
				<lb/>five feet above the floor of the cave, were large
				<lb/>enough to sleep three or four people. The largest
				<lb/>caught my attention in particular because, unlike
				<lb/>the others, its floor and ceiling were jet black with
				<lb/>specks of mother-of-pearl imbedded in the surface.
				<lb/>Many of the pots recovered from the cave were
				<lb/>made from this black clay; others were made from
				<lb/>more traditional red clays.
				<lb/>crawled into the space where, deep in one
				<lb/>corner, crouching to examine a broken area in the
				<lb/>black floor, I found pure dark red clay, which was
				<lb/>the right consistency, moisture content and tex
				<lb/>ture to begin making a pot without further prepar
				<lb/>ation. I wondered whether this blackened room
				<lb/>could have been a kiln room. The clay, ready to
				<lb/>use, could have been dried near the kiln and fired
				<lb/>in the same place, a perfect set-up. An indoor
				<lb/>kiln might have also driven out the dampness, the
				<lb/>only aspect of the cave I found uncomfortable.
				<lb/>Considering the surroundings, I began to revise my
				<lb/>notions of the hardships of primitive life—at least
				<lb/>in this location. The temperature and quality of
				<lb/>the air, in spite of the heat outdoors, were far
				<lb/>superior to our air-conditioning. In one corner of
				<lb/>the cave, a constant trickle of water provided a
				<lb/>natural water supply. Fruits, nuts and herbs were
				<lb/>at the doorstep, and the scent of lavender filled
				<lb/>the air. The black crust of clay on the surface of
				<lb/>the "kiln" loft wall was thin; scratching through
				<lb/>it I came to a bright white, and began to make the
				<lb/>impresso patterns common to the area in Neo
				<lb/>lithic times. In a few strokes I felt one long hand
				<lb/>extending across time, sending a jolt of energy
				<lb/>into my body. I began my rituals.
				<lb/>The energy from the rituals seemed to puslate
				<lb/>from the vaulted ceiling to me and back again.
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb/>Aware of the privilege of having the cave to
				<lb/>myself, I felt like the center of the universe. My
				<lb/>mouth was actually inhaling the cave, all of it,
				<lb/>and breathing it out again. The cave contracted
				<lb/>and expanded with my rhythms, and shimmered
				<lb/>on its way back and forth. I made a pact with the
				<lb/>cave: it would tell me some of its secrets in ex
				<lb/>change for my rituals, rituals that it had not seen
				<lb/>for millennia. I in turn would learn some secrets
				<lb/>now and some later—l had only to listen, to keep
				<lb/>in touch.
				<lb/>The first stalagmite chamber to the front and
				<lb/>left of the great hall provided a natural altar, as it
				<lb/>was elevated a few feet above the floor and in
				<lb/>clear view from any point in the hall. In the center
				<lb/>of the altar stood a stalagmite the size of a large
				<lb/>Mother Goddess. Full-figured, she endured, frozen
				<lb/>through the ages but still in charge. In front of Her
				<lb/>and facing the great hall was a sloping stalagmite
				<lb/>the height of a table; behind Her, concealed from
				<lb/>sight, a small chamber divided into threes: a
				<lb/>hidden sacristy.
				<lb/>We poked around in the ground outside the
				<lb/>cave, the sun warm on our backs. Anne said,"
				<lb/>was in touch with myself today in a way that I
				<lb/>have not been for a long time. On the way back
				<lb/>down, we spent time in the deserted village
				<lb/>abandoned, we guessed, for lack of water. But
				<lb/>here again was magic; on a back path we found a
				<lb/>pomegranate tree in full bloom. The vineyards
				<lb/>originally cultivated by Humac villagers are still
				<lb/>harvested for their grapes and the fields for their
				<lb/>lavender, which was in bloom. The houses, made
				<lb/>from fieldstones piled one on top of the other
				<lb/>without mortar, grew as if molded from the earth.
				<lb/>Everything was in harmony. We continued to
				<lb/>come down with our physical bodies, but our
				<lb/>spirits were still high up there.
				<lb/>Note: After this day, and with encouragement from the
				<lb/>natives of Hvar Island, we located Professor Novak. Again
				<lb/>by word of mouth, we found his house in the town of
				<lb/>Hvar. He graciously allowed us to visit his observatory,
				<lb/>which he showed us with pride, and the visit ended with
				<lb/>gifts of shards and shells from the cave. Among scores of
				<lb/>artifacts, mostly bowls, removed from the cave or recon
				<lb/>structed from shards, there were two chalices in Professor
				<lb/>Novak’s observatory that were of particular interest to me.
				<lb/>Identically shaped, their form was so non-functional that
				<lb/>they must have been used for ritual purposes. They ap
				<lb/>peared to be very special; seeing them was like seeing
				<lb/>tangible proof of an ancient secret. I struggled to get a
				<lb/>photograph through the glass case. Chalices of this type
				<lb/>are referred to by Cimbutas as wine cups with phallus
				<lb/>stem bases, used when the Coddess of Vegetation was
				<lb/>born.. .[when) “caves were used as sanctuaries, particu
				<lb/>larly those with stalagmites and stalactites. (Cimbutas
				<lb/>notes that quartz caves were particularly selected to be
				<lb/>sanctuaries).

				<lb/>I document my rituals with a camera set on time release,

				<lb/>the ritual to spring from within. I start from a body posi

			<p>
				<lb/>through layers, trying to avoid the obvious, touching pri

				<lb/>Finding the Goddess: Finding Myself
				<lb/>Martha Alsup
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb/>have reason to believe the Goddess has been messing
				<lb/>around with my life. For me, She has firmly proved Her
				<lb/>existence: spinning out choices of madness or Her. l’m
				<lb/>not sure of Her design, or quite how to follow, but She’s
				<lb/>been leading me around and I strongly suspect She has
				<lb/>more up Her sleeve
				<lb/>try to trace back to the beginning of Her interference,
				<lb/>and it lands me inside my first memory. We’d gone to play
				<lb/>behind my Grandmother’s barn one evening, after a rain
				<lb/>A memory of sky in the puddles as a new-made rainbow
				<lb/>ribboned the earth. Stand still with wonder, trees in the
				<lb/>wind, shaking wet. That’s the feeling the Goddess still
				<lb/>tempts me with to get me to trust Her, and l usually do.
				<lb/>really have no other choice. She fashions things before
				<lb/>me, waiting to be found.
				<lb/>At this point, l’d like to report Her to the Patriarchy,
				<lb/>but they wouldn’t believe me. Besides, they’d probably
				<lb/>try to get at Her through me. Burn me or something
				<lb/>equally obscene. So l’II try to warn you, my sisters. The
				<lb/>reason l’m ratting is that She hurts. She’s left bloody
				<lb/>tracks in my mind. They make me want Her for comfort,
				<lb/>and just lead me deeper. Deeper and clearer, in a soft
				<lb/>light. But She stamps out the pattern with feet of cut
				<lb/>glass. She makes Her tracks bloody with my own pain.
				<lb/>The Accident. That’s what holds this whole thing
				<lb/>together, and makes me know it’s Her. The accident. For
				<lb/>me, that word is painted red. She did it, and I think I can
				<lb/>prove it was premeditated. There are several strong pieces
				<lb/>of evidence that point toward prior knowledge of a kind
				<lb/>that could only be Hers. l’II begin with the one most easily
				<lb/>questioned, and lead you out in the way She led me.
				<lb/>Carolyn died one summer evening. Another like me,
				<lb/>l’d thought, a woman grown to heal. I had just begun to
				<lb/>think of death, and now this spun me ’round. I watched
				<lb/>the dance her dying made, but couldn’t find her there. To
				<lb/>humor me, my collective said they’d bury me in the yard.
				<lb/>How to come to terms with it? It crept into my conversa
				<lb/>tion. I tend to think in themes and my friends saw this as
				<lb/>the latest. When my mother’s sister died I wasn’t too
				<lb/>surprised. Everyone I knew would die. The ending had
				<lb/>begun. A rather inauspicious beginning. You can see
				<lb/>further looking back
				<lb/>went to a cabin in the country with my lover, trying
				<lb/>to solve a problem among the autumn leaves. Susan had
				<lb/>drawn away, so we dropped acid to see what we'd find.
				<lb/>Down by the river we watched the leaves fall. Saw the sun
				<lb/>setting from the top of a hill. Then home through the
				<lb/>woods, admiring a dandelion dried in the sun. Turning to
				<lb/>look up at I saw Death’s face. Hold me, she said.
				<lb/>And I did. Terror that laced us up in a web. She'd heard a
				<lb/>car crash, and some woman scream. She was shaking and
				<lb/>Inever said how she’d scared me. We had to be one to
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb/>survive. But Susan got hungry and I didn’t feed her. When
				<lb/>she left for the icebox we both felt the rip.
				<lb/>A lover was down, leaving me with the wanting.
				<lb/>School would be through at the end of the year. Time to
				<lb/>stop letting others define me, bits and pieces all scattered
				<lb/>around. Say who I was and see what would happen.
				<lb/>didn’t have words, I told my collective, trying to explain
				<lb/>the hunger I felt. We must share process and not just our
				<lb/>answers. Let each other in and find our grounding here.
				<lb/>The Waterpeople—that’s what we call our collective—
				<lb/>freaked out, didn’t know what I meant. All but Susan
				<lb/>who knew the bond of our hunger. As we talked on she
				<lb/>brought out the book.
				<lb/>The Comforter, the story of what I really wanted. A
				<lb/>horrible man murders his lover. Tries to escape in a car
				<lb/>and crashes. After the wreck he wakes up in a strange
				<lb/>country—an island where the people are real. They all
				<lb/>feed each other—and live by their dreams. They take him
				<lb/>in and he learns how to heal.
				<lb/>Out to the airport to see my mentor. The book beside
				<lb/>me in the car. A butterfly net to see what would happen, a
				<lb/>test that l gave her, to pass if she could. It felt safe to be
				<lb/>with her—she made the land real. Once school was over,
				<lb/>we’d work it together. But she sought to explore the
				<lb/>depths of my mind and I saw her approaching with games
				<lb/>that I knew. I gave her the book over dinner—and then
				<lb/>left the airport. Never a word about what was at stake.
				<lb/>knew in the giving that she wouldn’t be there. I must
				<lb/>make rules ot my own
				<lb/>Center is slower so l eased to that lane. Cars would go
				<lb/>past me on the left side. The semi crossed over from the
				<lb/>right. No. No, it didn’t—but my memory’s that way. At
				<lb/>the top of the hill, he must have seen her lights coming
				<lb/>Pulled to the right and she hit me head-on.
				<lb/>The driver in the car beside me died with his prophesy
				<lb/>that l’d never live. Tangle of death spilled out on the
				<lb/>highway. Her web filled with cuttings —blown in the
				<lb/>wind. The rope that She threw me held many hands— all
				<lb/>come to find our way home.

			<p>
				<lb/>Waterpeople gathered together —for themselves and
				<lb/>for each other, people gathered around. The Goddess
				<lb/>went public —Kay Gardner dedicated her concert to my
				<lb/>getting well. Strangers were asked for prayers. I wandered
				<lb/>for weeks in time unremembered: I traveled through
				<lb/>words and came to my friends. The day the doctors said !
				<lb/>would die was the day I woke up.
				<lb/>Not the same. I had changed. She blotted all from view
				<lb/>but what She chose to show me, slowly so l’d learn. One
				<lb/>face. No peripheral vision—so if the person moved in
			</p>
			<pb n='101'/>
			<p>
				<lb/>closer, all I could see was an eye. The world slipped under
				<lb/>a microscope. In for close study, life at the root. l’d
				<lb/>forgotten how to choose between sounds. Everything
				<lb/>carried a life of its own. My left side blew in the wind, like
				<lb/>a leaf close to dying. All I remember is its being born. The
				<lb/>pain was so constant, it lost all its words. By the time
				<lb/>remember, thè first hurting was over, moving its way to
				<lb/>outside my skin. But someone must hold me or l would
				<lb/>fall. The path that I saw lay straight ahead. My neck didn’t
				<lb/>turn I couldn’t see ’round. No matter. Everyone loved
				<lb/>me. Persephone, once home, to go out no more
				<lb/>The fact that I didn’t feel winter was just a reflection of
				<lb/>life’s harmony. The world turned to crystal. To stay alive !
				<lb/>must move in the direction I saw by tracing out patterns
				<lb/>made by the feel. The Waterpeople took me home and
				<lb/>one by one all burned out. Susan was first. She had held
				<lb/>the flame of their loving. They gave me a home that was
				<lb/>free for the living and she felt its foundation rest on her
				<lb/>back. Felt she couldn’t touch me or the rest of her would
				<lb/>all drain away. Pain, shattered crystal, let me know l was
				<lb/>broken. I must look for the light in fragments I found.
				<lb/>Alone in that big house—a child’s distance from my
				<lb/>five parents as I watched them go to work. Staying home
				<lb/>—misbehaving—not going off to school. The hospital's
				<lb/>physical therapy—I should go to try. But trying meant to
				<lb/>hurt on purpose, with pain I could stop. I wouldn’t do it,
				<lb/>distressed my friends and made them pull away. Every
				<lb/>time they looked for progress, they saw me looking back.
				<lb/>The hospital held such pain; I knew it to be the mouth
				<lb/>of the trap. Packed with illusions and spewing out dam
				<lb/>age, housing the doctor who worked on my head. I be
				<lb/>lieved him when he said he knew nothing to heal me. Like
				<lb/>a leaf in the wind, my touching was fragile. Live by
				<lb/>death’s door and I mustn’t scream. Half of my brain lay
				<lb/>crushed on the highway. Now was the time to attend a
				<lb/>new birth. Going toward good feeling moved me out in
				<lb/>new spaces, leaving my mother, joining my friends. Brand
				<lb/>new child, filled with wonder, turning from death's
				<lb/>invitation because something else called. If survival didn’t
				<lb/>feel good, that meant I would die. My left arm answered
				<lb/>and swept through the air. I watched with the others as
				<lb/>the energy made my arm dance. Everyone had an opinion
				<lb/>— as if down in the cellar i’d found a strange bird. It
				<lb/>danced to the left, just where I wasn’t watching. There
				<lb/>was a crack to the left where things would fall out. A
				<lb/>place of surprises, a hole in the world. My arm moved
				<lb/>through space only others could see. Enough to feel its
				<lb/>lovely motion weaving round the crack. Left arm sews the
				<lb/>world together when I let it dance.
				<lb/>To be able to feel it, there was one cardinal rule. Lying
				<lb/>was out. It made two things out of one. I could only see,
				<lb/>hear, think one thing at a time. Lies confused me, they
				<lb/>tasted of death. But not to lie meant I must say it out
				<lb/>loud. Any idea that started to harden, I would set free for
				<lb/>the sake of space in my mind. Each moment carried its
				<lb/>own comfort— all I had to do was attend. Throw out the
				<lb/>rocks I found in my bedding and trust to the softness my
				<lb/>dancing arm made —light forming spirals just off to the
				<lb/>Out of time, yesterday had left me here. Constant
				<lb/>inner tremble so l couldn’t walk. Learn the speed of an
				<lb/>infant's run when life’s an endless day. So trusting con
				<lb/>nections, I danced with my friends. A moon to the orbits
				<lb/>saw their lives make. They talked to me from some other
				<lb/>planet. They’d come play for a while and then they would
				<lb/>leave — to worlds more important than passing the
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb/>moments. Cursed now to live on the edge of their lives.
				<lb/>Strangers I met seemed cut loose from fairy tales — come
				<lb/>to show me the space l was in.
				<lb/>
				<lb/>
				<lb/>
				<lb/>
				<lb/>Events seemed to happen in some kind of order, laying
				<lb/>a trail to find my way home. First New York to visit a
				<lb/>friend in the making. I met Diana before I was hurt and
				<lb/>we’d talked much of death. This visit to her was a part of
				<lb/>the pattern. A point on the Continuum, next thread in the
				<lb/>weaving. Almost a stranger—she took on that dimension
				<lb/>the moment she suggested I color my hair.
				<lb/>Henna. It was a strange bottle I found on her shelf.
				<lb/>Egyptian mud, good for the head. We both got excited at
				<lb/>the thought of it red. But back in St. Louis, it was just
				<lb/>another sign of my strangeness.
				<lb/>With my red hair I went off to a conference on Radical
				<lb/>Therapy. Friends were driving, but I flew ahead. Exhilarat
				<lb/>ing to be on my own, to have no one meet me to act as a
				<lb/>shield. Strangers there would not know about damage.
				<lb/>Thoughts of finding someone like me
				<lb/>At the Grand Hotel in lowa City, I followed the instruc
				<lb/>tions of the brochure. It said we’d be picked up at eight
				<lb/>o’clock. Color and balance came in with the roses. They
				<lb/>made three hours waiting seem one long rich moment.
				<lb/>Just before eight, hunger sent me to the dining room for a
				<lb/>"sandwich to go.” A woman in the room stood up and
				<lb/>waved. After checking out she meant me, I walked over
				<lb/>and she asked me to sit down. A mysterious stranger—the
				<lb/>feel of the Goddess, come in disguise. I felt a magical pull
				<lb/>and then thought—mistake. She was such a drag and kept
				<lb/>calling me "kid." Just another pigeon with the message
				<lb/>—go home. She asked my direction and found I didn’t
				<lb/>know it. Said that those radicals would eat off my head.
				<lb/>Don’t go, please to stay with her for the night. Go back in
				<lb/>the morning to all those who loved me—and learn to have
				<lb/>caution before the next flight.
				<lb/>really regretted my impulse to join her. I left her at
				<lb/>table and went to the lobby to find the right ride. But the
				<lb/>lady came up and pulled on my sleeve. Dón’t do it, kid.
				<lb/>Her mouth was tight. Something will happen, I just feel
				<lb/>like l know. This was the time to pull my trump card
				<lb/>wanting to take the words from her mouth. A few months
				<lb/>ago, I almost died, I said. I want to keep living until
				<lb/>there’s no choice. I know about death, she said, holding
				<lb/>up a two fingered hand. I have a strange disease you’ve
				<lb/>never heard of. My whole body is turning to stone. The air
				<lb/>in the room hushed for a moment. Still as a window to
				<lb/>some other world. Contact with Stonelady had shown me
				<lb/>the stakes of my choices. Went off to the conference with
				<lb/>no need for roots. Passing up drama, I went to the kitchen
				<lb/>and found chopping onions a most profound act. Life is so
				<lb/>easy among your own kind.
				<lb/>So many ways to heal. Into the season of acts of faith,
				<lb/>Istarted my own practice again. Thought to take up
				<lb/>where I had left off. Annie was shocked when she saw my
				<lb/>red hair—she remembered a dream full of fear. While
				<lb/>lay in a coma, she dreamed of a visit. Down to the hos
				<lb/>pital, a big, empty room—a screen with a picture of me.
				<lb/>had bright red hair.
				<lb/>Helping to heal, we talked on new levels. She made me
				<lb/>be honest with all that I knew. Annie spoke of her friend
				<lb/>who was dying of cancer—same side of the brain. Annie
				<lb/>carried our stories until he asked that we meet. It felt like
				<lb/>a summons, contrary to choice. I feel like l’ve known you
				<lb/>for all of my life, Tom said softly, just after we’d come.I
			</p>
			<pb n='102'/>
			<p>
				<lb/>could only stand and nod but we both felt the pull.
				<lb/>Another who knows the left side dying. Said that some
				<lb/>day l’d come back for a visit. That night, I knew it was
				<lb/>time.
				<lb/>But l had no last name or room number and Annie's
				<lb/>line was still busy. When I reached her she told me, he
				<lb/>was leaving the next day. His parents were taking him
				<lb/>home to die. We went back to the hospital next morning
				<lb/>at dawn, pulled by a power, a trust beyond reason. Where
				<lb/>were you, asked Tom. Last night was so awful. Theyre all
				<lb/>crazy animals. I wanted you to come and you didn’t. I
				<lb/>couldn’t get here by myself but I heard you call. We
				<lb/>shared his breakfeast for feelings that gave us. All know
				<lb/>ing the pleasure of taking what's good. It’s so important to
				<lb/>see all the leaving. Don’t let them hide the knowing from
				<lb/>you. To see clearly you’ll have to look through your pain.
				<lb/>It gets so beautiful when you admit what is real. To die is
				<lb/>no sadder than anything else. When I stood to leave,
				<lb/>knew we had met. Instead ot goodbye he gave me his hat
				<lb/>A bright orange knit hat had covered his shaven head
				<lb/>The feel of a helmet, protection—like in henna’s jar. As
				<lb/>long as l wore it, my head would be safe. Events kept
				<lb/>stringing together. Someone had thought my hair should
				<lb/>be red. A current of thought, a force that was larger. Who
				<lb/>do you think was messing around with my head? Witches
				<lb/>are known for their red hair all over the world. It tied in
				<lb/>with legends of strangers who came from distant lands,
				<lb/>strangers with red hair and blue eyes. There, you see
				<lb/>She’s at it again. It’s no wonder I thought my life had been
				<lb/>blessed.
				<lb/>Tom sent me a painting. That was important. The
				<lb/>painting was framed in the way of my looking. It hung on
				<lb/>the wall for when I could see. Taking a glance I first felt
				<lb/>afraid. Somehow, word of my magic hadn’t moved to the
				<lb/>Waterhouse. Susan, at center, was spinning me ’round.
				<lb/>All l really wanted was for Susan to love me. The fact that
				<lb/>she didn’t became a new koan. I couldn’t help wanting
				<lb/>her and knew that the wanting was what kept me out. But
				<lb/>wanting was feeling, an energy flow. I had to want Susan
				<lb/>to make my arm dance. New breakthroughs: breaking so
				<lb/>much I walked on cut glass. I wanted to leave, according
				<lb/>to schedule. Afraid, if I didn’t, I never would. Easy enough
				<lb/>to go back to school; a crippled whiz-kid who’s excused
				<lb/>half her brain. Clear, to stay here, there’s no happy
				<lb/>ending. Go in the direction of my dancing arm.
				<lb/>On the agenda of dreams made to order, a plan was
				<lb/>still held by my mentor. Beautiful lady in worlds full of
				<lb/>color. I loved how she sailed such sights from my soul
				<lb/>Knowing she loved me, showed I was good. If I could join
				<lb/>her, then I wasn’t broken. Healers together, keeping alive.
				<lb/>She’d been the Waterpeople’s credentials. She’d battled
				<lb/>my mother and she had won. Guiding me always through
				<lb/>a war of decisions, she seemed to know the rules of the
				<lb/>game. But our lives had gotten twisted around the event.
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb/>Summer and Mentor packed me off to Milwaukee
				<lb/>Lived by the lake in a castle-like house; her lover lived
				<lb/>with us and she was the star. I was to build my world onto
				<lb/>hers. Take up her practice where she left off. They’d fly
				<lb/>away and return for reflection, the heat of their living
				<lb/>made my only light. With summer’s passing, my mind
				<lb/>turned to crystal. I thought I must freeze not to loose
				<lb/>what I knew. No ground for my being kept me an object
				<lb/>on foreign soil. Left arm hanging down like a clipped
				<lb/>wing. I left the damn city, the first day of Fall. Take what!
				<lb/>knew and trust it to heal me. No way to make the next
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb/>moment safe. Iso
				<lb/>flinging off
				<lb/>rules.
				<lb/>Get up, out of the middle I heard a voice call. Stuck in
				<lb/>the middle, since I could remember. A family, this state,
				<lb/>this century. Get by with no boundaries. That’s how to
				<lb/>survive. Feelings. Magnets to sources whose endings were
				<lb/>dead. Be a Good Catholic Girl, or politico or shrink.
				<lb/>Change the answers to questions and follow the flow. The
				<lb/>only room I felt led out on the highway, drive to New
				<lb/>York, no need for a map. Stay in the present or the crack
				<lb/>would come open. Things falling out where I couldn’t see.
				<lb/>New York appeared a platform of safety—fly towards
				<lb/>outside and land on my feet. New. York was the world!
				<lb/>left, inside out. Here to begin, l’d come to the landing. It
				<lb/>seemed everyone here had just left the boat.
				<lb/>But back to St. Louis, prodigal child. A trial was
				<lb/>scheduled—on the subject of brain damage. No question
				<lb/>of fault —the woman had been on the wrong side of the
				<lb/>road. All that was left was to determine the extent of the
				<lb/>damage. Damage or magic? That was my question. The
				<lb/>roads of this journey, the truth would unfold. The Past
				<lb/>would provide the vision so that I could see who lwas.
				<lb/>Mythmaker, living a part of the tale. Go back to the trial
				<lb/>—then travel the country—follow a spiral knotted with
				<lb/>dreams. Travel the distance to an old point of view, back
				<lb/>to Grandmother who lay in bed dying. Join all the women
				<lb/>— over my mother’s head. Whisper to the old women, hei
				<lb/>mother’s name. Make me a name to roll off the tongue.
				<lb/>Mary Martha McGuire, say who l am.
				<lb/>Riding in Goldie, l’d skim the earth, picking up point
				<lb/>ers from friends where they lay. Connections l’d made l’d
				<lb/>paint on a mural. One rose in the sun, glitter paint for the
				<lb/>water, moon on the left. Maybe a bird on the back of the
				<lb/>van, to show that a nest could fly. Filled with junk from
				<lb/>all the unmoving, Goldie began this like a good scout. She
				<lb/>carried an old chair of my mother’s, dancing with clutter.
				<lb/>Isaid hold me and show me the vision I need.
				<lb/>Return to St. Louis but instead of answers — all ques
				<lb/>tions. All looking at me. Leaders of living had all gone
				<lb/>away. No one to judge the stand that I took, no one to
				<lb/>help me decide. My arm danced for the lawyer when
				<lb/>told him the truth. My trial was over, with my questions
				<lb/>for answers. Come to find out the planet is me.
				<lb/>In Goldie there was Pat in Florida, Pat in Mexico, Pat
				<lb/>who was the lover of the woman who had given The
				<lb/>Comforter to Susan. Pat with me in Texas, where I went to
				<lb/>see my sister. The threads of the pattern still weaving.
				<lb/>A member of family at Christmas, work the way back
				<lb/>in. This was to be the introduction of magic, the next
				<lb/>logical step towards going home. My sister was kind and
				<lb/>then angry at damage. When my parents wouldn’t talk to
				<lb/>me on Christmas, I saw what she meant. I couldn’t move
				<lb/>backward and so l leaned forward. Out to find Pat to
				<lb/>spend The New Year
				<lb/>A woman was with her, when I arrived at the house.
				<lb/>Mary, someone l’d already met. Then, she had told mel
				<lb/>gave her the creeps. She thought I could see through her.
				<lb/>As for me, that was fine. Sore from the cutting I felt from
				<lb/>my family, trying to tie my egg to a knot. They wanted to
				<lb/>trip and I decided to do it. Have someone with me, feeling
				<lb/>ot home. Went to a house in the country, where Pat knew
				<lb/>two women. Down by the river better to follow the light
				<lb/>of the day. Mary moved among trees, me trailing after.
				<lb/>With me, she felt a pain of her own. Each time I got
				<lb/>settled, she told me to move. She seemed to enjoy the
				<lb/>role that I gave her. Asking for safety and then l was
				<lb/>hounded. Heard her footsteps and took to the woods.

			<p>
				<lb/>One step at a time, the rhythm was walking. Feet
				<lb/>stroking earth’s breast in a dream. Follow the path of my
				<lb/>dancing arm. Tripping my brains out, brain-damaged
				<lb/>pervert, loose in the woods. Lost in west Texas, Iwalked
				<lb/>foreign country. Night started falling and the monster was
				<lb/>me. Too strange for Christmas, good Catholic girl, matted
				<lb/>to Mother’s nightmare. She slept while she dreamed that!
				<lb/>walked it alone. House on the hill had just turned its lights
				<lb/>on, thought when ! saw it l’d found the way back. Stuck in
				<lb/>fairy tales, l’d lost direction. From this point, home could
				<lb/>be anywhere.
				<lb/>Night had crept in, all the way to the fence. Go to the
				<lb/>house, they’Il find out you’re crazy. Strap a machine on
				<lb/>you and then you’ll survive. Approaching the door like a
				<lb/>penitent sinner. Beaten down cur, held at bay by a dog.A
				<lb/>boy turned to woman came out with her friend. She asked
				<lb/>me again where I wanted to go. But my mouth couldn’t
				<lb/>hold the sounds it should make. Pat’s name for a handle,
				<lb/>out with a stammer. I breathed when she grabbed it, she
				<lb/>knew I belonged. Other house in the country—for women
				<lb/>out flying. Come into the kitchen and wait for your
				<lb/>friends. Pat laughed when she saw me curled up in a
				<lb/>chair. Argument ended, the world could be trusted
				<lb/>starting with self. But I remembered trees cutting black
				<lb/>ness—showing me depths waiting below.
				<lb/>Before leaving Texas, I made a last visit. Passed
				<lb/>mother’s chair onto my sister; seat that had told me all
				<lb/>that it could. Grandmother lay dying, surrounded by
				<lb/>guards. Ileft Texas crying deep in my soul. Driving into
				<lb/>New York I was doubly careful. Try not to fall off eithei
				<lb/>side. Tired standing on the brim, but I mustn’t wander
				<lb/>Night’s edges are sharp. No one to blame but yourself if
				<lb/>you fall. Learn how to be here, out, up, on the ledge.
				<lb/>One semester of grad school and l’d have credentials.
				<lb/>Keep rhythm going through system of brakes. Prove
				<lb/>could do it—this ledge is by choice. People began to look
				<lb/>at me strangely, always, it seemed, l’d dropped from the
				<lb/>sky. I asked their location and they thought I was lost. Bag
				<lb/>ladies were comrades in this fading light. So mother was
				<lb/>right after all —being alive is too much to ask
				<lb/>On a trip to the ocean, I saw it all clearly. When the
				<lb/>sun lay gray on the water, I knew for a fact. The world
				<lb/>hadn’t changed and the pain was in me. A case of terminal
				<lb/>blindness—unless help arrived. Pity. Feel for the first time
				<lb/>this body’s sorrow. Hurting so long, not making a sound.
				<lb/>Take it for granted—left has more feeling. Right clenching
				<lb/>teeth, old broken jaw. Each cell in my body held in a
				<lb/>scream. Make another world for me out of what’s left.
				<lb/>got something I could touch and see and carry home,
				<lb/>covered in brown paper.
				<lb/>You can only see bubbles looking down.
				<lb/>BURSTING—take a drink.
				<lb/>Buy a machine. At first, the left side of my body had felt
				<lb/>like a balloon. Feeling came back like a mouth out of
				<lb/>novocaine. Like hair that’s electric, after the brush
				<lb/>My vibrator’s bright orange, same as the hat. Before,
				<lb/>orgasms had only happened by accident. First lady lover
				<lb/>had brought them to me. I squirted with laughter, to find
				<lb/>such release. Liquid feeling, I could hardly stand. Frozen
				<lb/>rod-like again, afraid of shattered glass. Seduce battered
				<lb/>body, down to the feet.
				<lb/>Inside had to see what outside was doing. Strange to
				<lb/>be meeting now. Before the accident l’d found comfort
				<lb/>looking—gazing into the mirror till I liked myself. A
				<lb/>method of greeting, across foreign lands. To go further,
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb/>needed some outside validation. Odds were just fair,
				<lb/>being broken, this would bring me to heal. Diana men
				<lb/>tioned an article she’d read. The true myth of Narcissus,
				<lb/>knew that was me. Ovid wrote the myth in Metamorphosis
				<lb/>— an old story, since distorted by the insurgents. But the
				<lb/>real myth has a different feel to it—about self-knowledge,
				<lb/>not self-love. Tiresias prophesied that Narcissus would
				<lb/>live to a ripe old age provided he never"knew" himself,
				<lb/>not if he never "loved" himself. Narcissus went to the
				<lb/>pool to quench a deep thirst. He looked into the water
				<lb/>and heard something melt with the knowing. The image is
				<lb/>The story’s about the process of change. All transfor
				<lb/>mations first feel like death. Death of who you once were
				<lb/>is included in the price. Becoming more than you now
				<lb/>are, knowing more than you now know, follows like a
				<lb/>flower, just as Narcissus bloomed at the edge of the pool.
				<lb/>To get this in motion, you need only look.
				<lb/>Enough to send me out on a brazen new experiment.
				<lb/>Down in the dark to face the poor monster l’d left in the
				<lb/>woods. Orgasm felt like energy rattling pieces of me in the
				<lb/>night. Brain-damaged cripple, I needed a watcher. Some
				<lb/>one to tell me if l haven’t come up. I went back into
				<lb/>therapy and rented her eyes.
				<lb/>The material world is holy I had to plug it up. My
				<lb/>mantra was moldy from three years hard using. Time to
				<lb/>replace it with many mirrors. Looking in mirrors, left
				<lb/>found the right, long awaited reunion. Hands crossing
				<lb/>over to match up the feelings. Each hand was holding
				<lb/>what the other side knew. Tom’s painting cleared to an
				<lb/>EYE. I couldn’t remember what had frightened me
				<lb/>My therapist said at meeting that she was surprised at
				<lb/>my chronological age. Color and light had gone out of my
				<lb/>world. It showed on my face I had tasted defeat. Pain
				<lb/>turned to anger and on its way out let me know l’d been
				<lb/>screwed. All of the pieces were flying together. Coming so
				<lb/>fast, they made my eyes spin. I went in from the ledge:
				<lb/>down, up, dn 'umop
				<lb/>towards compassion for self.
				<lb/>Being my body made me replaceable. Just cells inter
				<lb/>acting. There must be common channels, if I could only
				<lb/>find where to tune. Moon of the Mother, look for fine
				<lb/>sources; find the reflection and see your own face.
				<lb/>Now, think over what l’m saying. There may be a way
				<lb/>to help us get back. The medicine is dangerous, in which
				<lb/>lies its power. Stand before a mirror. Just keep eye contact
				<lb/>until you’ve said hello. Rest on the stream of feeling
				<lb/>flowing through your eyes. Know the safety of that place
				<lb/>where you ARE all change. Cry in your face—hurting
				<lb/>sorrow. Cross your hands and begin to touch —life starts
				<lb/>to flow. Masturbate to water roses, feel the color come.
				<lb/>Cross your eyes a new dimension. Vision of the Eye.
				<lb/>Twinkling lights dance over the surface. Through the
				<lb/>mirror to the other side. The Goddess is you, in your
				<lb/>image.
				<lb/>The gift of the Goddess is body to soul, soul to body.
				<lb/>Imagine the energy if we all looked at once. The Patri
				<lb/>archy could not stand such a blow. They took our bodies
				<lb/>away by forbidding the looking. They said we were
				<lb/>objects and they had the eyes. But they can never kill Her,
				<lb/>only try to get us to knock ourselves off. And we’ll never
				<lb/>do it. Her reflections are scattered through their dark
				<lb/>halls.
				<lb/>Remember the past. The Goddess grows restless. All
				<lb/>alone I can’t stand the heat of Her energy. Help me,
				<lb/>sisters. Look in the mirror.

				<lb/>Masks, Power and Sisterhood
				<lb/>in an African Society
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb/>Carolee Thea
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb/>European and eastern matriarchal traditions, rites and
				<lb/>art forms have been obscured and even obliterated, but in
				<lb/>certain areas of the world, women have managed to retain
				<lb/>much of their heritage and a measure of political equality.
				<lb/>The means have often been compromises —at a cost that
				<lb/>few of us can believe would be willingly paid. Yet western
				<lb/>women have paid the equivalent price without benefit. It
				<lb/>is important for us to obtain a perspective concerning the
				<lb/>matriarchal traditions of this unique and spiritual society
				<lb/>at a time when we are struggling to discover and create
				<lb/>our own.
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb/>The tribal societies of rainy West Africa still maintain
				<lb/>traditions developed over years ot experience in a harsh
				<lb/>environment. The secret societies of these cultures are
				<lb/>responsible for teaching social values and celebrating the
				<lb/>rites of passage. In effect, they are the perpetuators of
				<lb/>traditional codes. Among the Mende, Vai, Temne and
				<lb/>Sherbro tribes of Sierra Leone and Liberia, there are two
				<lb/>important secret societies: the Poro for men and the
				<lb/>Bundu for women.
				<lb/>It was through their art that 1 first learned about the
				<lb/>secret order of the Bundu women. Their masks intrigued
				<lb/>me. What does a masking tradition mean in terms of the
				<lb/>lives of the women in this tribal society? How do they
				<lb/>establish sexual identities and define the status of women
				<lb/>in short, how do they perpetuate a stable social order?
				<lb/>The Bundu is the only masked secret society of women
				<lb/>in all of Africa. It functions within what appears to be a
				<lb/>male-oriented culture concurrent with the Poro to main
				<lb/>tain a balanced social order. Through the mask, Bundu
				<lb/>women obtain power beyond that granted for merely
				<lb/>domestic functions. They may hold public office, even
				<lb/>that of Paramount Chief, and they are influential in gov
				<lb/>ernment and business decisions. Their presence and their
				<lb/>political acumen permeate most tribal activity, including
				<lb/>rituals, land distribution and marriage.
				<lb/>The Bundu, like other female secret societies, prepares
				<lb/>its young women for wifehood and motherhood and trains
				<lb/>them for various vocational activities reserved by tradi
				<lb/>tion for women. It is their access to a storehouse of secret
				<lb/>knowledge that places them on the same level as mem
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb/>bers of the Poro. This knowledge enables them tofunction
				<lb/>in important political and decision-making capacities
				<lb/>Not to be a member of a secret society is to be exclud
				<lb/>ed from important political and social decisions, as well
				<lb/>as group functions, knowledge and powers. Moreover, it
				<lb/>is only as a Bundu member that a woman may become a
				<lb/>leader. A succession of leaders are held sacred within the
				<lb/>Chapters. That the Bundu have their own founding an
				<lb/>cestors is vital. They are the intermediaries between the
				<lb/>people and Ngewo, the apex of the spirit world. He is re
				<lb/>garded as the ultimate creator from whom everything is
				<lb/>derived.
				<lb/>Initiation to the first level of the Bundu normally oc
				<lb/>curs at fourteen or fifteen. Kenneth Little adds that among
				<lb/>the Bundu, an older woman may also be initiated if she
				<lb/>chooses. However, initiation rites of female adolescents
				<lb/>usually occur at the beginning of menstruation or preg
				<lb/>nancy, at which time the initiates are taught by those who
				<lb/>are informed or experienced.? Moreover, the extended
				<lb/>Bundu training engenders both independence and a
				<lb/>strong sense of sisterhood by permitting girls to loosen
				<lb/>ties with their mothers at the same time that they make
				<lb/>new ties with other adult women of the community.
				<lb/>The initiatory sessions are announced by means of a
				<lb/>circular sent around in the form of a small piece of sokolo,
				<lb/>tobacco. Fees, money, cloth or other commodities are
				<lb/>due at this time. The number of initiates depends on both
				<lb/>local support and available teachers. Usually the enroll
				<lb/>ment is not more than thirty.
				<lb/>The first event of the initiation tests the girl’s commit
				<lb/>ment and will mark her for life. It will also deny her the
				<lb/>full knowledge of her sexual nature, for it is at this time
				<lb/>that she must submit to the partial removal of her cli
				<lb/>toris.* The denial of women’s sexuality is a patriarchal
				<lb/>practice the world over, but in this case, the sexual mu
				<lb/>tilation of women was probably introduced and enforced
				<lb/>by Arab conquerors.» By systematically ritualizing the
				<lb/>practice, the Bundu women have brought it under their
				<lb/>control. Yet custom prevents the cessation of the practice
				<lb/>and has further distorted its original meaning. It should be
				<lb/>noted that with much less power and perspicacity, west
				<lb/>ern women have submitted to mutilation by “modern"
				<lb/>medical men.1
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb/>*Female circumcision, including sunna circumcision, excision
				<lb/>clitoridectomy, infibulation and pharaonic circumcision are
				<lb/>mutilations that are still practiced in Africa. According to a
				<lb/>conservative estimate, it affects the life and health of 20 to 25
				<lb/>million women.

			<p>
				<lb/>During the first stage of initiation, the girls are kept
				<lb/>secluded, out of the sight of men and other uninitiated
				<lb/>persons. They are now admitted to the "sacred bush, the
				<lb/>Bundu school, and taught the lore, the songs and the
				<lb/>dances that mark important social and religious cere
				<lb/>monies of the tribe.
				<lb/>When the initiation wounds are healed, the second
				<lb/>stage begins. On a certain day, the initiates are taken to a
				<lb/>stream and washed. A cowrie shell, hung on cotton
				<lb/>thread, is then tied around their necks. This shell (a sim
				<lb/>ulacrum of the clitoris) is an indication of their sanctity
				<lb/>henceforth and must be respected by every Mende per
				<lb/>son. The initiates then enter the town in the evening and
				<lb/>dance, showing something of what they learned in the
				<lb/>bush. In accord with the evident puberty rites, the high
				<lb/>light of the occasion is a feast featuring a communal bowl
				<lb/>with a phallus made of rice.
				<lb/>After the public ceremonies, there is a private convo
				<lb/>cation at which the girls are sworn to secrecy concerning
				<lb/>Bundu ritual and knowledge. As part of the oath taking,
				<lb/>their heads are plastered in mud, and the washing off of
				<lb/>this mud signifies the attainment of womanly status. Led
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb/>by the chief Bundu woman, who invokes her ancestral
				<lb/>spirit, the proud initiates return in a procession to the
				<lb/>town. The next three days are spent on the verandas of
				<lb/>their parents’ houses, where they receive the admiration
				<lb/>of friends and relatives.?
				<lb/>With the attainment of this level of initiation, awoman
				<lb/>may commission a mask to be made. She chooses a carver
				<lb/>familiar with the rituals and symbols of the society and
				<lb/>tells him the name of the ancestor for her mask; he then
				<lb/>secludes himself in the bush to visualize the spirit that will
				<lb/>eventually inhabit it. The carvers are always men, in ac
				<lb/>cord with the tradition of strict division of labor.
				<lb/>However, the mask provides a perspective on the
				<lb/>initiated woman’s power. It is during the masked ritual,
				<lb/>private and public, that the Bundu appear so formidable.
				<lb/>They surround themselves with the exotic, the mysterious,
				<lb/>and the grotesque. This aura is confirmed by the visible
				<lb/>and invisible accoutrements of masks, costumes, dances
				<lb/>and sounds—or silence and secrecy. With all of these
				<lb/>means, the Bundu invokes the Goddess of the Mask, who
				<lb/>is called Sowei.° Sowei is the personification of all those
				<lb/>aspects of the ideal and powerful associated with Earth
				<lb/>Mother and Queen. She is clearly a cult object to be wor
				<lb/>shipped and revered by men and women. The iconog
				<lb/>raphy of the mask is material and sensual, which furthen
				<lb/>reflects this ideal.
				<lb/>The mask illustrated here is from the Sherbro Islands,
				<lb/>off the coast of Sierra Leone in West Africa. The basic
				<lb/>form of the mask, and others of its kind, is a bell shape or
				<lb/>helmet. The most prominent feature is the bulging ringed
				<lb/>neck, which suggests wealth, fertility and beauty.” This
				<lb/>aspect expresses the Mende equation of corpulence with
				<lb/>fertility and is reminiscent of Goddesses and female icons.
				<lb/>The forehead and cheeks are protruding and round, also
				<lb/>implying corpulence. Erich Neumann, in his book The
				<lb/>Creat Mother, writes: “One means by which early man
				<lb/>could represent the numinous magnificence and arche
				<lb/>typal uniqueness of the Feminine consisted in an expres
				<lb/>sive ’exaggeration' of form and an accentuation of her
				<lb/>elementary character””° (suggesting her fertility).
				<lb/>The slit eyes and closed mouth symbolize the fact that
				<lb/>the Bundu spirit never speaks. Her silence is equated with
				<lb/>power and judgment. When she wishes to communicate,
				<lb/>she does so through one of the lower members of the
				<lb/>Bundu, a Ligba.
				<lb/>The elaborate braided pattern of the hair indicates the
				<lb/>importance placed on this feature. Emblematically, hair is
				<lb/>power. The braid may be interpreted in the same mannen
				<lb/>as the entwined snakes found on the waist of the principal
				<lb/>Goddess figure at Knossos or perhaps in the same way as
				<lb/>the snake hair of the Gorgons. The snake, a lower earth
				<lb/>symbol of fertility, represents the Terrible Mother."1 Em
				<lb/>bedded in the hair of this mask are small phylacteries,
				<lb/>serving as both ornamental and totemic references to
				<lb/>Islam.1
				<lb/>The horns on the helmet are considered to have special
				<lb/>energy. The Mende and other African tribes believe that
				<lb/>horns are the repository of an animal’s power or life force
				<lb/>Horns are also tied around the neck or waist of children to
				<lb/>protect them from evil spirits.13, Tribal members believe
				<lb/>that they can psychically identify with a particular animal
				<lb/>and have access to its powers to protect themselves from
				<lb/>known and unknown spirits. The adopted object or animal
				<lb/>is called a "bush soul.
				<lb/>On top of the mask is a bird perched on a cup. One
				<lb/>interpretation is that the bird symbolizes spiritual tran
				<lb/>scendence. Another, specific to the Mende, is that this is
				<lb/>a Bofio, a bird that is said by some to receive messages
			</p>
			<pb n='108'/>
			<p>
				<lb/>ith the spirits.14
				<lb/>from the spirits and, by others, tot
				<lb/>The woman who commissions a mask decides whethen
				<lb/>it is satisfactory and then performs a ritual inviting the
				<lb/>spirit to enter the mask. Before the spirit can enter, how
				<lb/>ever, the Bundu costume must be complete. Raffia, dyed
				<lb/>black, is attached to the mask, and a cloth suit with the
				<lb/>sleeve ends sewn closed is worn over long black stockinge
				<lb/>and shoes. By completely covering her body, the dancer
				<lb/>prevents the spirit from entering her rather than entering
				<lb/>the mask.15
				<lb/>The masked dancer may carry a bunch of twigs or a
				<lb/>sword in her covered hands, and she points or gesticulates
				<lb/>with it. She never speaks, but may dance to the accom
				<lb/>paniment of the Seligura, a calabash rattle. Her move
				<lb/>ments include a rhythmic swaying and various arm ges
				<lb/>tures. If the dancer becomes hot and perspires, she may
				<lb/>remove her helmet and costume only it her face remains
				<lb/>concealed by one of her attendants, who carries a mat
				<lb/>specifically to hide the dancer’s countenance from view. 16
				<lb/>When the masked Bundu woman appears in public with
				<lb/>her musicians, it generally means that somebody (usually
				<lb/>a male) is going to be accused of an offense against Bundu
				<lb/>laws.17 The violator will be brought before the masked
				<lb/>woman to confront her ancestral spirit. Concealed by her
				<lb/>mask, the Bundu woman listens without reply, but she
				<lb/>conveys her spirit’s judgment through the Ligbas, the first
				<lb/>level members of the Bundu society.18
				<lb/>To move beyond a description of the aesthetic and
				<lb/>exotic is to consider the Bundu woman as a force in a
				<lb/>patriarchal society. Historically, African societies have
				<lb/>recognized female power. The Bantu had queens without
				<lb/>prince consorts. Independent queens ruled the Fanti on
				<lb/>the Gold Coast, which was the center of a matriarchy.
				<lb/>There were female rulers throughout the entire Zambesi
				<lb/>area in the northern Congo basin. In Togoland, the queens
				<lb/>had chieftains to help rule, but the latter could make
				<lb/>decisions only with the consent of a female council. The
				<lb/>West African matriarchy extended to the Atlantic Islands.
				<lb/>Helen Diner, in Mothers and Amazons, writes: "In the
				<lb/>oldest times, there were no reigning princes in Africa, but
				<lb/>the Negroes had great Kingdoms, ruled by Goddesses
				<lb/>These Goddesses had Priests and Priestesses who took
				<lb/>care of all government business in the name of their
				<lb/>sacred Mistresses."1
				<lb/>Mystically, African societies recognize female powers
				<lb/>as directly related to the fecundity and magic associated
				<lb/>with the earth. Further, woman experienced herself as the
				<lb/>subject and object of mysterious processes and as a vessel
				<lb/>of transformation and a mana figure.“ "Man marvels at
				<lb/>these mysterious powers in woman’s body, Simone de
				<lb/>Beauvoir writes
				<lb/>Like cattle and crops he wanted his clan to engender other
				<lb/>men who could perpetuate it while perpetuating the fertility
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb/>of the fields; all nature seemed to him like a mother; the
				<lb/>land is woman and in women abide the same dark powers
				<lb/>as in the earth. It was for this reason in part that agricultural
				<lb/>labor was entrusted to woman able to summon ancestral
				<lb/>spirits into her body; she would also have power to cause
				<lb/>fruits and grain to spring up from the planted fields. In both
				<lb/>cases there was no question of a creative act, but of magic
				<lb/>conjuration. Yet children and crops seemed nonetheless to
				<lb/>be gifts of the gods, and the mysterious emanations from
				<lb/>the female body were believed to bring into this world the
				<lb/>riches latent in the mysterious sources of life.2
				<lb/>That women were recognized to have this magical
				<lb/>creative ability constituted a formidable power base, par
				<lb/>ticularly in a society that was dependent on the continua
				<lb/>tion of traditions and lineage. Such unassailable power
				<lb/>surely inspired in men a respect twinged with fear, a
				<lb/>factor which ultimately must have contributed to the
				<lb/>domination ot women. Consequently, male masking may
				<lb/>have developed as a redress to what was perceived as a
				<lb/>social and spiritual imbalance. For the same reason, fe
				<lb/>male masking (among the Bundu), may have developed
				<lb/>after the conquest of patriarchal Moslems and the installa
				<lb/>tion of male power figures. Female circumcision and
				<lb/>phallus worship must also be outgrowths of this patri
				<lb/>archal takeover.
				<lb/>Clitoridectomy is an operation performed to rid wom
				<lb/>en of their “maleness,” (the clitoris being likened to the
				<lb/>penis). As Aristotle said, "If the clitoris is the seat of
				<lb/>woman’s pleasure, then away with it! Women are meant
				<lb/>to bear children; that she should draw pleasure from the
				<lb/>sexual act is unthinkable."22
				<lb/>Men disliked the idea that women enjoy sex because it
				<lb/>suggested that man was made for woman's pleasure and
				<lb/>not woman for man’s convenience. Thus, in removing the
				<lb/>possibility of sexual pleasure, patriarchs could be more
				<lb/>confident that women would remain sexually faithful. 23 *
				<lb/>Phallus worship may have been a feature of late matri
				<lb/>archy, while the male generative powers were celebrated
				<lb/>as a complement to the enduringly dominant temale role.
				<lb/>The recently excavated Goddess shrines in the Near East
				<lb/>reveal phalluses of all shapes and sizes (but these fetishes
				<lb/>may as well have been offerings of male devotees to the
				<lb/>Goddess in real or pretended rites of castration). During
				<lb/>the patriarchal takeover, this tentative sacrament was
				<lb/>appropriated and eventually made into a compulsory act
				<lb/>of homage.24
				<lb/>Among the West African Mende, a similar transition
				<lb/>can be noted, although through compromise its impact
				<lb/>has been systematically muted. Although the Bundu may
				<lb/>represent a vestige of the matriarchy, the Poro presence
				<lb/>and the rigidity of sex-defined tasks for women (primarily
				<lb/>domestic) suggest a negotiated arrangement. Even though
				<lb/>chieftancies can be attained by women, property remains
				<lb/>in the control of the male head of the family. Men may be

				<lb/>*Fran Hosken, editor of the WOMEN’S INTERNATIONAL NET-
				<lb/>WORK NEWS, recently returned from a six-week visit to 15
				<lb/>countries and 25 cities of sub-Saharan Africa, where she investi
				<lb/>gated the issue of genital mutilation of women. She talked to
				<lb/>gynecologists, midwives and pediatricians who confirmed that
				<lb/>these practices continue everywhere because no one speaks
				<lb/>against them. Furthermore, men often refuse to marry girls not
				<lb/>operated upon; in some areas, it is believed the operation is
				<lb/>required by religion and by the ancestors, and that women who
				<lb/>do not have it are prostitutes. It is said that the operation is
				<lb/>needed to preserve the family, and that excised women are more

			<p>
				<lb/>fertile. However, polygamy and excision have often been cor
				<lb/>related. In 1960, at a seminar on the "Participation of Women
				<lb/>in Public Life," the World Health Organization was asked by
				<lb/>the African participants to undertake a study of the medical
				<lb/>aspects ot "operations based on customs to which many women
				<lb/>were still being subjected." Subsequently, the Economic and
				<lb/>Social Council of the United Nations confirmed this request. To
				<lb/>date, no such Africa-wide study has been made.

				<lb/>polygamous, whereas women may have only one hus
				<lb/>band. Furthermore, some women, selected from the high
				<lb/>est order of the Bundu, are instructed in the rituals of juju,
				<lb/>or potent magic. However, female powers in juju are so
				<lb/>feared that women may use these rituals on few occa
				<lb/>sions. The secret societies of the Bundu women may be a
				<lb/>vestige of priestly sisterhoods, but the present division of
				<lb/>power, with the greater allocation accorded to the Poro,
				<lb/>is clearly the result of a desperate compromise.
				<lb/>Obvious questions arise not only about the terms of
				<lb/>the bargain struck between the Bundu and the Poro, but
				<lb/>also about the terms we ourselves will accept in establish
				<lb/>ing a complementary relationship necessary for our per
				<lb/>sonal, economic and political stability. One cannot think
				<lb/>of the sexual repression of women in the Victorian Age or
				<lb/>of the use of pom-pom girls at male sporting events in
				<lb/>the present day without realizing that western women
				<lb/>have been forced into unnegotiated compromises. The
				<lb/>Bundu women have retained the right to define them
				<lb/>selves in their secret and elite society. They act as instru
				<lb/>ments of divine revelation and have a command of potent
				<lb/>images, which are the repositories of sacred traditions. Al
				<lb/>this thev teach their daughters, along with self-respect
				<lb/>and sisterhood. But clearly, thev have lost the power to
				<lb/>experience the fullness of their sexual pleasure, and this
				<lb/>has been accompanied by the adulation of male sexua
				<lb/>energy.
				<lb/>If vou had to bargain for not simply vour life, and not
				<lb/>simply the lives of vour children, but the way of life for
				<lb/>vour daughters and granddaughters and all of their
				<lb/>daughters to come, what would vou bargain —vour polit
				<lb/>ical equality, vour economic equity, vour sexual freedom
				<lb/>or vour spiritual sisterhood?

			</p>
			<p>
				<lb/>This is the shrine of Oshun, the fertility goddess of the
				<lb/>Yoruba people. Her namesake is the Oshun River (which
				<lb/>runs below the main building) in the town of Oshogbo in
				<lb/>southwestern Nigeria. "Barren” women who bathe in her
				<lb/>waters and pray to her are said to become fertile. A nine
				<lb/>day festival is held once a year to celebrate Oshun. The
				<lb/>chief priestess dances in the massive (50-75 Ibs.) “helmet
				<lb/>mask, which is kept in the main compound.
				<lb/>The shrine was designed and built by Susanne Wenger
				<lb/>assisted by local masons and sculptors. Wenger, an Aus
				<lb/>trian, who has lived in Nigeria since 1951, is an Obatala
				<lb/>priestess.“ (Obatala is the Yoruba creator god.) Wenger has
				<lb/>built two other shrines (to Obatala) and fully incorporates
				<lb/>traditional Yoruba images and mythology in her work. The

				<lb/>She Who Bleeds, Yet Does Not Die
				<lb/>Rosemary J. Dudley
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb/>India is the only country where the Goddess is widely
				<lb/>worshipped today in a tradition that dates to the Bronze
				<lb/>Age (c. 3,000 B.c.) or earlier. Dressed and re-dressed, clothed
				<lb/>in space, skulls or sari, the Great Mother lives in both the
				<lb/>Great and the Little Traditions, changing, yet changeless.
				<lb/>The respect She commands at any moment provides a mir
				<lb/>ror for the honor and status accorded to women in the soci
				<lb/>ety which worships Her. Woman, as earthly manifestation
				<lb/>of Goddess, became in fact thi symbol of veneration pa
				<lb/>excellence because of her ability to provide the two prime
				<lb/>requisites for life from her own body —food and offspring.
				<lb/>That.
				<lb/>..earthly women could barely be distinguished from heaven
				<lb/>ly ones is shown in the following form of address used in the
				<lb/>epics: "Are you a Goddess? or a Danavi? a gandharva woman?
				<lb/>an apsaras, a yaksha woman, a snake fairy, or do you belong to
				<lb/>the human race?”?
				<lb/>History indicates that “mother-right organisation in other
				<lb/>civilizations may not have been so highly advanced and so
				<lb/>strong as was the case in India."3 This strength made it
				<lb/>necessary for the Vedic conquerors (1,500 Bc.) to apply ex
				<lb/>traordinarily cruel means to subdue Goddess worship
				<lb/>From the Indus Valley period, the Goddess went under
				<lb/>ground, not to emerge until the Gupta era (AD. 320-650).
				<lb/>One must suspect that the level to which women were de
				<lb/>based undoubtedly corresponds to the level to which they
				<lb/>had once been exalted.
				<lb/>How then did the Indian Great Goddess survive these
				<lb/>ruthless attempts of Her Vedic conquerors to rob Her of Her
				<lb/>power? The answer, as with many of the problems that
				<lb/>women faced, lay in the control and management of earth
				<lb/>as a sacred extension of Her own body. Fertility and, by ex
				<lb/>tension, agriculture have always been the special province
				<lb/>of women, both human and divine. Many scholars hold that
				<lb/>agriculture was the invention of women as they became
				<lb/>familiar with seed growth during gathering forays.3 Agricul
				<lb/>tural communities are most likely to be concerned with the
				<lb/>twin processes of production and reproduction. Through
				<lb/>mimesis (imitation), fertility of the land was attributed to
				<lb/>fertility of the woman:
				<lb/>..the female’s economic contributions were of first impor
				<lb/>tance. She participated—perhaps even predominated— in
				<lb/>the planting and reaping of the crops and, as the mother of
				<lb/>life and nourisher of life, was thought to assist the earth
				<lb/>symbolically in its productivity.
				<lb/>The Indus Valley Civilization (3,000-1,500 B.c.) at its two
				<lb/>largest centers, Harappa and Mohenjo-daro, had as its
				<lb/>source of wealth, huge granaries. The archeological record
				<lb/>shows that "no granary in the preclassical world [was) com
				<lb/>parable in specialization of design and in monumental dig
				<lb/>nity to the examples from the two Indus cities.”” Here, the
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb/>majority of statues uncovered are of the Mother Goddess or
				<lb/>of women.* [see illustration on pg. 113) Today in India, as
				<lb/>5,000 years ago, agriculture predominates. Eighty percent of
				<lb/>India’s populace still live in farming villages, isolated from
				<lb/>modernity. Every village has its Sapta Matrikas (Seven Moth
				<lb/>ers) and the majority of Gramadevata (village deities) are fe
				<lb/>male. Thus, due to strong patriarchal and pastoral pres
				<lb/>sures, the Goddess changed, but did not die
				<lb/>If woman and the Goddess were associated with the fer
				<lb/>tility of the earth and its seasons of cyclical growth, then
				<lb/>the first rites should have sprung up around these physiolog
				<lb/>ical cycles of women. The word “rite” itself may have de
				<lb/>veloped from the Sanskrit word “ritu,” meaning both “any
				<lb/>settled point of time, fixed time, time appointed for any
				<lb/>action (especially for sacrifices and other regular worship)
				<lb/>and "the menstrual discharge. .., the time after the courses
				<lb/>(favorable for procreation);.. sexual union at the above
				<lb/>time."? In Vedic days a woman, ten days after the onset of
				<lb/>her period, was thought to be "cleansed ceremonially and
				<lb/>physiologically, by the menstrual blood [and had taken al
				<lb/>...purificatory bath following the stoppage of the flow.”1°
				<lb/>Water, as a symbol of the amniotic fluid, would naturally
				<lb/>enhance a woman’s fertility. Originally, ritu was probably
				<lb/>the fixed time of sacred cohabitation with the priestesses
				<lb/>or apsaras — of the Mother Goddess, which presumably oc
				<lb/>curred in the rooms adjoining the Great Bath at Mohenjo
				<lb/>daro."' That the ritu was once a sacred time for cohabitation
				<lb/>and that we must have coined our word “rite” from here
				<lb/>seems conclusive.
				<lb/>In theorizing about the origin of rites and their connec
				<lb/>tion with women’s bodies, the question of "taboo” must
				<lb/>first be resolved. “Taboo” is defined as: “Set apart or con
				<lb/>secrated for a special use or purpose;... inviolable, sacred,
				<lb/>forbidden, unlawful."12 Bleeding women were certainly not
				<lb/>considered impure, nor were they the only persons under
				<lb/>the edict of ceremonial rules. Frazer cites “divine kings
				<lb/>chiefs...homocides, mourners, women in childbed, girls at
				<lb/>puberty... and so on””3 as examples of those held sacred
				<lb/>Clearly, what is attributed to these individuals and what
				<lb/>connects them is awe for their condition—power, not
				<lb/>morality. Again, Frazer says: "As the garments wbich have
				<lb/>been touched by a sacred chief kill those who handle them,
				<lb/>so do the things which have been touched by a menstruous
				<lb/>woman."1
				<lb/>Power—the power over life and death—is synonymous
				<lb/>with blood. A wounded person, suffering loss of blood, in
				<lb/>evitably weakened or died. The potency of blood for energy,
				<lb/>healing, purification, and sacred power is well documented
				<lb/>from prehistory onward. But if ordinary blood was deemed
				<lb/>powerful, menstrual and lochial (postbirth) blood must have
				<lb/>seemed twice so because of its association with birth as
			</p>
			<pb n='113'/>
			<p>
				<lb/>well as death. In fact, the ancient belief that menstruation
				<lb/>was a part of the same process as childbirth,15 was held as
				<lb/>late as the first century AD: "Aristotle, Pliny and other
				<lb/>naturalists. .. believed that the embryo is formed from the
				<lb/>blood retained in the uterus after the stoppage of menstru
				<lb/>ation.”16 Some scholars feel that the practice of marking
				<lb/>tabooed people with blood formed its origi
				<lb/>nal pattern from the principle of menstrual
				<lb/>and lochial blood being considered the
				<lb/>blood of life.”” Menstruating women wore
				<lb/>ochre to warn men of their tabooed state.
				<lb/>Today, in India, this is the mark of the spirit
				<lb/>ual adept.
				<lb/>Women’s sacred ceremonies of taboo
				<lb/>may be viewed as blood rites, based on real,
				<lb/>physiological changes like birth, consum
				<lb/>mation or menstruation. Unlike male rites,
				<lb/>they are not a symbolic reenactment of
				<lb/>birth, nor do they entail a sudden and often
				<lb/>violent break from the maternal or natural
				<lb/>world. Having inside oneself the potential
				<lb/>for birth and rebirth, one doesn't need an
				<lb/>imitation of it: Tat Tvam asi or "That Thou
				<lb/>Group female rites of passage are based
				<lb/>on changes in internal body rhythms, such
				<lb/>as the incipience of menstruation. Yet today
				<lb/>most initiations must be conferred individu
				<lb/>ally. Louise Lacey, author of Lunaception,
				<lb/>however, concludes that at one time al
				<lb/>women menstruated together—at the new
				<lb/>or full moon. It is now known that light con
				<lb/>trols the pituitary gland, which regulates
				<lb/>ovulation. Lacey’s theory is based on the
				<lb/>fact that artificial light is responsible for
				<lb/>establishing varying menstrual cycles1s—
				<lb/>thus necessitating individual initiations.
				<lb/>Nevertheless, a significant number of women today still
				<lb/>bleed at either the full or new moon, and women living in
				<lb/>close proximity soon experience synchronous menses. The
				<lb/>group character of early female initiations is described as
				<lb/>being:
				<lb/>...under the direction of their older female relatives (as in
				<lb/>India) or of old women (Africa). These tutoresses instruct
				<lb/>them in the secrets of sexuality and fertility, and teach them
				<lb/>the customs of the tribe and at least some of its religious
				<lb/>tradition. .. The education thus given is general, but its es
				<lb/>sence is religious; it consists in a revelation of the sacrality
				<lb/>(divinity) of women."
				<lb/>The fertility festivals still celebrated in India that often
				<lb/>culminate in ritual dances by women date back to the
				<lb/>Bronze Age, as is shown on one pot-sherd from Navda-Toli
				<lb/>(Mahesvar) c. 1,600 B.c. Girls today still dance this hataga in a
				<lb/>circle, holding hands.2° [see illustration on title pagel Women
				<lb/>dance together in Bengal in their worship of Gauri, the Corn
				<lb/>Goddess.21 Holi, celebrated to this day by bonfires, is thought
				<lb/>by some to commemorate the death by fire of a wicked
				<lb/>witch, known as the aunt of the boy Prahlada in the story of
				<lb/>Vishnu incarnate as Man-Lion (Narasimha).22 Once this holy
				<lb/>day (holiday) was celebrated in honor of Vasantasena, God
				<lb/>dess of Love and Spring—when the festival takes place. Dur
				<lb/>ing the festivities lascivious songs and dances are performed,
				<lb/>and red dye, symbolic of menstrual blood,23 is thrown on all
				<lb/>who venture out-of-doors. The newborn, carried by their
				<lb/>mothers once ’round the fire, are not considered pure until
				<lb/>this ceremony. Perhaps women originally celebrated their
				<lb/>own purification and personal transformations on these
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb/>occasions in the name of the Coddess
				<lb/>One of the most beautiful epithets of the Goddess re
				<lb/>flects Her sanguineous wonder: "She who bleeds, yet does
				<lb/>not die.” In accordance with this belief, the blood rites and
				<lb/>body changes of both birth and menstruation were held
				<lb/>sacred or taboo. These auspicious occasions called for re
				<lb/>treat to a sanctuary, or sacred space, often
				<lb/>triangular and symbolic of the womb.2 A
				<lb/>man might be warned "to avoid thereafter
				<lb/>the footpaths used by women or any other
				<lb/>place where he might encounter them."25
				<lb/>How awesome these bloody phenomena
				<lb/>must have seemed! Birth, with its ever at
				<lb/>tendant risk of death, must have seemed
				<lb/>especially dangerous. Despite some yearn
				<lb/>ing after the life-creating power of women
				<lb/>men probably felt fortunate to be excludec
				<lb/>from the mostly agonizing birth process.
				<lb/>Women, too, benefited from the seclusion
				<lb/>in terms of rest, recuperation, and immunity
				<lb/>from infectious disease. The Sanskrit word
				<lb/>for ceremonial "impurity” after childbirth
				<lb/>or miscarriage, "sutaka,” is closely related
				<lb/>to "sutika-gada, meaning "puperal sick
				<lb/>ness, fever or sickness of any kind super
				<lb/>vening of childbirth."26 Here is a clear con
				<lb/>nection between isolation and preventive
				<lb/>medicine
				<lb/>Birth, at one time, was entirely under the
				<lb/>province of women. Midwives, Indian and
				<lb/>otherwise, knew the herbal secrets both
				<lb/>for easy delivery and easy abortion.2 These
				<lb/>were women from the lower classes, mar
				<lb/>ried to barbers — the surgeons of their times
				<lb/>These women additionally supervised the
				<lb/>diet of the mother-to-be.28 Tsee illustration
				<lb/>on p. 114.
				<lb/>An Indian woman traditionally secludes herself for thirty
				<lb/>seven to forty-five days after her child’s birth, at which
				<lb/>timę she rejoins her husband. During this period she devotes
				<lb/>herself solely to her infant and her own recuperation. Often
				<lb/>she returns to her own mother’s home to give birth and re
				<lb/>mains there for some six months. After this time she and the
				<lb/>baby are given presents and then return to the mother's
				<lb/>married home.?
				<lb/>Two events occur on the sixth day after birth when the
				<lb/>danger to the health of the mother and child is over. The
				<lb/>first is the placing of an auspicious red mark on the fore
				<lb/>heads of mother and child by a woman believed to have the
				<lb/>power to bestow good fortune. The second event involves
				<lb/>the worship of Shasti, Goddess of Childbirth, and Her five
				<lb/>sisters. The paternal aunt performs this rite by throwing a
				<lb/>mixture of lime, red tumeric water, and grains of wheat onto
				<lb/>a stool covered with red and arranged with seven sacred
				<lb/>Pipal (fig) leaves. By doing so, she takes the luck or karma of
				<lb/>the baby upon her own head3°—a feat only a woman can
				<lb/>attempt. This entire night the females of the household
				<lb/>keep vigil, for this is the time when the Goddess enters to
				<lb/>write the child’s destiny on its forehead.
				<lb/>The color red has always been associated with sex and
				<lb/>fertility and, obviously, blood. Some say the vermillion fore
				<lb/>head mark, which is placed at the location of the regulating
				<lb/>pituitary, is reminiscent of blood originally shed in human
				<lb/>sacrifice.”? Probably it is blood more directly associated
				<lb/>with fertility since only the married Indian woman properly
				<lb/>wears it. Indian women, in fact, are traditionally married in
				<lb/>red! The Tamil word for Siva, consort of the Mother God
			</p>
			<pb n='114'/>
			<p>
				<lb/>dess, means "red” as well. Another of his names, Rudra, is
				<lb/>also synonymous with the word red.33 A red slip or wash has
				<lb/>been used from prehistoric times to enhance the life-giving
				<lb/>properties of terracotta figurines, a practice still current in
				<lb/>India today. Indian village deities are "coated with red pig
				<lb/>ment, red lead in oil, ochre, or cheaper scarlet colouring
				<lb/>matter. The colour is a substitute for blood."3
				<lb/>In an agricultural setting, a large family is highly de
				<lb/>sirable. In addition, many offspring were needed in ancient
				<lb/>times to compensate for the many who died young. What
				<lb/>first was woman’s crowning glory, however, became her
				<lb/>nemesis if she conceived too often, if she could not con
				<lb/>ceive, or if she brought forth solely daughters. Indian sons
				<lb/>were prized more highly than daughters after the time came
				<lb/>when only they could save their father’s souls from hell by
				<lb/>proper execution of the funeral ceremonies, and only the
				<lb/>birth of a son could save his mother from the fear of a sec
				<lb/>ond wife.35
				<lb/>Consummation was another body change haunted by the
				<lb/>awesome power of blood and was celebrated by ritual. Many
				<lb/>Indian accounts tell of a virgin who offers herself in a
				<lb/>temple to a stranger, or to a person especially appointed
				<lb/>to that task. Because the shedding of a woman’s blood
				<lb/>was no small matter, husbands or lovers who did not wish
				<lb/>to assume this responsibility could, through a surrogate,
				<lb/>avoid hymenal blood. No sense of shame was attached
				<lb/>to the temple fertility rituals, as temple "prostitution” was
				<lb/>a respectable Goddess custom which dated back to the
				<lb/>culture of the Indus Valley. Of the sacred rites taking
				<lb/>place in the Great Bath at Mohenjo-daro, it has been said
				<lb/>that "it was part of the ritual for men...to cohabit with
				<lb/>the female representatives of the Mother-Goddess to
				<lb/>whom the citadel complex belonged.”36 Another source
				<lb/>tells us that "there were nigh twelve thousand such priest
				<lb/>esses in Madras in quite recent times."3” Other accounts
				<lb/>supporting male dread and awe of hymenal blood include
				<lb/>the Santal decree which states that a girl “must once in
				<lb/>her life cohabit with a stranger in the temple of Talkupi
				<lb/>Chat."3’ The Nagas, a hill tribe, have a ceremony where a
				<lb/>marriage badge (tali) is tied around the neck of a young
				<lb/>girl after her first menstruation. Originally, this “tali-tier
				<lb/>was obligated to perform ritual defloration as well. 38
				<lb/>Menstruation, in many ways, is the most important of
				<lb/>all blood rites of passage, and marks the threshold of
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb/>womanhood, makes possible conception and birth, and
				<lb/>establishes a cyclic inner rhythm. The word menstruation
				<lb/>still retains its connection between Mena and the moon;3s
				<lb/>Mena being the mother of the Goddess Uma and the
				<lb/>daughter of Mt. Meru. In India, the lunar calendar, pos
				<lb/>sibly one of the first of its type, is still in use today. The
				<lb/>month is divided into two fourteen day periods: the dark
				<lb/>half and the bright half. The total of twenty-eight days is
				<lb/>both a menstrual and lunar cycle, with the full moon as a
				<lb/>cosmic representation of pregnancy, and the new moon
				<lb/>standing for the promise of rebirth. These beliefs are ap
				<lb/>parently universal, for the lunar markings found on pre
				<lb/>historic bone fragments are thought by many to represent
				<lb/>women's cycles.“0
				<lb/>At Mohenjo-daro many statues of the Mother Goddess
				<lb/>were found covered with a red slip, for Goddesses are sub
				<lb/>ject to the same physiological rhythms as their earthly
				<lb/>counterparts. In Bengal, a four-day ceremony called am
				<lb/>buvaci is held after the first burst of rain. During this time
				<lb/>the Goddess is considered to be menstruating in prepara
				<lb/>tion for Her fertilizing work to come. All farm labor comes
				<lb/>to a halt during this period." In the Travancore ceremony
				<lb/>called trippukharattu (purification), it is believed the God
				<lb/>dess menstruates eight or ten times a year. At these periods
				<lb/>"a cloth wrapped around the metal image of the Goddess
				<lb/>is found to be discoloured with red spots and is subse
				<lb/>quently in demand as a holy relic."” In Assam, the God
				<lb/>dess Kamakhya is worshipped by only a "yoni-shaped"
				<lb/>stone smeared with vermillion. ..During the new-moon
				<lb/>week Her shrine is closed to all”“ because this is the time
				<lb/>when the Goddess is believed to menstruate.“ In addition
				<lb/>to Bengal, Travancore and Assam, puritication ceremonies
				<lb/>are popularly celebrated in Changanur, Kerala, the Punjab
				<lb/>and the Deccan.“ In all of India the times when the God
				<lb/>dess rests and refreshes Herself may vary, but usually
				<lb/>these are associated with the new or full moon.
				<lb/>It is in the Tantric worship of the Mother Goddess that
				<lb/>the veneration of Her earthly double is most obvious. This
				<lb/>applies to Tantric beliefs concerning menstruation as well.
				<lb/>In one rite "a menstruating virgin is worshipped as
				<lb/>Sodashi."“ The Sanskrit word sodha means “purification,
				<lb/>cleansing...; correction, setting right."“ How different
				<lb/>this is from the later Dharma Shastra scriptural rule which
				<lb/>states that the sin of a monthly abortion accrues to a father
				<lb/>who delays in the marriage of his daughter after the onset
				<lb/>of her menses.“ A wasted ritu, or opportunity for concep
				<lb/>tion, had by then become the equivalent of a missed op
				<lb/>portunity for life. Tantra prescribes menstruation as the
				<lb/>best time for ritual intercourse from the woman's point of
				<lb/>view because, at this time, her "red' sexual energy is at
				<lb/>its peak."5° This sect considers “that menstrual blood is
				<lb/>not only invigorating but also sedative.”5' A woman’s body
				<lb/>is recognized to be allied to the phases of the moon. One
				<lb/>Tantric diagram shows:
				<lb/>a female figure illustrating positions of Amritakala, which have
				<lb/>to be energized on respective dates of the white and dark
				<lb/>halves of the month for successful tantric asanas (yogic
				<lb/>postures). The eighteen focal centres in the female body
				<lb/>mentioned in Ratirahasya”? can be excited by the adept
				<lb/>when harmonized with the exact location of the chandrakala
				<lb/>(digits of the moon) on [thesel respective dates.. 53 (see
				<lb/>illustration)
				<lb/>The antiquity of customs and rites may often be traced
				<lb/>through the history of tribal peoples in India who were
				<lb/>indigenous or who retained historical cultural purity
				<lb/>through their isolation due to the caste system. This is
				<lb/>evidenced by many noncaste peoples who continue to
			</p>
			<pb n='115'/>
			<p>
				<lb/>celebrate the onset of the menses as a joyous and festive
				<lb/>occasion. The main characteristics of these rites are:
				<lb/>"Seclusion in huts, pandals especially constructed for this
				<lb/>purpose, ritual baths, and a final coming-of-age cere
				<lb/>mony."5* Among the Pulayan or Cheruman, for example:
				<lb/>A girl’s first menstruation is celebrated with a certain
				<lb/>amount of luxury. The girl remains secluded in a menstrual
				<lb/>hut for seven days. A feast is arranged by the mother on the
				<lb/>first and last day. Seven girls accompany the initiated one,
				<lb/>bathe her in oil and water, and afterwards paint their faces
				<lb/>yellow.s5
				<lb/>Some high caste Hindus, especially in the South, also
				<lb/>celebrate female puberty rites. The Dikshitar Brahmins
				<lb/>enjoy processional and caste festivities5é while the Dehast
				<lb/>Brahmins seat the girl on a little throne, accompanied by
				<lb/>a maidservant. Female relatives pay visits, bring gifts, and
				<lb/>wash the young woman in perfumed oil.3
				<lb/>The Tantrics say that the menstrual discharge "is not
				<lb/>only composed chiefly of blood potent with ova-energy,
				<lb/>but also contains other properties, together with a large
				<lb/>amount of estrogenic substances (arsenic, lecithin and
				<lb/>cholesterol)."5° Scientifically, the existence of estrogen in
				<lb/>the discharge has been verified, along with the observation
				<lb/>that the blood itself is non-coagulatory.59 While in its idle
				<lb/>state in the womb, this blood is the purest in the body
				<lb/>The monthly occurrence of menstruation is once more
				<lb/>being seen in a more positive light. Certainly it is a fine
				<lb/>way of aligning oneself with the cosmic rhythms of the
				<lb/>lunar cycle. A new consciousness will be born when wom
				<lb/>en begin to note and record the date and time of their
				<lb/>very first lunar cycle. The concept of menstruation as puri
				<lb/>fication and cosmic attunement, rather than "curse," might
				<lb/>possibly engender a whole new response to the discomfort
				<lb/>some women now experience during their cycles.
				<lb/>It was some time after the first century B.c. that the high
				<lb/>regard given to a woman during her menses changed to its
				<lb/>opposite — denigration. Then and even now "women are
				<lb/>considered ceremonially impure during this period. Even
				<lb/>a Brahmin woman. . degenerates into a Chandali (out
				<lb/>caste)."6° Once considered a Goddess herself, today an
				<lb/>Indian woman during her period cannot even enter a
				<lb/>temple!
				<lb/>Currently, when rural women menstruate, they move
				<lb/>into huts set aside for the purpose of rest and seclusion.
				<lb/>Often they sit on broken earthenware pots. City women,
				<lb/>however, remove themselves to a specific area of a room
				<lb/>or part of a house and their look and their touch is re
				<lb/>garded with fear.
				<lb/>If women’s physiological functions were once the very
				<lb/>models and methods through which the Goddess was
				<lb/>venerated, how do we explain the fact that both were
				<lb/>divested so thoroughly of their power and influence? Some
				<lb/>of the theories for this loss of prestige have been postu
				<lb/>lated as follows: Discovery of the true facts of conception
				<lb/>(that males have a role in it), scriptural and mythological
				<lb/>suppression and interpolation, a worldwide cataclysm at
				<lb/>the end of the Bronze Age, the pacific nature of agrari
				<lb/>an societies, the preliterate nature of these societies or the
				<lb/>fact that their languages remain undeciphered even today,
				<lb/>and male control of women, their bodies, and all insti
				<lb/>tutions.
				<lb/>As the Great Goddess was stripped of Her sovereignty,
				<lb/>so, too, was the power of woman as Living Goddess, as
				<lb/>living ancestor, wrested from her. Split like the Goddess,
				<lb/>woman became a power divided against her own selt.
				<lb/>Today, though women’s rights are guaranteed under the
				<lb/>1949 Indian Constitution, the editorial consensus of a
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb/>survey taken by that government in 1974 is: “Large masses
				<lb/>of women in this country have remained unaffected by the
				<lb/>rights guaranteed to them.. "61 Since religion plays such
				<lb/>a major role in the vast majority of Indian lives, it is the
				<lb/>responsibility of concerned scholars —especially women—
				<lb/>to examine these changed myths and to reinvest such
				<lb/>sacred texts with the power of the Living Goddess. Hindu
				<lb/>law reformers, realizing that their scriptures and beliefs
				<lb/>were fluid and at times contradictory, used this broad base
				<lb/>as a means to change many restrictive social laws—often
				<lb/>involving women—by reference to older or interpolated
				<lb/>scriptural authority.
				<lb/>The sacred rites of the Goddess are the sacred rites of
				<lb/>women everywhere. With reclamation of this ancient
				<lb/>spirituality, women will sense the latent power of their full
				<lb/>potential, deriving both from the Goddess without and the
				<lb/>Goddess within. We need now to rejoin and reclaim both.

				<lb/>Deborah Haynes
				<lb/>One —Prologue
				<lb/>"We do not wish to speak alone. We demand that the
				<lb/>listener be a participant. We tell our secrets openly and
				<lb/>publicly without erasing them. We say, These are our
				<lb/>lives.
				<lb/>Where is the writing by women that extends itself
				<lb/>toward the spirit, that expresses the connection between
				<lb/>body and spirit, or feminism and spirituality?? Much has
				<lb/>been written about the Great Goddess in her mythic
				<lb/>forms: Kali, Athene, Virgin Mary or Kwan-yin. Her objec
				<lb/>tive tale has been told. What I desire to tell and to hear is
				<lb/>the story of our connection Now. This is my life and this is
				<lb/>my vision.
				<lb/>Two—Introduction
				<lb/>We are mulier and homo sapiens; our species has
				<lb/>undergone a long process of differentiation in which the
				<lb/>male-patriarchal-intellectual consciousness has dominat
				<lb/>ed. But now is the time for the re-emergence of the
				<lb/>feminine and feminine values, which include reverence
				<lb/>for the physical body, as well as for the planetary body we
				<lb/>inhabit. This is an attitude of participation instead of
				<lb/>control. For me, moving toward the feminine, toward a
				<lb/>spirituality which is grounded in (my) female experience,
				<lb/>has been a process of allowing a greater receptivity to the
				<lb/>unfolding present.
				<lb/>Three— Invocation
				<lb/>Out of experiences in the body, of the blood mysteries:
				<lb/>menstruation, pregnancy and abortion, let fuller connec
				<lb/>tions evolve between my body and sexuality and spirit, a
				<lb/>fuller awareness of my being as woman.
				<lb/>Let this writing be a ritual of mourning. To mourn is
				<lb/>connected to the Sanskrit and Avestan words meaning to
				<lb/>feel sorrow, lament, but also to remember. I am passing
				<lb/>through a time of mourning, of purgatory. Purgatory is the
				<lb/>midpoint between death and rebirth. It is the place of
				<lb/>making atonement. Atonement: reconciliation, comple
				<lb/>tion of what has come before. Change begins in aware
				<lb/>ness of its necessity, and not in deliberate and willful
				<lb/>attempts to change.
				<lb/>Four—The Story
				<lb/>Feminism begins in the self-consciousness of female
				<lb/>ness.3 Thus, I begin the story with a description of my
				<lb/>earliest perceptions and feelings. I am not aware of any
				<lb/>sense of restriction because of my sex before I was five
				<lb/>years old. I am the eldest child
				<lb/>In school, tne girls have a play house in the back of the
				<lb/>room. I am sent to that space as punishment. Later I am
				<lb/>outside, rather than inside the house, preferring vigorous
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb/>games like baseball, army, cowboys and indians bicy
				<lb/>cling and exploring in the woods, to playing with dolls
				<lb/>and learning to cook. I have a few dolls, mostly given by
				<lb/>my grandmother. I sew clothes for one or two of them,
				<lb/>but mainly the dolls stay on the closet shelf. Rather than
				<lb/>cooking and preparing food, I prefer the task of “official
				<lb/>taster” of the food my mother prepares. My father makes
				<lb/>her a yellow sign; a face with writing that glows: “Take the
				<lb/>Meat Out!" She chronically forgets, and we eat in res
				<lb/>taurants. I feel very special when I spend time with my
				<lb/>father in his basement shop. We fix the car and build a
				<lb/>stereo system and tinker and talk. Though I wear dresses
				<lb/>to school, they are tailored, contrasting with my younger
				<lb/>sister’s frills. My parents speak of me as the career girl.
				<lb/>am drawn to the paper boys, often riding routes with
				<lb/>them. This continues for a couple of years, until gradually
				<lb/>my relationship with one of them changes. I am kissed for
				<lb/>the first time, and I turn my lips away.
				<lb/>Ibegin to bleed; menstruation is an awkward word. My
				<lb/>mother buys sanitary napkins from the.male clerk, and l
				<lb/>stay in the car, embarrassed. Will I ever be courageous
				<lb/>enough to buy them myself? I want to wear bras and shave
				<lb/>my legs, yet resent the intrusion of pointed bras, hair
				<lb/>stubbles and increased self-awareness into my life. My
				<lb/>first sexual experiences are with Teri during our sleep
				<lb/>overs. But my attention turns rather quickly to boys: Teri’s
				<lb/>and my surreptitious experimentation is silently, but mu
				<lb/>tually, ended. I enjoy wearing loose clothes that allow
				<lb/>maximum freedom of movement.
				<lb/>At sixteen I begin my first sexual affair with a man. Our
				<lb/>sex couples intense fear and paranoia with the thrill of
				<lb/>touch. After two years of monthly pregnancy paranoia,
				<lb/>finally experience my undeniable biological vulnerability.
				<lb/>become pregnant at eighteen. I faint twice, and vomit in
				<lb/>the mornings. My period hasn’t come that month, and my
				<lb/>mother’s worn health encyclopedia comes to mind with
				<lb/>its descriptions of pregnancy symptoms.
				<lb/>In the midst of moving into the dormitory and regis
				<lb/>tering for my first university classes, I find out that I am
				<lb/>indeed pregnant. My timid question, "Do you know where
				<lb/>I can get an abortion?” is met by the doctor’s curt "No.
				<lb/>pick another doctor’s name at random from the phone
				<lb/>book and make an appointment. My question is again met
				<lb/>with a "No,” though I ironically discover years later that
				<lb/>another doctor in the same office has been performing
				<lb/>illegal but safe abortions for years.
				<lb/>don’t cry until my father calls. He says that now my
				<lb/>life is over, that it will never amount to anything, that he
				<lb/>is so disappointed. I wail and sob, feeling that I have
				<lb/>indeed destroyed something. He communicates to me
				<lb/>that now I am a total failure in life. I hate the bodily
			</p>
			<pb n='119'/>
			<p>
				<lb/>changes I am now experiencing: changes in my shape anc
				<lb/>size, breasts enlarging, thickening in the middle, stretch
				<lb/>marks on my breasts and thighs. I pay as little attention to
				<lb/>my body as possible.
				<lb/>Externally, the pregnancy goes very smoothly. I move
				<lb/>out of the dormitory at five and a half months, when few
				<lb/>people know that I am going to have a baby. I move into a
				<lb/>rooming house across the street from the hospital, and
				<lb/>live there for three months. I eat well and lightly, like to
				<lb/>sleep and draw and listen to music. I continue with
				<lb/>school. The boy-child is born a month premature, and my
				<lb/>labor is long and difficult. I want to die. He goes home
				<lb/>with adopted parents. I walk out with a friend’s assistance
				<lb/>after paying a fifty-cent fee.
				<lb/>The strain and trauma, the sense of failure and help
				<lb/>lessness in relation to my body, cannot be captured. The
				<lb/>aftermath of the birth is no less emotionally exhausting
				<lb/>than the pregnancy. A school psychiatrist advises me to
				<lb/>"stick it out," to stay in school for finals. This is the
				<lb/>second quarter of my first year in college. I know that
				<lb/>cannot continue as though nothing has happened. My
				<lb/>acute sense of loss and emptiness demands retreat and
				<lb/>rest. During the pregnancy l’d continued to live fairly
				<lb/>"normally, going to classes, taking tests, socializing, but
				<lb/>mainly being alone. After the delivery I need comfort and
				<lb/>support, and thus seek Alan, who has given much, even
				<lb/>though I refused to marry him and have the baby. He is
				<lb/>entering the Air Force in less than a month, and our visits
				<lb/>after the delivery are strained. The time is painful, and our
				<lb/>relationship ends when he goes to Denver.
				<lb/>Now that the pregnancy is over I begin a long process
				<lb/>of slowly paying more attention to my body, learning
				<lb/>about nutrition, being physically active, getting involved
				<lb/>in body therapy and practicing yoga. Living in my body
				<lb/>becomes increasingly important. After I stop using birth
				<lb/>control pills and two IUDs, I feel consistently afraid of
				<lb/>becoming pregnant again. Though I am using a diaphram,
				<lb/>Igive tremendous energy each month to this fear, to
				<lb/>wondering what I would do if. ..or how l’d get an abor
				<lb/>tion, since they have become readily available.
				<lb/>Ten years and two weeks from my first conception,
				<lb/>become pregnant again. I am able to schedule an abor
				<lb/>tion the day after my positive test. I have just turned
				<lb/>twenty-eight. I feel very tired, like l’ve weathered a long
				<lb/>storm.
				<lb/>The night before the abortion I encounter my irrational
				<lb/>fear in another form, fear that something will go wrong
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb/>during the abortion, but I meet that demon with written
				<lb/>affirmation: The abortion will be fine; I will deal with the
				<lb/>pain; I won’t fight the action of the abortion; I want this
				<lb/>abortion; the only way out is through my fear; I will en
				<lb/>counter my fear and breathe through it. I wear an Ameri
				<lb/>can Indian turtle fetish during the abortion, which, though
				<lb/>mildly painful, is over quickly. My cramps, which occur
				<lb/>for five days, are painful and frightening, and I cry easily,
				<lb/>but the days pass and my body heals
				<lb/>Five—Reflections on the Story
				<lb/>My pregnancy at eighteen was my birth. The labor was
				<lb/>very long and difficult and painful. I don’t even know
				<lb/>when the delivery was over, but my second pregnancy
				<lb/>and abortion ten years later tell me that it is. I am ending
				<lb/>a cycle of living in other people’s houses, both literally
				<lb/>and figuratively, of fulfilling other people’s expectations
				<lb/>During the ten-year interval I accomplished much, all
				<lb/>capable of doing whatever I choose to do. I have proved
				<lb/>myselt again and again. My abortion put me in touch with
				<lb/>my body on a higher level, with my sexuality and my vul
				<lb/>nerability, with the necessity of assuming full responsi
				<lb/>bility for my actions.
				<lb/>Now I must begin to live my own life. Yet, though this
				<lb/>cycle is ended, I do not clearly see the next one. To be
				<lb/>willing to wait, to see what is emerging, is the essence of
				<lb/>the feminine in me, and may also be the meaning of my
				<lb/>present purgatory. Perhaps the last ten years have been
				<lb/>the childhood of my psyche, my spiritual childhood.
				<lb/>Pregnancy, not as the birth of the Other, but as birth of
				<lb/>the Self. Abortion, from the Latin, to die, not as death of
				<lb/>the Other, but as death of a part of the Self, or death of
				<lb/>the old self.
				<lb/>Six—Beyond the Story: Entry of the Spirit
				<lb/>Lessons taught in the body lead to the spirit. The life of
				<lb/>the body is not synonymous with the life of the spirit, but
				<lb/>they intersect. Body intersects spirit in the spine, which
				<lb/>carries the life history of the individual. Through the
				<lb/>discipline of yoga I seek to widen that intersection, to
				<lb/>allow a greater dialogue.
				<lb/>The intersection of the body and the spirit is also
				<lb/>evident in sex. I express this relationship of feminism
				<lb/>sexuality-spirituality not as an absolute congruence, but
				<lb/>as one of significant influences and difficult demarca
				<lb/>tions. Sex is a force that connects essences. Sexuality is
				<lb/>the life force within us manifesting. Sex is a vital connec
				<lb/>tion to the Self, the Other and the Cosmos.
				<lb/>Seven—Prayer
				<lb/>To find a spiritual connection through the body simply
				<lb/>means to re-establish an awareness of the principles that
				<lb/>govern life, that are responsible for the ineffable ebb and
				<lb/>flow. I cannot name the principles; I do not grasp that
				<lb/>intangible essence. But life is handing me experiences
				<lb/>through which to recognize, with courage and vision, the
				<lb/>spirit at work. That recognition begins in the body.

				<lb/>2. Asl send this article to the magazine, I see that the December
				<lb/>issue of Sojourner has several articles on women’s spirituality.
				<lb/>lam glad to see others dealing with Spirit
				<lb/>This is a modification of a statement made by Lucy L. Lippard
				<lb/>From the Center: Feminist Essays on Women’s Art (New York:
				<lb/>Dutton, 1976), p. 6. She said, “Feminism, or at least the self
				<lb/>consciousness of femaleness, has opened...." I believe that
				<lb/>feminism begins in that self-consciousness.

				<lb/>Birth Dance or Belly Dance
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb/>Daniela Gioseffi
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb/>Few would link any positive idea of feminism with the
				<lb/>present-day phenomenon of the café belly dancer—as
				<lb/>sociated with that blatant sex object, the burlesque strip
				<lb/>per of our Western culture, as she accepts the dollar bills
				<lb/>thrust into her beaded bra and dance belt by the male
				<lb/>members of her audience. But, difficult as it may seem,
				<lb/>there is good reason to do so. Correlating the history of
				<lb/>the so-called belly dance with archeological evidences of
				<lb/>early matriarchal civilization, research into pagan wicca,
				<lb/>worship of the Earth Mother Goddess, and a study of
				<lb/>primitive obstetrics, I have come to the logical conclusion
				<lb/>that the belly dance, probably the most ancient form of
				<lb/>dance known to civilization, was originally performed by
				<lb/>women to celebrate, nurture and invoke her magical abil
				<lb/>ity to procreate at a time when giving birth to maintain
				<lb/>the species against depopulation caused by natural disas
				<lb/>ter was the most important thing a human being could do.
				<lb/>Prehistoric peoples, knowing nothing of the science of
				<lb/>birth and death, but only that humans are mysteriously
				<lb/>born and mysteriously die, probably viewed the muscular
				<lb/>contractions that expel the infant from the womb as some
				<lb/>awesome hocus-pocus of creation.
				<lb/>Though the instinctive ability to bear down and give
				<lb/>with nature’s contractions has been quite lost to modern
				<lb/>woman, one can imagine how a ritual dance to the first
				<lb/>deity, The Great Mother, would have imitated those mys
				<lb/>terious contractions, resulting in belly rolls, and possibly
				<lb/>shimmies, too, of the swelling breasts that fill so magically
				<lb/>with the milk that sustains newborn life.
				<lb/>Significantly, the present-day, café version of the
				<lb/>dance still features a portion known as the "tloor work" in
				<lb/>which the dancer, to a slower, more improvised rhythm,
				<lb/>descends to the floor, and, kneeling, leans back and
				<lb/>works her stomach muscles in a series of contractions.
				<lb/>theorize that this section of the dance, really its dramatic
				<lb/>climax, and traditionally performed in a serious mood
				<lb/>(the dancer refraining from smiling as she does elsewhere
				<lb/>in the dance), is probably the residue of an ancient rite
				<lb/>which either mimed or actualized the act of giving birth
				<lb/>as primitive women did, kneeling or squatting, in full
				<lb/>control of the muscles that force the infant from the
				<lb/>womb. This climax of the dance, which can also be asso
				<lb/>ciated with orgasm, as the climax of natural childbirth
				<lb/>often is, is followed by a faster, more joyous, upbeat
				<lb/>ending, which, in the Turkish style, still retains remnants
				<lb/>of a mime indicatingthe grinding of grain and the kneading
				<lb/>of bread, highly respected occupations of early vegetarian
				<lb/>matriarchates. The fertility dance, now viewed as a tourist
				<lb/>attraction in cafés from Cairo to San Francisco, from
				<lb/>Johannesburg to New York, is most likely the sexist con
				<lb/>version of a sacred ritual reaching back to a time when
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb/>birth was an ecstatic and publicly celebrated event rather
				<lb/>than a sterile and private horror locked away in a male
				<lb/>obstetrician’s "delivery” room.
				<lb/>In less Westernized corners of the Middle East, the
				<lb/>"birth dance” was still performed, at least as late as the
				<lb/>1960s, around a woman in labor by her fellow tribes
				<lb/>women. In this form, it was a ritual which men were not
				<lb/>allowed to watch—its purpose being to hypnotize the
				<lb/>woman in labor into giving with her contractions, thus
				<lb/>avoiding the pain of strained muscles. We don’t need to
				<lb/>be reminded that ours is one of the few cultures in the
				<lb/>world that expects women to go from fairly sedentary
				<lb/>lives into the strenuous labor of giving birth (equivalent to
				<lb/>running a six mile race) without adequate preparation of
				<lb/>the muscles involved. However, among primitive peoples,
				<lb/>there are many examples of therapy dances which involve
				<lb/>the pelvis and abdomen. Modern Hawaiians have probab
				<lb/>ly forgotten their "ohelo” hula, a dance which was per
				<lb/>formed in a reclining position for pregnancy therapy.
			</p>

			<p>
				<lb/>Even the dignified Spanish flamenco dancer, costumed in
				<lb/>her red and black peacock-tail dress, is related to the
				<lb/>oldest dancer of all, the birth dancer
				<lb/>Just as the American Blacks have had to rally around
				<lb/>elements of their common African heritage in order to
				<lb/>free themselves from a psychological sense of inferiority
				<lb/>bred into them by Waspish American cultural values, so
				<lb/>have feminists, both radical and nonradical, begun to
				<lb/>rally around their once suppressed cultural heritage in
				<lb/>order to free themselves of a sense of female inferiority. If
				<lb/>the so-called belly dance, which I choose to call a "birth
				<lb/>dance,” is an important element of that matriarchal heri
				<lb/>tage, and one, moreover, that has been thoroughly turned
				<lb/>around as a symbol of sexual bondage, then feminists
				<lb/>ought to be dancing it anew on the raised levels of their
				<lb/>consciousness, for each other, and not just as a seductive
				<lb/>entertainment for the amusement of men.
				<lb/>From the postglacial "Women’s Dance” of the Cogne in
				<lb/>Africa (c. 10,000 B.C.)—one of the oldest representations
				<lb/>of dancing—to the “White Lady of Auanrhet” (c. 4,000
				<lb/>B.C.) —a rock painting of a female fertility dancer found
				<lb/>in a cave in the Sahara—to the ancient Egyptian belly
				<lb/>dancers in the wall paintings of the burial chambers of
				<lb/>Thebes (c. 1420 B.C.)*, the timeless birth dance has been
				<lb/>persistent in its migrations down through the centuries.
				<lb/>have no wish, after all, to deny the wonderfully erotic
				<lb/>quality of the dance, but only to show how it relates to
				<lb/>the sublime eroticism of life in all its visceral glory, and
				<lb/>not to a smutty, narrow idea of sex born of a repressive
				<lb/>ethic that depends for its existence on the subjugation of
				<lb/>the female who, in the beginning, freely celebrated the
				<lb/>graciousness of Mother Nature as the giver of the promise
				<lb/>of redemption and resurrection, of new life and new birth.

				<lb/>9978: Repairing the Time Warp
				<lb/>and other related realities
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb/>Merlin Stone
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb/>After these many years of digging about in the
				<lb/>records of the ancient past, it recently occurred to
				<lb/>me that by accepting and continually confirming the
				<lb/>idea that we are living in the year 1978 (though we
				<lb/>take it so for granted), we might well be inherently
				<lb/>limiting our chronological perceptions and thus our
				<lb/>emotional and intellectual grasp of an important
				<lb/>part of the past. I wondered—if I began to date my
				<lb/>letters 9978, rather than 1978, would those who re
				<lb/>ceived them laugh at what they might assume was
				<lb/>my typographical error, or would they stop to con
				<lb/>sider that we might well be approaching the year
				<lb/>10,000 as likely as 2000? What a strange idea! What
				<lb/>does this have to do with the Great Goddess? Let me
				<lb/>explain.
				<lb/>Having grown progressively more aware of the
				<lb/>subtle but insidious effects of sexist language and
				<lb/>the power of naming (in the sense that Mary Daly
				<lb/>speaks of it), can we avoid eventually confronting
				<lb/>the hidden power and influence of a calendar sys
				<lb/>tem that informs us, daily, that ’our era' began one
				<lb/>thousand, nine hundred, seventy-eight years ago?
				<lb/>By accepting the idea that this is the year 1978, it
				<lb/>seems to me that our overall view of the evolution of
				<lb/>human development is being affected in a most
				<lb/>basic yet unquestioned manner. In fact, I suggest
				<lb/>that this acceptance actually perverts and distorts
				<lb/>our perception of the continuity and transitional
				<lb/>links ot human development in a most profound
				<lb/>manner. In the context of this issue, I would like to
				<lb/>consider how this annual dating system influences
				<lb/>our conceptions—and preconceptions—of God
				<lb/>dess, of the societies in which She was worshipped
				<lb/>and of the status and roles of women through the
				<lb/>many millennia in which She was revered.
				<lb/>A.D., as in 1978 A.D., stands for Anno Domini
				<lb/>The Year of Our Lord (Jesus Christ). Therefore, at
				<lb/>this point in time, we (people of all religions, as wel
				<lb/>as atheists) date our years from the year believed to
				<lb/>be the year of the birth of Jesus. All the years pre
				<lb/>ceding that year are generally referred to as B.C.
				<lb/>(Before Christ). A few scholars do use B.C.E. (Before
				<lb/>the Common Era), although they still utilize the
				<lb/>A.D./B.C. numerical order, and the Jewish calen
				<lb/>dar, though used primarily in a religious context,
				<lb/>records the current year as 5738. But the common
				<lb/>usage of the terms A.D. and B.C. is so extremely
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb/>widespread, almost universal, that for most of us,
				<lb/>this church-imposed division of time acts as a men
				<lb/>tal partition, separating all the years following the
				<lb/>"birth" of Jesus from those that preceded it. Al
				<lb/>though B.C. periods clearly encompass enormously
				<lb/>greater expanses of time, this temporal cleavage
				<lb/>seems to leave the events and people of even the
				<lb/>(relatively speaking) more recent B.C. periods,
				<lb/>somehow wafting away (backwards) into a vast
				<lb/>emptiness of the unknown or not quite real.
				<lb/>During the nineteenth century and even in the
				<lb/>beginning of the twentieth, many Bibles informed
				<lb/>their readers that the beginning of the world—Crea
				<lb/>tion—actually occurred in 4004 B.C. This informa
				<lb/>tion was provided by Archbishop James Ussher and
				<lb/>may still be found in the Scofield Reference Bible
				<lb/>printed by Oxford University Press. Yet, during the
				<lb/>last dozen or so decades a great deal of evidence
				<lb/>concerning periods labeled as B.C. has been un
				<lb/>earthed. This evidence has been brought to our at
				<lb/>tention by archaeological and paleontological ex
				<lb/>cavations, in conjunction with newly developed
				<lb/>chemical and electronic dating methods. To a great
				<lb/>extent, these relatively recent explorations were
				<lb/>made possible by the underlying permission granted
				<lb/>by the hotly contested theory of evolution as pre
				<lb/>sented by Darwin in his Origin of the Species. This
				<lb/>evidence has helped to date the emergence of homo
				<lb/>sapiens sapiens (people as we know them today) to
				<lb/>about 60,000 B.C. As a result, serious references to
				<lb/>4004 B.C. as the exact date of Creation—and the
				<lb/>idea that one man and one woman, Adam and Eve,
				<lb/>were the only two people on earth at that time
				<lb/>though once quite literally accepted by many peo
				<lb/>ple, even in our own century, have now become un
				<lb/>tenable, even somewhat humorously absurd
				<lb/>As the evidence produced by excavations in the
				<lb/>Near and Middle East began to accumulate, archae
				<lb/>ologists found that the techniques of ceramics, tex
				<lb/>tile making, metallurgy, architecture, the invention
				<lb/>of the wheel and of writing could be traced back to
				<lb/>what appear to be their earliest experimental begin
				<lb/>nings. Most important was the discovery that none
				<lb/>of these achievements showed signs of continual de
				<lb/>velopment before the initial appearance of agricul
				<lb/>ture. Discovering the past revealed that it was the
				<lb/>understanding and development of conscious
			</p>
			<pb n='125'/>
			<p>
				<lb/>agricultural methods, that original acquisition of the
				<lb/>ability to provide clans or tribal communities with a
				<lb/>relatively controllable, thus more generally avail
				<lb/>able food supply, that explosively triggered off the
				<lb/>development of most other aspects of human “civ
				<lb/>ilization.
				<lb/>It is now recognized that at some time between
				<lb/>9000 and 7000 B.C., the period referred to as Proto
				<lb/>Neolithic, this knowledge of agricultural process
				<lb/>originated and began to spread. By 7000 B.C. agri
				<lb/>cultural methods were in use in Jordan, Anatolia
				<lb/>(Turkey) and Iran. This earliest period of agricultural
				<lb/>development was of such great and underlying im
				<lb/>portance to cultural developments in other fields
				<lb/>that it was dubbed, by those discovering it, as the
				<lb/>Neolithic Revolution (though not a shot was fired,
				<lb/>nor an arrow loosed to bring it about).
				<lb/>At this same time, as a result of the new agricul
				<lb/>tural know-how, settled communities, small towns,
				<lb/>began to develop. The shrines, murals and statues
				<lb/>found in excavations of these earliest agricultural
				<lb/>towns reveal the presence of Goddess worship dur
				<lb/>ing this period. It is to sites of this period that British
				<lb/>archaeologist James Mellaart referst: “Art makes its
				<lb/>appearance in the form of animal carvings and
				<lb/>statuettes of the supreme deity, the Mother God
				<lb/>dess" (my italics)
				<lb/>These two features of the Proto-Neolithic period
				<lb/>—the earliest appearance of agriculture and the
				<lb/>existence of Goddess worship—are not disconnect
				<lb/>ed, for we later find that in cultures in which methods
				<lb/>of writing were first developed and used, it was the
				<lb/>Goddess, as Ninlil in Sumer, as Isis in Egypt, later as
				<lb/>Demeter in Greece (possibly Crete) and as Ceres in
				<lb/>Rome, who was credited with having presented the
				<lb/>gift of agriculture to Her people
				<lb/>Though the sculpted female figures of the Upper
				<lb/>Paleolithic period of about 30,000 to 15,000 B.C. are
				<lb/>quite likely to have been representations of the dei
				<lb/>fied Mother of the Clan—Goddess —this interpreta
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb/>tion is still somewhat controversial. But from the
				<lb/>Proto-Neolithic period, until the closing of the last
				<lb/>known remaining Goddess temples in the fifth cen
				<lb/>tury A.D., the worship of the Goddess is continually
				<lb/>archaeologically and/or historically attested. De
				<lb/>spite transformations caused by invading and con
				<lb/>quering patrilineal tribes, Goddess worship con
				<lb/>tinued in various forms and under various names for
				<lb/>at least 8,500 years. Its probable underground sur
				<lb/>vival during medieval, Christianity-proselytizing
				<lb/>periods of Europe may well have been the target of
				<lb/>centuries of witch hunts and mass burnings of
				<lb/>women.
				<lb/>Thus, if we are willing to accept a middle point in
				<lb/>the Proto-Neolithic period, and agree to agree that it
				<lb/>was at about 8000 B.C. that the brilliant and life
				<lb/>supporting discovery of agriculture was made
				<lb/>bearing in mind that in the earliest written records
				<lb/>this gift was attributed to the Goddess, not a god,
				<lb/>which strongly suggests that it was women (as the
				<lb/>food gatherers, rather than hunters) who first ob
				<lb/>served that barley, wheat and emmer began to grow
				<lb/>in and around the areas in which their gathered wild
				<lb/>grains were stored—and realizing that the oldest at
				<lb/>tested evidence of Goddess worship (so far dis
				<lb/>covered) occurs at this same period and that God
				<lb/>dess worship continued over 8,000 years and well
				<lb/>into the Christian period—why should we not re
				<lb/>claim at least these 8,000 years of our cultural
				<lb/>heritage as an integral part of “our era. By simply
				<lb/>adding them to the 1,978 years we daily acknowl
				<lb/>edge, we may consider ourselves to be living in the
				<lb/>year "ninety-nine, seventy-eight"—9978. Perhaps
				<lb/>this date is not as inclusive as 60,978 or 30,978, but
				<lb/>it is far from science fiction and certainly more cul
				<lb/>turally and chronologically authentic than 1978.
				<lb/>With this change we crash through the time barrier
				<lb/>of —B.C./A.D.—, gaining the so much broader
				<lb/>chronological perception that allows and encour
				<lb/>ages a deeper feeling of connection to women's
				<lb/>unique role in the Neolithic Revolution, the earliest
				<lb/>attested period of the religion of the Goddess, and
				<lb/>to eight thousand years of Goddess worship. If we
				<lb/>adopted this time designation by using it on our let
				<lb/>ters, papers and publications, we might remind our
				<lb/>selves, and others, that these forgotten or ignored
				<lb/>millennia occurred in real time, our time.
				<lb/>Consciousness raising over the past years has
				<lb/>made us painfully aware of the myriad and unsus
				<lb/>pected ways in which we, as women, have been
				<lb/>tricked into agreeing to the destruction of our dig
				<lb/>nity and self-respect. Isn’t it about time that we be
				<lb/>gan to acknowledge and reclaim this important part
				<lb/>of our heritage by explaining that, according to our
				<lb/>calculations, this is 9978!
				<lb/>Intellectually and emotionally perceiving that we
				<lb/>are within 23 years of the year 10,000 (let us, for the
				<lb/>moment, call it A.D.A.—After the Development of
				<lb/>Agriculture) brings and will bring many other
				<lb/>thoughts to mind. One that I would like to mention

				<lb/>change for those who have felt some confusion or
				<lb/>ambivalence about early religious training or family
				<lb/>religious identity and the seemingly new ideas of
				<lb/>feminist spirituality and the Goddess. Once we per
				<lb/>ceive ourselves to be in 9978, thus encompassingthe
				<lb/>period of One A.D.A. to 8000 A.D.A. as an integral
				<lb/>part of our era, those concerned need not negate or
				<lb/>refute the religious identity of their most immediate
				<lb/>ancestry (including perhaps two, three or even five
				<lb/>thousand years of the 9,978). But while accepting
				<lb/>these relatively more recent portions of ancestral
				<lb/>identity as worthy of consideration and self-esteem,
				<lb/>it becomes possible to simultaneously thrust furthei
				<lb/>back to periods peopled, not by strangers or aliens,
				<lb/>but by one’s own ancestors. Common sense tells all
				<lb/>of us that if we are here now, they were there then.
				<lb/>Extending our temporal consciousness of our ances
				<lb/>tral identity back to One A.D.A. (8000 B.C.), the
				<lb/>people who worshipped the Great Goddess, (which
				<lb/>includes possibly all people at that time and most
				<lb/>people for many thousands of years following it)
				<lb/>may then be regarded as another, equally real,
				<lb/>source of our ancestral identity
				<lb/>By reaching back beyond our forefathers, we may
				<lb/>rediscover ancestral foremothers who understood
				<lb/>the nature of a cosmic female energy font—Goddess
				<lb/>energy—foremothers who have bequeathed to each
				<lb/>and every one of us the inherent and inherited
				<lb/>knowl- dge of our direct connection and access to
				<lb/>that energy —a knowledge that is neither contrived,
				<lb/>taken nor borrowed—but that has been OURS from
				<lb/>the beginning.

				<lb/>Glossary
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb/>Some words have been included in
				<lb/>this glossary to provide supplementary
				<lb/>information but primarily we wanted
				<lb/>to demonstrate what has been aptly
				<lb/>called “The Power of Naming" with
				<lb/>the intention of reclaiming it. We
				<lb/>could choose only a small percentage
				<lb/>of the words that speak powerfully of
				<lb/>our past and of our potential.
				<lb/>Our main sources were: Webster's
				<lb/>International Dictionary Unabridgec
				<lb/>First and Third Editions, the Oxford
				<lb/>Unabridged Dictionary and Liddell &amp;
				<lb/>Scott’s Greek-English Lexicon, A
				<lb/>bridged, Oxford University Press
				<lb/>aegis (Latin from Greek aigis, aiz ’goat
				<lb/>skin.') Leather pouch worn like an apron
				<lb/>by Cretan priestesses, custom probably
				<lb/>adopted from Libya, where until recen
				<lb/>times women wore leather pouches in
				<lb/>which they kept oracular snakes. Hence
				<lb/>the archaic ’to come under the shielding
				<lb/>apron of is in modern English ’to come
				<lb/>under the patronage, sponsorship, aus
				<lb/>pices."
				<lb/>Amazon (Greek Amazon; usually giver
				<lb/>as a ’without' + mazos breast.') Legend
				<lb/>records that Amazons removed their righ
				<lb/>breasts to facilitate the use of the bow and
				<lb/>arrow. However, Zonë (in the Thracian
				<lb/>language) meant ’a woman’s girdle”; by ex
				<lb/>tension 'marriage or the sexual act, the dis
				<lb/>robing of a woman." Hence, ama suggests
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb/>’something lacking' + zone = ’a woman
				<lb/>whose girdle remains unloosened.” Greek
				<lb/>mythology records that after Heracles
				<lb/>killed Hippolyta, a queen of the Amazons
				<lb/>he stole her girdle. Zonë also was the name
				<lb/>of the capitol city of the Amazons in an
				<lb/>cient Thrace, (modern Bulgaria-Romania
				<lb/>to the Aegean and Propontus coasts.) One
				<lb/>of a race or nation of female warriors usu
				<lb/>ally associated with Scythia or Asia Minor
				<lb/>with whom the ancient Greeks of mytholo-
				<lb/>gy repeatedly warred; a tall strong mas
				<lb/>culine woman, a virago. Also see: Parthian
				<lb/>Anat, Anath Goddess who gave her
				<lb/>name to ancient Anatolia (modern Turkey),
				<lb/>later revered in Canaan. Her worship was
				<lb/>suppressed and inveighed against in Bibli
				<lb/>cal times. Ana is a universal name given to
				<lb/>women in all cultures, meaning 'risen,
				<lb/>heavenly. See: anatheme
				<lb/>anathema (Greek from ana+thema
				<lb/>upon+law [god); usually given as any
				<lb/>thing set up.’) Hence, a thing consecrated
				<lb/>to divine use; a votive offering, which in
				<lb/>Late Latin became anything devoted to
				<lb/>evil, curse. See: Anath
				<lb/>apotropaism. The science and art ot pre

				<lb/>which vary: 1) Excision of the clitoris, labia

				<lb/>genitalia. 2) Infibulation or Pharaonic cir
				<lb/>cumcision — After excision, labia are
				<lb/>scraped and sutured to close the female
				<lb/>introitus. This operation is usually per
				<lb/>formed on girls between the ages of four
				<lb/>and eight years to guarantee virginity. 3
				<lb/>Sunna circumcision—Removal of the pre
				<lb/>puce and tip of the clitoris, which must be
				<lb/>done by a skilled surgeon. Clitoridectomies
				<lb/>have been performed in hospitals through

				<lb/>heal (Middle English helen, possibly re
				<lb/>lated to helan Old English root for ’hell';
				<lb/>from Coth hailijan the same root as ’holy,

			<p>
				<lb/>While wandering through the Feminist
				<lb/>Wicce and seeing rows and rows of various
				<lb/>colored candles in the shape of female geni
				<lb/>tals (i.e. yoni) it came to me that the chris
				<lb/>tians (and others) have not been able to
				<lb/>eliminate reverence for female sexuality so
				<lb/>they renamed yoni and called it “the pray
				<lb/>ing hands." Then they can call it sacred.

				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>The Great Goddess Collective Statement
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>In putting together this issue on The Great Goddess/Women's Spirituality, we wanted to offer a holistic
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>concept of the Goddess and to move beyond an inside/outside duality. We also recognized a need to counter
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>the distrust that most women harbor towards religion and any aspect of spirituality because of the oppression
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>that we have all experienced from patriarchal religions.
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>During the year that we have been working together, our collective process has passed through several
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>phases. In the beginning we had meetings attended by 30 or more women, which required us to separate into
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>committees. The committee division continued to evolve and resulted in three main editorial groupings:
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>Personal/Ritual/Poetry/Fiction; Archaeological/Historical/Political/Theological; and Visual, which selected
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>material for submission to the full collective. Initially we attempted to create a review system so that everyone
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>could have an opportunity to see all submissions. However, some material could not be easily duplicated and
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>few people made the independent effort to look through the material from other committees. Because we were
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>committed to the concept of total collective energy and process, we held a marathon weekend on a Long Island
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>farm where more than 30 women met in a communal atmosphere to review and make recommendations about
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>submissions. Over the next four months the full collective continued to make selections and often reviewed
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>rejected material. Committees were engaged in editing, shortening long articles to fit within space limitations,
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>retyping, phoning and corresponding with contributors and soliciting material. During this intense period,
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>members often had to attend three and four meetings a week. Our numbers dwindled to about 20
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>In the next phase we reviewed the editing of accepted pieces and began layout and design of the magazine.
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>Because we were far behind schedule, a number of women who had worked hard were no longer able to give
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>priority to their involvement in the collective. Also only a few women were willing to become heavily involved
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>in production work. Some women pitched in; some women hung in; some women checked in. But, again,
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>throughout this phase all decisions were open to the full collective at specially arranged meetings. We felt that
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>we had to make an effort to respect the contributions of all without assessing participation. We did not want to
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>regard decision-making as a power
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>There was often muted and, occasionally, dramatic conflict. In a smaller group, confrontation and its
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>resolution would have had to be more directly resolved, but the size of our group permitted distancing and an
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>evasion of differences that sometimes left individuals antagonistically engaged or estranged. A basic source of
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>contention was our disparate definitions of the Goddess. Nor did we find an honest way to handle the implicit
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>and often explicit coercion involved in submitting our own work. Egotism about individual creations and their
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>significance/prominence flared. Our own inefficiency and ineptitude wearied us. The work was not equally
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>shared, although the decision process was. Decision-making in so large a group was extremely slow. Our original
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>committee division aroused factionalism. Members of committees felt that their subject matter was not being
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>fully respected by members of other committees and defensive attitudes developed. However, our slowness may
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>have achieved a greater fairness and even our factionalism may have clarified viewpoints that otherwise would
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>have been blunted by the consensus-voting process, and right to this moment, we have continued to challenge
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1_tl_45' n='N045'/>ourselves by seeking collective consensus on an infinitude of decisions. We feel that we tested the collective
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1_tl_46' n='N046'/>process and that that process not only produces the most representative work but also withstands the greatest
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1_tl_47' n='N047'/>stresses. Although our sharing must include the knowledge of how we were often divided against ourselves
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1_tl_48' n='N048'/>there were also many good times when we shared a heightened regard for each other, when we felt that we were
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1_tl_49' n='N049'/>touched by the Goddess.
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1_tl_50' n='N050'/>From the Heresies Collective
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1_tl_51' n='N051'/>HERESIES is an idea-oriented journal devoted to the examination of art and politics from a feminist perspective. We believe that what
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1_tl_52' n='N052'/>is commonly called art can have a political impact, and that in the making of art and of all cultural artifacts our identities as women play a
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1_tl_53' n='N053'/>distinct role. We hope that HERESIES will stimulate dialogue around radical political and aesthetic theory, encourage the writing of the
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1_tl_54' n='N054'/>history of femina sapiens, and generate new creative energies among women. It will be a place where diversity can be articulated. We are
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1_tl_55' n='N055'/>committed to the broadening of the definition and function of art
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1_tl_56' n='N056'/>HERESIES is structured as a collective of feminists, some of whom are also socialists, marxists, lesbian feminists or anarchists; our
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1_tl_57' n='N057'/>fields include painting, sculpture, writing, anthropology, literature, performance, art history, architecture and filmmaking. While the
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1_tl_58' n='N058'/>themes of the individual issues will be determined by the collective, each issue will have a different editorial staff made up of women who
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1_tl_59' n='N059'/>want to work on that issue as well as members of the collective. Proposals for issues may be conceived and presented to the HERESIES
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1_tl_60' n='N060'/>Collective by groups of women not associated with the collective. Each issue will take a different visual form, chosen by the group 
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1_tl_61' n='N061'/>responsible. HERESIES will try to be accountable to and in touch with the international feminist community. An open evaluation meeting
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1_tl_62' n='N062'/>will be held after the appearance of each issue. Topics for issues will be announced well in advance in order to collect material from many
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1_tl_63' n='N063'/>sources. Possibly satellite pamphlets and broadsides will be produced continuing the discussion of each central theme. As part of its
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1_tl_64' n='N064'/>commitment to the women's community, HERESIES provides workshops in all phases of magazine production and maintains the Women
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1_tl_65' n='N065'/>Artists' Slide Registry
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1_tl_66' n='N066'/>As women, we are aware that historically the connections between our lives, our arts and our ideas have been suppressed. Once these
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1_tl_67' n='N067'/>connections are clarified they can function as a means to dissolve the alienation between artist and audience, and to understand the
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1_tl_68' n='N068'/>relationships between art and politics, work and workers. As a step toward a demystification of art, we reject the standard relationship of
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1_tl_69' n='N069'/>criticism to art within the present system, which has often become the relationship of advertiser to product. We will not advertise a new set
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1_tl_70' n='N070'/>of genius-products just because they are made by women. We are not committed to any particular style or aesthetic, nor to the competitive
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1_tl_71' n='N071'/>mentality that pervades the art world. Our view of feminism is one of process and change, and we feel that in the process of dialogue
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1_tl_72' n='N072'/>we can foster a change in the meaning of art.

			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_3_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>In considering the already widespread and
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_3_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>increasing interest in the diverse manifestations of
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_3_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>Goddess spirituality within the feminist movement,
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_3_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>it may be helpful to clarify at least three emerging
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_3_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>aspects of this relatively new phenomenon. These
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_3_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>three aspects, of what may be the most unexpected
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_3_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>occurrence within the feminist movement, have 
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_3_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>developed, separately and together, in a rather incredibly
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_3_1_tl_9' n='N009'/> organic "grass roots" manner. Perhaps only
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_3_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>within the flexibility of a feminism that is continually
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_3_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>evolving out of the process of consciousness raising
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_3_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>in its truest sense has this outgrowth of feminist
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_3_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>consciousness been able to develop and grow.
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_3_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>Since all three of these aspects of Goddess 
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_3_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>spirituality appear to be simultaneously growing from
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_3_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>one central trunk, I drew lots (a method used at the
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_3_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>prophecy-providing shrines of the Goddess in 
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_3_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>ancient times) to decide their linear placement. This
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_3_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>placement in no way implies that one aspect is of
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_3_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>greater importance than another or precedes the
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_3_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>others in actual development and, as you will see,
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_3_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>many connections link the three.
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_3_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>The first aspect of Goddess spirituality is the
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_3_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>emerging interest in the history and prehistory of
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_3_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>ancient cultures that worshipped a female deity and
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_3_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>in the laws and customs of those societies. Through
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_3_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>research in archaeology, history, anthropology
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_3_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>and using this information to analyze ancient 
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_3_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>literature and mythology—we have begun to discover
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_3_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>that far from the generally accepted idea that the
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_3_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>Judeo-Christian religions rescued women from
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_3_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>supposedly more barbarian and anti-woman societies
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_3_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>women have actually lost a great deal of status and
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_3_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>physical and material autonomy since the inception
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_3_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>of these and other male-worshipping religions. As a
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_3_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>result of this research, which covers the period from
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_3_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>the Neolithic Goddess shrines of about 8000 B.C. to
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_3_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>the closing of the last Goddess temples in the early
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_3_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>Christian periods of Byzantium, we have learned
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_3_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>that many Goddess-worshipping societies were
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_3_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>matrilineal, matrilocal and matrifocal. In many of these
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_3_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>societies, women owned property, engaged in business
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_3_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>and held the highest positions of the clergy. In
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_3_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>such societies children automatically belonged to
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_3_1_tl_45' n='N045'/>their mother's clan and took their mother's family
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_3_1_tl_46' n='N046'/>name.
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_4_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>Through this research we are discovering the
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_4_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>roots of today's attitudes toward women's bodies
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_4_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>and minds. These attitudes become clear as we
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_4_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>study them within the context of the original institution
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_4_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>of patrilineal, patrilocal and patrifocal systems
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_4_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>under the aegis of the worship of a supreme deity as
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_4_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>male. Though it required many millennia to suppress
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_4_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>the Goddess religion and its social customs, this
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_4_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>ancient religion was eventually designated as 
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_4_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>"pagan" and its remaining vestiges were obliterated by
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_4_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>early Christian emperors, medieval inquisitions and
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_4_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>witch burnings.
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_4_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>In our growing interest and efforts to explore the
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_4_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>truth about the past, we are building, and hopefully
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_4_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>we will continue to build, a body of evidence that
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_4_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>bears witness to the many millennia in which the
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_4_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>Creator was regarded as female and in which women
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_4_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>held a much higher status than we have known since
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_4_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>that time. This aspect of Goddess spirituality within
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_4_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>the feminist movement is motivated by much the
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_4_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>same feeling that has encouraged us to rediscover
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_4_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>and reclaim female artists, writers, scientists, political
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_4_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>leaders and other important women who were
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_4_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>ignored by the writers of the history books with
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_4_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>which we were educated. This information affords
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_4_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>an entirely new perspective on current stereotypes
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_4_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>of women. It provides a broader view, as the

				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_4_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>with a feminist perception of spirituality and theology.
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_4_1_tl_32' n='N032'/> It has emerged from feminist consciousness, an
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_4_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>inkling or more of the first aspect and the perhaps
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_4_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>ever-present search for answers to such theological
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_4_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>questions as the possible purposes (or nonpurpose,
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_4_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>of existence, the true nature of morality (or im

				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_4_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>revealed in intelligence, intuition and reason. For
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_4_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>many centuries women have been taught that if they
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_4_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>cared to consider these questions at all (the implication
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_4_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>being that such questions were actually too
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_4_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>abstract for female minds), answers were to be
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_4_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>found in the words and writings of male priests
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_4_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>male ministers, male rabbis and male gurus —all of
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_4_1_tl_45' n='N045'/>whom supposedly had greater spiritually contemplative
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_4_1_tl_46' n='N046'/>abilities as well as more direct access to

				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_1_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>A feminist contemplation of spiritual and 
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_1_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>theological questions soon makes us painfully aware that
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_1_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>the answers with which we have so far been provided
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_1_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>have existed in close relationship to, or more
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_1_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>often within, a personified Life Force that is nearly
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_1_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>always linguistically, and more often actually,
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_1_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>considered to be of the male gender. Not too surprisingly,
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_1_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>"answers" about divine intentions are often as
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_1_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>male-oriented as the men who provide them. The
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_1_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>exceptional rate of growth of feminist concerns with
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_1_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>Goddess spirituality in itself reveals a level of
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_1_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>consciousness that refuses and refutes this
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_1_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>male-designed hierarchy and its appropriation of theological
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_1_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>and spiritual considerations—and the subsequent
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_1_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>divine" decrees.
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_1_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>So far, and let us hope in the future as well, 
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_1_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>feminists concerned with Goddess spirituality have 
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_1_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>seldom offered absolute or pat answers to theological
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_1_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>questions. What has been happening is the experiencing,
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_1_1_tl_20' n='N020'/> and at times the reporting, of these personal
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_1_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>or group experiences: how it feels to regard the 
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_1_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>Ultimate Life Force in our own image—as females;
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_1_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>how it feels to openly embrace and to share our own
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_1_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>contemplations and intuitive knowledge about the
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_1_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>role of women on this planet; how it feels to gain a
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_1_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>sense of direction, a motivating energy, a strength, a
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_1_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>courage—somehow intuited as coming from a cosmic
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_1_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>female energy force that fuels and refuels us in
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_1_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>our struggle against all human oppression and
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_1_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>planetary destruction.
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_1_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>Some say they find this force within themselves
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_1_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>others regard it as external. Some feel it in the
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_1_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>ocean, the moon, a tree, the flight of a bird or in the
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_1_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>constant stream of coincidences (or noncoincidences)
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_1_1_tl_35' n='N035'/> that occur in our lives. Some find access
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_1_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>to it in the lighting of a candle, chanting, meditating
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_1_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>— alone or with other women. From what I have so
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_1_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>far read, heard or experienced myself, I think it safe
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_1_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>to say that all women who feel they have experienced
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_1_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>Goddess spirituality in one way or another also
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_1_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>feel that they have gained an inner strength and
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_1_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>direction that temporarily or permanently has
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_1_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>helped them to deal with life. Most women interested
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_1_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>or involved in feminist concepts of spirituality do
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_1_1_tl_45' n='N045'/>not regard this spirituality as an end in itself but as a
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_1_1_tl_46' n='N046'/>means of gaining and giving strength and 
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_1_1_tl_47' n='N047'/>understanding that will help us to confront the many
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_1_1_tl_48' n='N048'/>tangible and material issues of the blatant inequities
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_1_1_tl_49' n='N049'/>of society as we know it today.
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_1_1_tl_50' n='N050'/>The third aspect of Goddess spirituality is
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_1_1_tl_51' n='N051'/>concerned with the more circumspect observation of
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_1_1_tl_52' n='N052'/>the organized male-worshipping, male-clergied
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_1_1_tl_53' n='N053'/>religions of today—an examination of the specific

			</p>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_2_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>maintained a secondary status for women. Involvement
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_2_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>in Goddess spirituality has encouraged us to
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_2_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>take a more careful look at the scriptures, rituals and
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_2_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>the gender of the decision-making level of the clergy
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_2_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>of the religions in which we were raised and/or
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_2_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>those that affect the society in which we live.
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_2_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>Some of the most urgent issues confronting
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_2_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>contemporary women all over the planet are those
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_2_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>concerning economic survival, abortion, contraception,
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_2_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>rape, clitorectomy, infibulation, divorce, attitudes
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_2_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>toward "illegitimacy", lesbian rights, social pressure
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_2_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>to marry and to have children, physical and
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_2_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>psychological violence, attitudes toward women's bodies
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_2_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>and the stereotypes of woman as follower rather
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_2_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>than leader and sexual and reproductive being rather
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_2_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>than as total human being.
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_2_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>A careful reading of the Bible still used by Judeo
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_2_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>Christian congregations reveals the ancient origins
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_2_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>of many of these important feminist issues. The
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_2_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>proclamation in Gen. 3:16 informs both women and
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_2_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>men that women are expected, as the result of a
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_2_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>divine" decree, to be sexually faithful and subservient
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_2_1_tl_23' n='N023'/> to their husbands and that the pains of child
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_2_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>birth are to be regarded as "divine" retribution —the
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_2_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>will of God" as it is asserted over the will of woman.
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_2_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>Deut. 22:28,29 requires that a raped virgin be married
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_2_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>to the man who raped her. Deut. 22:22-24 stipulates
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_2_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>that a raped betrothed woman should be put
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_2_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>to death (unless the rape occurred in the deserted
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_2_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>countryside). Deut. 22:20-22 states that a bride
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_2_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>discovered not to be a virgin should be dragged from
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_2_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>the house and stoned to death. Deut. 22:22 declares
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_2_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>that a married woman should be put to death if
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_2_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>found lying with a man (no excuse for rape is
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_2_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>mentioned). Deut. 24:1 decrees that a man has the right
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_2_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>to divorce his wife on his decision alone, while no
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_2_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>provision is made for a woman who desires to
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_2_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>divorce her husband. Each of these biblical laws
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_2_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>reveals the intense efforts made to control 
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_2_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>reproductive capacities, and thus the sexual activities of
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_2_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>women, by the men who wrote these laws and by
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_2_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>those who followed them.
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_2_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>Our understanding and analysis of these biblical
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_2_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>laws and their subsequent effects on contemporary
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_2_1_tl_45' n='N045'/>women become clear only in the context of historical
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_2_1_tl_46' n='N046'/>information which reveals that these laws were
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_2_1_tl_47' n='N047'/>devised at much the same time that matrilineal customs
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_2_1_tl_48' n='N048'/>were being destroyed and patrilineal systems
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_2_1_tl_49' n='N049'/>initiated. In a patrilineal system, knowledge of
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_2_1_tl_50' n='N050'/>paternity is vital. This knowledge takes on even
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_2_1_tl_51' n='N051'/>greater import when the system is declared to be an
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_2_1_tl_52' n='N052'/>integral aspect of The Divine Plan and thus any challenge
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_2_1_tl_53' n='N053'/>to the patrilineal system and certain knowledge
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_2_1_tl_54' n='N054'/>of paternity may be considered blasphemy—at
			</p>
			<pb n='6'/>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_1_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>times punishable by death. Even today, 
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_1_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>socio-religious attitudes toward "unwed mothers" and v
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_1_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>"illegitimacy" have not yet been thoroughly examined
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_1_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>and challenged as a vital feminist issue.
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_1_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>The institution and maintenance of a patrilineal
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_1_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>system were further abetted by biblical laws such as
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_1_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>Num. 30 requiring that a daughter's or a wife's vow
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_1_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>must be regarded as null and void unless confirmed
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_1_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>by father or husband—making it impossible for most
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_1_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>women to engage in business activities and thus 
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_1_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>limiting their access to economic autonomy. Num. 27
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_1_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>explains that the rights to family inheritance are 
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_1_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>accesssible only to sons, unless there are no male
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_1_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>heirs, and Num. 36 decrees that if a woman does
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_1_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>inherit in such a situation, she must then marry only
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_1_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>within her father's tribe. Written about 3,000 years
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_1_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>ago, these laws still exist in the Old Testament of the
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_1_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>Judeo-Christian Bible. Though the last few generations 
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_1_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>may have forgotten or rejected these laws, can
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_1_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>we afford to ignore them in our efforts to understand
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_1_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>the origins of attitudes toward women as wage
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_1_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>earners today?
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_1_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>Judeo-Christian laws and decrees have deeply 
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_1_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>affected the secular laws and attitudes of our 
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_1_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>contemporary patrilineal society. All too often we discover
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_1_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>them to be the probable origins of many of the problems 
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_1_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>we face today such as the right of each woman
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_1_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>to be able to control her own physical body and its
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_1_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>functions; access to abortion; in some countries, 
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_1_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>access to contraception and divorce; the concept of
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_1_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>"illegitimacy" and the social and legal pressures 
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_1_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>surrounding it; social and legal attitudes on lesbian
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_1_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>love; physical violence against women, stereotypes
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_1_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>of whore and madonna; double standards for 
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_1_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>premarital virginity and marital fidelity; attitudes toward
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_1_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>women's access to earning power (including choice
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_1_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>of vocation, education, advancement in chosen
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_1_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>field and levels of economic recompense) and the
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_1_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>so-called "natural" assumption of male leadership
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_1_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>in political, intellectual and spiritual spheres.
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_1_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>Each of these issues is an anger-provoking 
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_1_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>reminder of the longstanding power of male-oriented,
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_1_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>male-dominated religions. It is for this reason that it
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_1_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>is vital to fully understand the connections between
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_1_1_tl_45' n='N045'/>these attitudes, biblical laws and the initial institution 
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_1_1_tl_46' n='N046'/>of the patrilineal system in which we live. The
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_1_1_tl_47' n='N047'/>supremacy of "Father in Heaven" is a mere 
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_1_1_tl_48' n='N048'/>reflection of the supremacy of "father on earth". The
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_1_1_tl_49' n='N049'/>status of father is magnified beyond biological 
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_1_1_tl_50' n='N050'/>reality by the patrilineal system and it is this system
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_1_1_tl_51' n='N051'/>that is the underlying foundation of all patriarchal
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_1_1_tl_52' n='N052'/>ideas and actions. Refusing to acknowledge paternal
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_1_1_tl_53' n='N053'/>identity may be one of the most revolutionary acts
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_1_1_tl_54' n='N054'/>possible.
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_1_1_tl_55' n='N055'/>Even today, the absence or extreme minority of
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_1_1_tl_56' n='N056'/>women in decision-making levels of the clergy of
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_1_1_tl_57' n='N057'/>nearly all Jewish, Catholic, and Protestant congregations
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_1_1_tl_58' n='N058'/>ensures that these biblical decrees and 
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_1_1_tl_59' n='N059'/>subsequent attitudes will retain their original power.
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_1_1_tl_60' n='N060'/>Perhaps more important, we must remember that
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_1_1_tl_61' n='N061'/>biblical laws and attitudes have extended far beyond
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_2_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>the walls of any specific church or temple and are
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_2_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>now deeply embedded within so-called secular law
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_2_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>and social custom. Despite the supposed separation 
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_2_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>of church and state, women's demands in early
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_2_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>feminist struggles for women's suffrage were continually 
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_2_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>challenged and obstructed by clergymen who
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_2_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>claimed sole access to knowledge of The Divine
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_2_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>Plan—and women voting was not part of it.

				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_2_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>allowing "good" Christians to invade the land of the

				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_2_1_tl_52' n='N052'/>feminist consciousness, that same consciousness that

				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_3_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>ramifications for the feminist movement?
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_3_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>To answer these questions, we must first understand
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_3_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>the importance of religious symbols and rituals in human
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_3_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>life. According to anthropologist Clifford Geertz religious
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_3_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>symbols shape a cultural ethos, defining the deepest
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_3_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>values of a society and the persons in it. "Religion,
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_3_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>Geertz writes, "is a system of symbols which act to 
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_3_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>produce powerful, pervasive, and long-lasting moods and
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_3_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>motivations"" in the people of a given culture. A "mood
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_3_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>for Geertz is a psychological attitude such as awe, trust or
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_3_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>respect, while a "motivation" is the social and political
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_3_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>trajectory created by a mood which transforms mythos
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_3_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>into ethos, symbol system into social and political reality.
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_3_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>Symbols have both psychological and political effects be
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_3_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>cause they create the inner conditions (deep-seated 
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_3_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>attitudes and feelings) which lead people to feel com
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_3_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>fortable with or to accept social and political arrange
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_3_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>ments that correspond to the symbol system. Because
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_3_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>religion has such a compelling hold on the deep psyches
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_3_1_tl_45' n='N045'/>of so many people, feminists cannot afford to leave it in
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_3_1_tl_46' n='N046'/>the hands of the fathers. Even people who no longer 
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_3_1_tl_47' n='N047'/>"believe in God" or participate in the institutional structure
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_3_1_tl_48' n='N048'/>of patriarchal religion still may not be free of the power of
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_3_1_tl_49' n='N049'/>the symbolism of God the Father. A symbol's effect is not
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_3_1_tl_50' n='N050'/>dependent on rational assent, for a symbol also functions
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_3_1_tl_51' n='N051'/>on levels of the psyche other than the rational. Religion
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_3_1_tl_52' n='N052'/>fulfills deep psychic needs by providing symbols and
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_4_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>rituals which enable people to cope with difficult 
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_4_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>situations? in human life (e.g., death, evil, suffering) and to
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_4_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>pass through life's important transitions (e.g., birth, 
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_4_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>marriage, death). Even people who consider themselves 
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_4_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>completely secularized will often find themselves sitting in a
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_4_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>church or synagogue when a friend or relative gets 
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_4_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>married, or when a parent or friend dies. The symbols 
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_4_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>associated with these important rituals cannot fail to affect the
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_4_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>deep or unconscious structures of the mind of even a 
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_4_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>person who has rejected these symbolisms on a conscious
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_4_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>level—especially if that person is under stress. The reason
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_4_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>for the continuing effect of religious symbols is that the
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_4_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>mind is uncomfortable with a vacuum. Symbol systems
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_4_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>cannot simply be rejected, they must be replaced. I 
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_4_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>believe where there is no replacement, the mind will revert
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_4_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>to familiar structures at times of crisis, bafflement or

				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_4_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>God. Her mood is one of trust in male power as salvific

				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_2_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>discussion, let me briefly identify the sources for the

				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_2_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>of traditions but their attitudes toward these traditions are
				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_2_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>eclectic and selective. Ancient traditions are filtered
				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_2_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>through modern experience and there is no sense that
				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_2_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>every aspect of ancient or culturally distant religious 
				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_2_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>consciousness must be adopted as whole cloth.
				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_2_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>At the simplest and most basic level, the symbol of
				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_2_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>Goddess is an acknowledgment of the legitimacy of 
				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_2_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>female power as a beneficent and independent power. A
				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_2_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>woman who echoes Ntosake Shange's dramatic statement,
				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_2_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>"I found God in myself and I loved her fiercely, is
				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_2_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>saying, "Female power is strong and creative." She is saying
				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_2_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>that the divine principle, the saving and sustaining
				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_2_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>power, is in herself, that she will no longer look to men or
				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_2_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>male figures as saviors. This meaning of the symbol of
				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_2_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>Goddess is simple and obvious, and yet it is difficult for
				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_2_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>many to comprehend. It stands in sharp contrast to the
				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_2_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>paradigms of female dependence on males which have
				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_2_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>been predominant in our culture. The internationally ac
				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_2_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>claimed French novelist Monique Wittig captured 
				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_2_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>something of the novelty and flavor of the affirmation of 
				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_2_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>female power when she wrote in her mythic work Les
				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_2_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>Cuérillères:

				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_1_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>of female power. For one raised in the West, a
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_1_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>question immediately arises, "Is the Goddess simply 
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_1_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>female power writ large, and if so, why bother with the 
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_1_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>symbol 'Goddess' at all? Or do you really mean to refer to a
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_1_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>Goddess 'out there' who is not reducible to a human
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_1_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>potential?" Many women have rediscovered the power of
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_1_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>Goddess in solitude as a result of their own inner quests,
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_1_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>or with other women through the women's spirituality
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_1_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>movement; their answers to this question vary. Three
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_1_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>meanings attach to the symbol "Goddess" for these women:
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_1_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>(1) the Goddess as divine female, as personification
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_1_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>who can be invoked in prayer and ritual; (2) the Goddess
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_1_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>as symbol of the life, death and rebirth energy in nature
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_1_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>and culture, in personal and communal life; (3) the God
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_1_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>dess as affirmation of the legitimacy and beauty of female
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_1_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>power (made possible by the new becoming of women in
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_1_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>the women's liberation movement). If one were to ask the
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_1_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>women who participate in the symbol of Goddess which
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_1_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>of these meanings is the "correct" one, different responses
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_1_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>would be given. Some would assert that the Goddess is
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_1_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>definitely not "out there," that the symbol of a divinity
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_1_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>"out there" is part of the legacy of patriarchal oppression,
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_1_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>which brings with it the authoritarianism, hierarchicalism
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_1_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>and dogmatic rigidity associated with Biblical 
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_1_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>monotheistic religions. They might argue that the symbol of
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_1_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>Goddess reflects the sacred power within women and
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_1_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>nature, suggesting the connectedness between women's
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_1_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>cycles of menstruation, birth and menopause and the life
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_1_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>and death cycles of the universe. Others seem quite 
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_1_1_tl_45' n='N045'/>comfortable with the notion of Goddess as a divine female
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_1_1_tl_46' n='N046'/>protector and creator and would find their experience of
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_1_1_tl_47' n='N047'/>Goddess limited by the assertion that she is not also out

				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_1_1_tl_49' n='N049'/>processes. When asked what the symbol of Goddess
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_1_1_tl_50' n='N050'/>meant, feminist witch Starhawk replied, "It all depends

				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_1_1_tl_55' n='N055'/>such a statement? Theologians would call these the
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_1_1_tl_56' n='N056'/>words of a sloppy thinker. But my deepest intuition tells
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_1_1_tl_57' n='N057'/>me they contain a wisdom Western theological thought
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_1_1_tl_58' n='N058'/>has lost.
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_1_1_tl_59' n='N059'/>To one trained in theology these differing views of the
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_1_1_tl_60' n='N060'/>"meaning" of the symbol of Goddess sound like an 
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_1_1_tl_61' n='N061'/>incipient Trinitarian controversy. Is there, I wonder, a way of
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_1_1_tl_62' n='N062'/>developing a theology that does not lead into dogmatic
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_1_1_tl_63' n='N063'/>controversy or require us to say definitively that one 
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_1_1_tl_64' n='N064'/>understanding is true and the others false? Could we possibly
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_1_1_tl_65' n='N065'/>share our common relation to the symbol and make that
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_1_1_tl_66' n='N066'/>primary and yet allow our varying interpretations? The
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_1_1_tl_67' n='N067'/>diverse explications of the symbol "Goddess" suggest that
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_2_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>the symbol has a richer significance than any one explication 
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_2_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>can express. This phenomenological fact suggests the
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_2_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>need for an abstract theory of symbol in which the symbol
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_2_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>is viewed as the primary fact and the meanings are viewed
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_2_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>as secondary. It also suggests that a thea-logy11 of the
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_2_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>Goddess would be very different from the theo-logy we
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_2_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>know in the West. But to spell out the primacy of symbol
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_2_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>in thea-logy in contrast to the primacy of explanation in
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_2_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>thea-logy would be to write another paper. Let me simply
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_2_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>state that I believe it is incumbent upon woman, who
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_2_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>have been deprived of a female religious symbol system
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_2_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>for so long and who are therefore in an excellent position
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_2_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>to recognize the power and primacy of symbols, to develop
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_2_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>a theory of symbol and thea-logy congruent with their
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_2_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>experience.
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_2_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>A second important implication of the Goddess symbol
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_2_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>for women is the affirmation of the female body. Because
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_2_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>of women's unique position as menstruants, birth-givers,
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_2_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>and because they have traditionally cared for the young
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_2_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>and the dying, women's connection to the body, nature
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_2_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>and finitude has been an obvious fact. In early religious
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_2_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>consciousness birth-giving powers were celebrated and
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_2_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>women were positively valued. But as Western religions
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_2_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>entered into a state of alienation from the body, nature
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_2_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>and this world, women were denigrated because they
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_2_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>seemed more carnal, fleshy and earthy than the culture
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_2_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>creating males.12 The misogynist anti-body tradition in
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_2_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>Western thought is symbolized in the myth of Eve who is
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_2_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>traditionally viewed as a sexual temptress, the epitome of
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_2_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>women's carnal nature. This tradition reaches its nadir in
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_2_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>the Malleus Maleficarum (The Hammer of Evil-Doing
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_2_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>Women) which states, "All witchcraft stems from carnal

				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_2_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>The denigration of the female body is also expressed in
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_2_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>the taboos of our culture that surround menstruation and
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_2_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>childbirth. While menstruation taboos may have originated
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_2_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>in a perception of the awesome powers of the female
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_2_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>body,"4 they have degenerated into a simple perception
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_2_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>that something is "wrong" with female bodily functions
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_2_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>Menstruation is viewed as a curse, and women grow up
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_2_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>believing that the bloody facts of menstruation are best
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_2_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>hidden. Judy Chicago's Menstruation Bathroom broke
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_2_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>these taboos. In a sterile white bathroom she exhibited
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_2_1_tl_45' n='N045'/>boxes of tampons and Kotex on an open shelf, while the
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_2_1_tl_46' n='N046'/>wastepaper basket overflowed with bloody tampons and
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_2_1_tl_47' n='N047'/>Kotex.15 Many women who saw the piece felt relieved to
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_2_1_tl_48' n='N048'/>have their "dirty secret" out in the open.
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_2_1_tl_49' n='N049'/>The denigration of the female body and its powers is
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_2_1_tl_50' n='N050'/>further expressed in Western culture's attitudes toward
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_2_1_tl_51' n='N051'/>childbirth. Giving birth is treated as a disease requiring
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_2_1_tl_52' n='N052'/>hospitalization and the woman is viewed as a passive 
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_2_1_tl_53' n='N053'/>object, anesthetized to ensure her acquiescence to the will
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_2_1_tl_54' n='N054'/>of the doctor.16. The women's liberation movement has
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_2_1_tl_55' n='N055'/>aided the advocates of natural childbirth and home birth
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_2_1_tl_56' n='N056'/>by emphasizing the need for women to control and take
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_2_1_tl_57' n='N057'/>pride in their bodies.
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_2_1_tl_58' n='N058'/>The symbol of Goddess aids this process of naming and
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_2_1_tl_59' n='N059'/>reclaiming the female body and its functions. In the 
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_2_1_tl_60' n='N060'/>ancient world and among modern women, the Goddess 
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_2_1_tl_61' n='N061'/>symbol represents the birth, death and rebirth processes of the
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_2_1_tl_62' n='N062'/>natural and human worlds. The female body is viewed as
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_2_1_tl_63' n='N063'/>a direct expression or incarnation of waxing and waning,
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_2_1_tl_64' n='N064'/>life and death cycles in the universe because of the 
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_2_1_tl_65' n='N065'/>connection between the 28-day cycles of menstruation and

			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_1_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>the 28-day cycles of the moon. How amazing it is for
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_1_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>modern women to learn that many of the ancient Goddess
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_1_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>figures were painted with red ochre between the legs, the
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_1_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>menstrual blood out in the open, a symbol of female
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_1_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>power."7. The Goddess is often depicted in the act of 
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_1_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>giving birth, and the birth process is viewed as a symbol of
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_1_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>the life-giving powers of the universe.18 The possibilities
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_1_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>of reclaiming the powers of the female body in Goddess
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_1_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>rituals are expressed in the summer solstice ritual created
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_1_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>by Barbry MyOwn and Hallie Mountainwing. In this ritual
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_1_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>the women simulated a birth canal through which they
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_1_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>birthed each other into their circle. They raised power by
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_1_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>placing their hands on each other's bellies and chanting
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_1_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>together. Finally, they marked each other's faces with rich
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_1_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>dark menstrual blood saying, "This is the blood that promises
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_1_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>renewal. This is the blood that promises sustenance.
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_1_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>This is the blood that promises life."19 From hidden dirty
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_1_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>secret to symbol of the life power of the Goddess, 
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_1_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>women's blood has come full circle. The degree to which this
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_1_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>ritual seems indelicate or shocking indicates how far
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_1_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>modern culture is from perceiving the sacrality of the
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_1_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>female body.
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_1_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>The mood created by the symbol of Goddess as life
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_1_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>and birth power is one of positive, joyful affirmation of
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_1_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>the female body and its powers and processes. The 
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_1_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>motivations are to overcome the stereotypes of menstruant
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_1_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>women as hysterical, to recognize the blood bonds shared
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_1_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>by women, to value birth as an expression of the ultimate
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_1_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>life power, to return the birth process to the hands of
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_1_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>women and to overcome the spirit/flesh dualism of Western 
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_1_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>culture.
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_1_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>While the symbolic reclamation of the body and 
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_1_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>nature is especially important to women who have been 
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_1_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>associated with the despised body, it also has profound 
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_4_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>significance for men and all beings. The denigration of the
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_4_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>body and the spirit/flesh, mind/body split has been 
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_4_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>injurious to men too. The denigration of the body and
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_4_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>nature has also contributed to our current ecological crisis
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_4_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>because nature has been viewed simply as material for
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_4_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>human consumption. Thus, the Goddess as symbol of the
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_4_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>revaluation of body and nature can pull together many of
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_4_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>the themes addressed separately in the human potential
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_4_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>and ecology movements. In this case the mood is one of
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_4_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>affirmation, awe and respect for the body and nature and
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_4_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>the motivation is to respect the teaching of the body and
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_4_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>the rights of all living beings.
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_4_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>A third important implication of the symbol of Goddess 
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_4_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>for women is the positive valuation of will in a 
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_4_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>Goddess-centered framework. Here I am not referring to the
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_4_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>symbol of Goddess in general, but specifically to the 
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_4_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>notion of will in Goddess-centered ritual magic and spell
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_4_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>casting. The basic notion behind ritual magic and spell
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_4_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>casting is energy as power. The Goddess is a center or
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_4_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>focus of power and energy; She is the personification of
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_4_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>the energy which flows between beings in the natural and
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_4_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>human worlds. According to Starhawk, "witches conceive
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_4_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>of psychic energy as having form and substance that can
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_4_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>be perceived and directed by those with a trained awareness.
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_4_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>The power generated within the circle is built into a
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_4_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>cone form, and at its peak is released—to the Goddess, to
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_4_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>reenergize the members of the coven, or to do a specific
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_4_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>work such as healing."20 In ritual magic, energy is directed
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_4_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>by will power.
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_4_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>The emphasis on the will is important for women 
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_4_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>because women traditionally have been taught to devalue
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_4_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>their wills, to believe that they cannot achieve their will
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_4_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>through their own power and even to suspect that the 
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_4_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>assertion of will is evil. Faith Wilding's poem "Waiting
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_4_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>sums up women's sense that their lives are defined not by
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_4_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>their own will, but by waiting for others to take the 
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_4_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>initiative.

				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_4_1_tl_48' n='N048'/>Patriarchal religion has enforced the view that female
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_4_1_tl_49' n='N049'/>initiative and will are evil through the juxtaposition of Eve
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_4_1_tl_50' n='N050'/>and Mary. Eve caused the fall by asserting her will over
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_4_1_tl_51' n='N051'/>and against the command of God, while Mary began the
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_4_1_tl_52' n='N052'/>new age with her response to God's initiative, "Let it be
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_4_1_tl_53' n='N053'/>done to me according to thy word" (Luke 1:38). Even for
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_4_1_tl_54' n='N054'/>men, patriarchal religions value the passive will. The
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_4_1_tl_55' n='N055'/>classical doctrines of sin and grace view sin as the prideful
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_4_1_tl_56' n='N056'/>assertion of will and grace as the obedient subordination
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_4_1_tl_57' n='N057'/>of human will (female or male) to the divine initiative or
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_4_1_tl_58' n='N058'/>order. Although this view of will might be questioned
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_4_1_tl_59' n='N059'/>from a human perspective, Valerie Saiving Goldstein has
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_4_1_tl_60' n='N060'/>argued that it has particularly deleterious consequences
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_4_1_tl_61' n='N061'/>for women in Western culture. According to Goldstein,
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_4_1_tl_62' n='N062'/>secular Western culture encourages males in the assertion
			</p>
			<pb n='14'/>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_1_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>of will; thus in practice we may find that the male form of
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_1_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>sin is an excess of will. But since culture discourages fe
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_1_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>males in the assertion of will, the traditional doctrines of
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_1_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>sin and grace encourage women to remain in their form of
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_1_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>sin, which is self-negation or insufficient assertion of
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_1_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>will.22 One possible reason for the denigration of will in a
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_1_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>patriarchal religious framework is that both human and
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_1_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>divine will are often pictured as arbitrary, self-initiated
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_1_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>and exercised without regard for other wills.
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_1_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>In a Goddess-centered context, in contrast, the will is
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_1_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>valued. A woman is encouraged to know her will, to 
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_1_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>believe that her will is valid and to believe that her will can
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_1_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>be achieved in the world—three sources of strength and
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_1_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>motivation to take direct action, sources traditionally
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_1_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>denied to her in patriarchy. In a Goddess-centered frame
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_1_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>work a woman's will is not subordinated to the Lord God
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_1_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>as King and Ruler, nor to men as His representatives. Thus
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_1_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>a woman is not reduced to waiting for and acquiescing to
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_1_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>the will of others as she is in patriarchy. But neither does
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_1_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>she adopt the egocentric form of will that pursues self
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_1_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>interest without regard for the interests of others
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_1_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>The Goddess-centered context provides a different 
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_1_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>understanding of will than that available in the traditional
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_1_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>patriarchal religious framework. In the Goddess framework,
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_1_1_tl_25' n='N025'/> will can be achieved only when it is exercised in
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_1_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>harmony with the energies and wills of other beings. Wise
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_1_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>women, for example, raise a cone of healing energy at the
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_1_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>full moon or solstice when the lunar or solar energies are
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_1_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>at their high points with respect to the earth. This 
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_1_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>discipline encourages them to recognize that not all times
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_1_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>are propitious for the achieving of every will. Similarly
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_1_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>they know that spring is a time for new beginnings in work
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_1_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>and love; summer, a time for producing external 
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_1_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>manifestations of inner potentialities; and fall or winter, times
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_1_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>for stripping down to the inner core and for extending
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_1_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>roots. Such awareness of waxing and waning processes in
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_1_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>the universe discourages the arbitrary ego-centered 
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_1_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>assertion of will, while at the same time encouraging the 
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_1_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>assertion of individual will in cooperation with natural
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_1_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>energies and the energies created by the wills of others.
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_1_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>Wise women also have a traditional belief that whatever is
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_1_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>sent out will be returned, and this reminds them to assert
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_1_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>their wills in cooperative and healing ways rather than in
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_1_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>egocentric and destructive ones. This view of will allows
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_1_1_tl_45' n='N045'/>women to begin to recognize, claim and assert their will:
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_1_1_tl_46' n='N046'/>without adopting the undesirable characteristics of the
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_1_1_tl_47' n='N047'/>patriarchal understanding and use of will. This is not,
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_1_1_tl_48' n='N048'/>however, to imply that women invariably exercise their
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_1_1_tl_49' n='N049'/>wills for good. Women have as much of a capacity for
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_1_1_tl_50' n='N050'/>positive and negative thoughts and actions as men do. All
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_1_1_tl_51' n='N051'/>I am saying is that in the Goddess-centered context, the
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_1_1_tl_52' n='N052'/>will of women is not devalued per se as it is in the Biblical
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_1_1_tl_53' n='N053'/>and theological traditions discussed above.
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_1_1_tl_54' n='N054'/>In the Goddess-centered framework the mood is one of
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_1_1_tl_55' n='N055'/>positive affirmation of personal will in the context of the
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_1_1_tl_56' n='N056'/>energies of other wills or beings. The motivation is for

				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_1_1_tl_62' n='N062'/>to Virginia Woolf, a sentence such as "Chloe liked
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_1_1_tl_63' n='N063'/>Olivia," which describes a woman's relationship to an
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_1_1_tl_64' n='N064'/>other woman, rarely occurs in stories written by men 
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_2_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>because men write of women only in their relationship to a
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_2_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>man (or men).23 Adrienne Rich points out that the mother
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_2_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>daughter relationship, perhaps the most important 
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_2_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>relationship of woman to woman, a relationship "resonant
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_2_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>with charges. ..the flow of energy between two biologically 
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_2_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>alike bodies, one of which has lain in amniotic bliss

				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_2_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>the other"24 is rarely celebrated in patriarchal religion and
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_2_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>culture. Christianity celebrates the father's relation to the
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_2_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>son and the mother's relation to the son but the story of
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_2_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>the mother and daughter is missing.
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_2_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>In patriarchal literature and psychology, the relationship 
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_2_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>between mothers and daughters is seldom considered
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_2_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>or even mentioned. As de Beauvoir has noted, the mother
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_2_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>daughter relationship is distorted in our male-defined
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_2_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>culture because the mother (perhaps subconsciously) 
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_2_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>believes her role is to prepare her daughter to enter into that
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_2_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>male-controlled culture in which women are viewed as
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_2_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>inferior.25 The mother socializes her daughter to become
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_2_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>subordinate to men, and if the daughter challenges 
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_2_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>patriarchal norms, the mother is likely to defend the 
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_2_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>patriarchal structures against her own daughter.
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_2_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>The bond of woman to woman is beginning to be 
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_2_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>celebrated in the new women's culture. Holly Near has written
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_2_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>several songs that celebrate the woman bond and women's 
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_2_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>heritage. In one of her finest songs she writes of an
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_2_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>"old time woman" who is "waiting to die." A young woman 
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_2_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>feels for the life that has passed the old woman by and
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_2_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>begins to cry, but the old woman looks her in the eye and
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_2_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>says, "If I had not suffered, you wouldn't be wearing those
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_2_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>jeans/ Being an old time woman ain't as bad as it seems."2e
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_2_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>This song expresses and celebrates a bond and a heritage
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_2_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>passed down from one woman to another. In another of
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_2_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>Near's songs, she sings of "a hiking boot mother who's
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_2_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>seeing the world/ For the first time with her own little
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_2_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>girl." In this song, the mother tells the drifter who has
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_2_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>been traveling with her to pack up and travel alone if he
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_2_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>thinks "traveling three is a drag" because "I've got a little
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_2_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>one who loves me as much as you need me/ And darling
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_2_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>that's loving enough."2 This song is significant because
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_2_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>the mother places her relationship to her daughter above
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_2_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>her relationship to a man, something that is rare for women 
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_2_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>to do in patriarchy.2
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_2_1_tl_45' n='N045'/>One of the few accounts of a relationship between
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_2_1_tl_46' n='N046'/>mother and daughter that has survived from ancient times
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_2_1_tl_47' n='N047'/>is the myth of the Goddess Demeter and her daughter
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_2_1_tl_48' n='N048'/>Persephone. This story was told, possibly enacted, in 
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_2_1_tl_49' n='N049'/>connection with the religious rites of the Thesmophoria
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_2_1_tl_50' n='N050'/>which were for women only, and the Eleusinian Mysteries
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_2_1_tl_51' n='N051'/>of Greece. In this story Persephone is abducted by the
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_2_1_tl_52' n='N052'/>God of the Underworld and forced to live in the Under
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_2_1_tl_53' n='N053'/>world as his wife. Unwilling to accept this state of affairs,
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_2_1_tl_54' n='N054'/>Mother Demeter, in her rage, withholds the rain and thus
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_2_1_tl_55' n='N055'/>prevents the growth of all food until her daughter is 
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_2_1_tl_56' n='N056'/>returned to her. What is important for women in this 
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_2_1_tl_57' n='N057'/>ancient religious story is that the mother fights for her
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_2_1_tl_58' n='N058'/>daughter and for her relationship to her daughter. This is a
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_2_1_tl_59' n='N059'/>completely different view of the mother's relationship to
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_2_1_tl_60' n='N060'/>her daughter from that which exists in a patriarchal 
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_2_1_tl_61' n='N061'/>culture. The mood created by the story of Demeter and 
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_2_1_tl_62' n='N062'/>Persephone is one of sacred celebration of the mother
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_2_1_tl_63' n='N063'/>daughter bond and the motivation is for mothers and
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_2_1_tl_64' n='N064'/>daughters to affirm the heritage passed on from mother to
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_2_1_tl_65' n='N065'/>daughter and to reject the patriarchal pattern in which

				<lb facs='#facs_15_r_1_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>of female power, denigration of the female body,

				<lb facs='#facs_15_r_1_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>by patriarchal religions. As women struggle to create a

				<lb facs='#facs_15_r_1_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>bonds are celebrated, the symbol of the Goddess naturally
				<lb facs='#facs_15_r_1_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>reemerges and speaks to the deep mind, expressing our

				<lb facs='#facs_18_r_3_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>the frustration of repeatedly running up against the stone
				<lb facs='#facs_18_r_3_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>wall of religious dogma. This dogma functions to preserve
				<lb facs='#facs_18_r_3_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>patriarchal institutions and to prevent the establishment
				<lb facs='#facs_18_r_3_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>of equal rights and opportunities for women in the United
				<lb facs='#facs_18_r_3_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>States and other countries throughout the world. Far from

				<lb facs='#facs_18_r_3_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>subjugation of women. Ironically, religious faiths, which
				<lb facs='#facs_18_r_3_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>supposedly provide the moral and ethical basis of culture,
				<lb facs='#facs_18_r_3_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>are stubbornly and irrationally opposed to the development

				<lb facs='#facs_18_r_3_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>change during adolescence, when overnight I emerged

				<lb facs='#facs_18_r_3_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>a questioning, agnostic search for a satisfactory philosophy 
				<lb facs='#facs_18_r_3_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>to sustain me through life. During my childhood and
				<lb facs='#facs_18_r_3_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>adolescence, I deeply experienced the damage done by
				<lb facs='#facs_18_r_3_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>the prevalent attitudes towards females. Perhaps for this
				<lb facs='#facs_18_r_3_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>reason, 1finally found a possible answer in feminism.
				<lb facs='#facs_18_r_3_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>Of all my experiences, the most fulfilling sense of unity
				<lb facs='#facs_18_r_3_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>and of purpose and belief, within myself and within 
				<lb facs='#facs_18_r_3_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>relationships, has come from reading feminist literature
				<lb facs='#facs_18_r_3_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>meeting, working, demonstrating, agonizing, organizing
				<lb facs='#facs_18_r_3_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>and occasionally celebrating with my sisters. Nevertheless, 
				<lb facs='#facs_18_r_3_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>I still felt a lack, a sense of something missing. When
				<lb facs='#facs_18_r_3_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>my reading progressed to a number of books, which have
				<lb facs='#facs_18_r_3_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>appeared in recent years, describing the matriarchal
				<lb facs='#facs_18_r_3_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>cultures and religions that existed in prehistoric times,
				<lb facs='#facs_18_r_3_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>began to understand why.
				<lb facs='#facs_18_r_3_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>I tried to imagine what it must have been like to live in
				<lb facs='#facs_18_r_3_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>a society where people worshipped a female deity and
				<lb facs='#facs_18_r_3_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>where women held positions of power and responsibility.
				<lb facs='#facs_18_r_3_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>What would it feel like to pray to God the Mother? To sing
				<lb facs='#facs_18_r_3_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>paeans of praise to Her glory? As I experimented, in spite
				<lb facs='#facs_18_r_3_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>of my essential agnosticism, I found myself feeling a great
				<lb facs='#facs_18_r_3_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>sense of peace in the mere act of praying to a loving,
				<lb facs='#facs_18_r_3_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>female God. The experience was light-years away from
				<lb facs='#facs_18_r_3_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>the nightmares I had suffered as a child of being 
				<lb facs='#facs_18_r_3_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>consigned to hell by a punitive male god. I also felt deep
				<lb facs='#facs_18_r_3_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>anguish to know that such religions had existed thousands
				<lb facs='#facs_18_r_3_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>of years ago, only to have been ruthlessly destroyed by
				<lb facs='#facs_18_r_3_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>barbaric patriarchal invaders.
				<lb facs='#facs_18_r_3_1_tl_45' n='N045'/>When I discussed these ideas with feminists from other
				<lb facs='#facs_18_r_3_1_tl_46' n='N046'/>parts of the world, at the International Women's Year
				<lb facs='#facs_18_r_3_1_tl_47' n='N047'/>Tribune in Mexico City, at the International Tribunal on
				<lb facs='#facs_18_r_3_1_tl_48' n='N048'/>Crimes Against Women in Brussels and with women I met
				<lb facs='#facs_18_r_3_1_tl_49' n='N049'/>during other travels, they were as enthusiastic as my
				<lb facs='#facs_18_r_3_1_tl_50' n='N050'/>sisters closer to home.

				<lb facs='#facs_18_r_4_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>The IWY Florida Conference in Orlando last July 
				<lb facs='#facs_18_r_4_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>provided the stimulus to goad me into action. Mormons,
				<lb facs='#facs_18_r_4_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>Baptists and various fundamentalist religious groups were
				<lb facs='#facs_18_r_4_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>there in force, joined with the American Nazi Party, John
				<lb facs='#facs_18_r_4_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>Birch Society and Ku Klux Klan to try to subvert the
				<lb facs='#facs_18_r_4_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>conference. When they began singing hymns, I sang along
				<lb facs='#facs_18_r_4_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>but with one major difference: I changed the hymns to
				<lb facs='#facs_18_r_4_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>Hers. When they sang, "He's got the whole world in his
				<lb facs='#facs_18_r_4_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>hands," I happily warbled, "She's got the whole world..
				<lb facs='#facs_18_r_4_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>When the conference closed with a recitation of the
				<lb facs='#facs_18_r_4_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>Lord's Prayer, I joyfully intoned, "Our Mother who art in
				<lb facs='#facs_18_r_4_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>heaven..." And when I returned home after the 
				<lb facs='#facs_18_r_4_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>conference was over, I sent my granddaughter a new version
				<lb facs='#facs_18_r_4_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>of Jesus Loves Me, which is:
				<lb facs='#facs_18_r_4_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>Isis loves me, this I know
				<lb facs='#facs_18_r_4_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>Mother God has told me so.
				<lb facs='#facs_18_r_4_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>She is strong and so are we
				<lb facs='#facs_18_r_4_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>Fighting for equality.
				<lb facs='#facs_18_r_4_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>Yes, Isis loves me
				<lb facs='#facs_18_r_4_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>Yes, Isis loves me
				<lb facs='#facs_18_r_4_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>Yes, Isis loves me
				<lb facs='#facs_18_r_4_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>Our Lady told me so.
				<lb facs='#facs_18_r_4_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>After the Orlando conference, Becky Berg, Florida
				<lb facs='#facs_18_r_4_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>State Coordinator of the National Organization for Women, 
				<lb facs='#facs_18_r_4_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>asked me to help her conduct a workshop on women
				<lb facs='#facs_18_r_4_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>and religion at the Florida NOW State Conference last
				<lb facs='#facs_18_r_4_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>September. In preparation for this conference I began to
				<lb facs='#facs_18_r_4_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>think through some of the ideas that had been taking form
				<lb facs='#facs_18_r_4_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>in my mind.
				<lb facs='#facs_18_r_4_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>The sum total of my experiences led me to realize that
				<lb facs='#facs_18_r_4_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>lack of faith in an organized religion had left a hole in my
				<lb facs='#facs_18_r_4_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>life which no amount of rational, philosophical speculations 
				<lb facs='#facs_18_r_4_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>about the meaning of it all can fill. The fact is
				<lb facs='#facs_18_r_4_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>enjoy the rituals, symbols, songs, processions, ceremonies
				<lb facs='#facs_18_r_4_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>—the full panoply of organized religion. I like to wear
				<lb facs='#facs_18_r_4_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>clothing and jewelry that express my commitment to and
				<lb facs='#facs_18_r_4_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>faith in my beliefs. I enjoy singing along with people,
				<lb facs='#facs_18_r_4_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>joining hands, performing rites and acts that physically
				<lb facs='#facs_18_r_4_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>demonstrate and symbolize my emotional, spiritual and
				<lb facs='#facs_18_r_4_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>philosophical self—my deepest being. But I also realize
				<lb facs='#facs_18_r_4_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>that I am quite incapable of participating in such rituals
				<lb facs='#facs_18_r_4_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>while being totally opposed to the doctrines they
				<lb facs='#facs_18_r_4_1_tl_43' n='N043'/> represent. There is no way I can take part in a religion that
				<lb facs='#facs_18_r_4_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>preaches the subjugation of women.
				<lb facs='#facs_18_r_4_1_tl_45' n='N045'/>The answer to this dilemma then became so obvious
				<lb facs='#facs_18_r_4_1_tl_46' n='N046'/>that I am shocked not to have found it sooner. I believe
				<lb facs='#facs_18_r_4_1_tl_47' n='N047'/>the answer is to reinstate a feminist religion that can fulfill
				<lb facs='#facs_18_r_4_1_tl_48' n='N048'/>the human need for religious rituals at the same time that
				<lb facs='#facs_18_r_4_1_tl_49' n='N049'/>it celebrates our feminist faith in the ultimate good of
			</p>
			<pb n='19'/>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_19_r_1_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>being female and invokes the Mother-God-given right of
				<lb facs='#facs_19_r_1_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>every woman to enjoy full freedom and equal opportunity
				<lb facs='#facs_19_r_1_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>in all aspects of life.
				<lb facs='#facs_19_r_1_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>Such a religion would provide opportunities for women
				<lb facs='#facs_19_r_1_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>to meet together to take part in ceremonies and to 
				<lb facs='#facs_19_r_1_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>reaffirm our faith in our feminist beliefs. This spiritual and
				<lb facs='#facs_19_r_1_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>emotional renewal would strengthen the bonds among us.
				<lb facs='#facs_19_r_1_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>Besides providing spiritual sustenance, the feminist
				<lb facs='#facs_19_r_1_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>religion could be a powerful tool in our fight for equal
				<lb facs='#facs_19_r_1_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>rights. In spite of the supposed Constitutional separation
				<lb facs='#facs_19_r_1_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>of church and state, the fact is that our legal codes are
				<lb facs='#facs_19_r_1_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>based on patriarchal religious dogmas and customs. The
				<lb facs='#facs_19_r_1_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>frequency with which opponents of the Equal Rights
				<lb facs='#facs_19_r_1_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>Amendment and other feminist issues quote the Bible to
				<lb facs='#facs_19_r_1_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>justify their opposition is evidence enough of the use of
				<lb facs='#facs_19_r_1_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>religion for political purposes. The doctrine of an 
				<lb facs='#facs_19_r_1_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>organized religion that propounds feminist values as the
				<lb facs='#facs_19_r_1_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>direct reflection of Divine Intention is the ultimate answer
				<lb facs='#facs_19_r_1_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>to those who argue that a male god has decreed other
				<lb facs='#facs_19_r_1_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>wise. Fighting fire with fire, our rites could help us win our
				<lb facs='#facs_19_r_1_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>rights.
				<lb facs='#facs_19_r_1_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>The NOW conference workshop offered the opportunity 
				<lb facs='#facs_19_r_1_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>to explain these feelings and experiences to other
				<lb facs='#facs_19_r_1_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>women and to propose that we establish our own feminist
				<lb facs='#facs_19_r_1_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>religion. I also offered a few specific suggestions that
				<lb facs='#facs_19_r_1_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>seemed positive. First, that the religion be as undogmatic
				<lb facs='#facs_19_r_1_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>and non-authoritarian as possible to best serve as a 
				<lb facs='#facs_19_r_1_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>vehicle for expressing the thoughts, feelings, needs and
				<lb facs='#facs_19_r_1_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>desires of all of us. Second, that care must be exercised to
				<lb facs='#facs_19_r_1_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>avoid forming the usual hierarchy of clergy as separate
				<lb facs='#facs_19_r_1_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>from congregation and to assure maximum participation
				<lb facs='#facs_19_r_1_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>of everyone concerned in formulating and carrying out
				<lb facs='#facs_19_r_1_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>the doctrines and rituals of a feminist religion.
				<lb facs='#facs_19_r_1_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>I do, however, believe that a formal women's religious
				<lb facs='#facs_19_r_1_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>organization would be economically advantageous in that
				<lb facs='#facs_19_r_1_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>it would enable us to have access to the tax benefits
				<lb facs='#facs_19_r_1_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>allowed to other religious groups. These benefits could
				<lb facs='#facs_19_r_1_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>help to cover the cost of clinics, publications, learning
				<lb facs='#facs_19_r_1_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>centers and many other aspects of the women's movement.
				<lb facs='#facs_19_r_1_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>In addition to these considerations, there is one 
				<lb facs='#facs_19_r_1_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>fundamental principle that I feel must be basic to our religion
				<lb facs='#facs_19_r_1_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>if it is to express feminist beliefs. This is the divine right of
				<lb facs='#facs_19_r_1_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>every child to be born to a mother who wants it, which in
				<lb facs='#facs_19_r_1_1_tl_45' n='N045'/>turn would assure every woman the right to control her
				<lb facs='#facs_19_r_1_1_tl_46' n='N046'/>own body and to bear children only when and if she
				<lb facs='#facs_19_r_1_1_tl_47' n='N047'/>wholeheartedly wants to do so. I feel that the act of
				<lb facs='#facs_19_r_1_1_tl_48' n='N048'/>exercising this control, whether by means of birth control,
				<lb facs='#facs_19_r_1_1_tl_49' n='N049'/>abortion or abstention, should be considered to be in
				<lb facs='#facs_19_r_1_1_tl_50' n='N050'/>total accord with our belief in "divine intention.
				<lb facs='#facs_19_r_1_1_tl_51' n='N051'/>would also like to see the physical fact of being
				<lb facs='#facs_19_r_1_1_tl_52' n='N052'/>female sanctified and celebrated. Since the aura of guilt
				<lb facs='#facs_19_r_1_1_tl_53' n='N053'/>and disgust surrounding female physiology promulgated
				<lb facs='#facs_19_r_1_1_tl_54' n='N054'/>by a misogynistic patriarchy is so destructive and 
				<lb facs='#facs_19_r_1_1_tl_55' n='N055'/>damaging to women's emotional and physical well-being,
				<lb facs='#facs_19_r_1_1_tl_56' n='N056'/>would like to see this attitude replaced by feelings of joy
				<lb facs='#facs_19_r_1_1_tl_57' n='N057'/>and self-affirmation in the inherent good of being female.
				<lb facs='#facs_19_r_1_1_tl_58' n='N058'/>Generally, I would like our feminist religion to be
				<lb facs='#facs_19_r_1_1_tl_59' n='N059'/>positive, joyous and free of fear. Rather than teaching the
				<lb facs='#facs_19_r_1_1_tl_60' n='N060'/>dogma of original sin, we could proclaim the fact of
				<lb facs='#facs_19_r_1_1_tl_61' n='N061'/>original good. I would prefer a list of "Thou shalts" rather
				<lb facs='#facs_19_r_1_1_tl_62' n='N062'/>than "Thou shalt nots" and a philosophy of rewards for
				<lb facs='#facs_19_r_1_1_tl_63' n='N063'/>doing good rather than punishments for doing wrong.
				<lb facs='#facs_19_r_1_1_tl_64' n='N064'/>would like our religion to affirm the intrinsic good of all
				<lb facs='#facs_19_r_1_1_tl_65' n='N065'/>expressions of love between humans, regardless of sex or
				<lb facs='#facs_19_r_1_1_tl_66' n='N066'/>of other artificial restrictions imposed by a patriarchal
				<lb facs='#facs_19_r_1_1_tl_67' n='N067'/>autocracy.

			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_19_r_2_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>Along with the suggestions that have been mentioned,
				<lb facs='#facs_19_r_2_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>we would welcome a wide diversity of other ideas, 
				<lb facs='#facs_19_r_2_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>according to people's needs and desires. These might come
				<lb facs='#facs_19_r_2_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>from Wicca, Zen or any other source that we feel has
				<lb facs='#facs_19_r_2_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>something valuable to offer us.
				<lb facs='#facs_19_r_2_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>In summary, I would like to mention that the enthusiastic 
				<lb facs='#facs_19_r_2_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>response of those who took part in the NOW workshop
				<lb facs='#facs_19_r_2_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>convinced me that many women feel the need for a
				<lb facs='#facs_19_r_2_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>religion of our own and I suggest that the time is ripe for
				<lb facs='#facs_19_r_2_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>establishing it now.

				<lb facs='#facs_22_r_3_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>provides an emotional, descriptive,

				<lb facs='#facs_22_r_4_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>serves as useful background material
				<lb facs='#facs_22_r_4_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>for answering why women have created 
				<lb facs='#facs_22_r_4_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>rituals as an expression of the
				<lb facs='#facs_22_r_4_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>need for revitalization and as an impetus 
				<lb facs='#facs_22_r_4_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>for political action. First, Rosaldo
				<lb facs='#facs_22_r_4_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>establishes a model for interpreting the
				<lb facs='#facs_22_r_4_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>difference in status between men and
				<lb facs='#facs_22_r_4_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>women, a model based on extensive
				<lb facs='#facs_22_r_4_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>contemporary cross-cultural analysis
				<lb facs='#facs_22_r_4_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>of male/female roles and behavior
				<lb facs='#facs_22_r_4_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>She states that "an asymmetry in the

			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_22_r_6_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>women and men, appears to be universal." 
				<lb facs='#facs_22_r_6_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>This asymmetry is manifested
				<lb facs='#facs_22_r_6_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>the fact that male, as opposed to female,
				<lb facs='#facs_22_r_6_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>activities are always recognized as pre
				<lb facs='#facs_22_r_6_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>dominantly important, and cultural systems 
				<lb facs='#facs_22_r_6_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>give authority and value to the roles
				<lb facs='#facs_22_r_6_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>and activities of men. ...Everywhere
				<lb facs='#facs_22_r_6_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>from those societies we might want to
				<lb facs='#facs_22_r_6_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>call most egalitarian to those in which
				<lb facs='#facs_22_r_6_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>sexual stratification is most marked,
				<lb facs='#facs_22_r_6_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>men are the locus of cultural value.
				<lb facs='#facs_22_r_6_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>Over the past few thousand years
				<lb facs='#facs_22_r_6_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>women have not been culturally granted 
				<lb facs='#facs_22_r_6_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>a legitimate, overt way of demonstrating 
				<lb facs='#facs_22_r_6_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>their power, their personhood.
				<lb facs='#facs_22_r_6_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>Only men define, possess and confer
				<lb facs='#facs_22_r_6_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>power or authority, and power is the

			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_22_r_7_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>necessary ingredient for the creation of
				<lb facs='#facs_22_r_7_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>culture. Women are therefore consigned
				<lb facs='#facs_22_r_7_1_tl_3' n='N003'/> to live on the fringes of culture,
				<lb facs='#facs_22_r_7_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>locked in domestic zones which are
				<lb facs='#facs_22_r_7_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>rarely defined as part of the cultural
				<lb facs='#facs_22_r_7_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>territory. Rosaldo elaborates this point
				<lb facs='#facs_22_r_7_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>by using Mary Douglas's notion of "the
				<lb facs='#facs_22_r_7_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>anomalous."
				<lb facs='#facs_22_r_7_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>Recent studies of symbolic culture have
				<lb facs='#facs_22_r_7_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>suggested that whatever violates a society's
				<lb facs='#facs_22_r_7_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>sense of order will be seen as threatening, 
				<lb facs='#facs_22_r_7_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>nasty, disorderly, or wrong. Douglas
				<lb facs='#facs_22_r_7_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>has called this sort of thing "anomalous."
				<lb facs='#facs_22_r_7_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>The idea of "order" depends, logically
				<lb facs='#facs_22_r_7_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>on "disorder" as its opposite, yet society
				<lb facs='#facs_22_r_7_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>tries to set such things aside. Insofar
				<lb facs='#facs_22_r_7_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>as men. . define the public order women 
				<lb facs='#facs_22_r_7_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>are their opposite. Where men are
				<lb facs='#facs_22_r_7_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>classified in terms of ranked, institutional 
				<lb facs='#facs_22_r_7_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>positions, women are simply women
				<lb facs='#facs_22_r_7_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>and their activities, interests and 
				<lb facs='#facs_22_r_7_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>differences receive only idiosyncratic note.
				<lb facs='#facs_22_r_7_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>Women are anomalies in most cultures
				<lb facs='#facs_22_r_7_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>and have no cultural recourse for 
				<lb facs='#facs_22_r_7_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>demonstrating the reality of female power
				<lb facs='#facs_22_r_7_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>Female power is almost without exception 
				<lb facs='#facs_22_r_7_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>displayed covertly under the rubric
				<lb facs='#facs_22_r_7_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>of influence or association with the
				<lb facs='#facs_22_r_7_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>right man. But Rosaldo makes a unique
				<lb facs='#facs_22_r_7_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>claim for the possible use women may
				<lb facs='#facs_22_r_7_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>make of their anomalous or liminal positions. 
				<lb facs='#facs_22_r_7_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>Even though women's status is
				<lb facs='#facs_22_r_7_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>lowest in those societies where there is
				<lb facs='#facs_22_r_7_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>the greatest distinction between the
				<lb facs='#facs_22_r_7_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>public and domestic realms and where
				<lb facs='#facs_22_r_7_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>women are isolated from each other,
				<lb facs='#facs_22_r_7_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>"their position is raised when they can
				<lb facs='#facs_22_r_7_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>challenge those claims of male authority, 
				<lb facs='#facs_22_r_7_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>either by taking on men's roles or
				<lb facs='#facs_22_r_7_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>by establishing social ties, by creating a
				<lb facs='#facs_22_r_7_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>sense of rank, order, and value in a
				<lb facs='#facs_22_r_7_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>world in which women prevail."* It is
				<lb facs='#facs_22_r_7_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>also clear that historically women have
				<lb facs='#facs_22_r_7_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>taken on very active roles in social systems 
				<lb facs='#facs_22_r_7_1_tl_45' n='N045'/>by "manipulating, elaborating, or
				<lb facs='#facs_22_r_7_1_tl_46' n='N046'/>undermining" their domestic roles and
				<lb facs='#facs_22_r_7_1_tl_47' n='N047'/>by stressing their differences from men.
				<lb facs='#facs_22_r_7_1_tl_48' n='N048'/>In other words, by giving special attention 
				<lb facs='#facs_22_r_7_1_tl_49' n='N049'/>to their anomalous status, women
				<lb facs='#facs_22_r_7_1_tl_50' n='N050'/>have been able "to take on powers
				<lb facs='#facs_22_r_7_1_tl_51' n='N051'/>uniquely their own."5 Especially

				<lb facs='#facs_23_r_1_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>Of course it is most significant that
				<lb facs='#facs_23_r_1_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>these roles include the classic examples

				<lb facs='#facs_23_r_1_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>utilize ritual means as a source of gaining

				<lb facs='#facs_23_r_3_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>tenaciously held the rights to ritual

				<lb facs='#facs_23_r_3_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>ancient priestesses of the goddess. In
				<lb facs='#facs_23_r_3_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>fact the participation in ritual by men
				<lb facs='#facs_23_r_3_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>has been their most profound display
				<lb facs='#facs_23_r_3_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>of cultural authority and their most
				<lb facs='#facs_23_r_3_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>direct access to it. The performance

				<lb facs='#facs_23_r_3_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>and "civilized," is a simultaneous 
				<lb facs='#facs_23_r_3_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>acknowledgment of men's warrant to
				<lb facs='#facs_23_r_3_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>create and define culture and, by 
				<lb facs='#facs_23_r_3_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>exclusion, a sign to women to keep in
				<lb facs='#facs_23_r_3_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>their place, a place which we have al-
				<lb facs='#facs_23_r_3_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>ready designated as outside culture

				<lb facs='#facs_23_r_3_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>Here we see a further distinction 
				<lb facs='#facs_23_r_3_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>between the sacred and the profane
				<lb facs='#facs_23_r_3_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>based on the asymmetry of male-female 
				<lb facs='#facs_23_r_3_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>relationships. Men have claimed

				<lb facs='#facs_24_r_2_1_tl_55' n='N055'/>Although the ritual is ostensibly
				<lb facs='#facs_24_r_2_1_tl_56' n='N056'/>practiced to make their lovers remain
				<lb facs='#facs_24_r_2_1_tl_57' n='N057'/>faithful, the beauty of the ceremony
				<lb facs='#facs_24_r_2_1_tl_58' n='N058'/>lies in its kinship with all ritual acts,
				<lb facs='#facs_24_r_2_1_tl_59' n='N059'/>both past and present, which describe
				<lb facs='#facs_24_r_2_1_tl_60' n='N060'/>the healing, nurturing effect of tribal
				<lb facs='#facs_24_r_2_1_tl_61' n='N061'/>sisterhood. The overt goal of the ritual
				<lb facs='#facs_24_r_2_1_tl_62' n='N062'/>is not the only reason for performing it;
				<lb facs='#facs_24_r_2_1_tl_63' n='N063'/>something significant is taking place in
				<lb facs='#facs_24_r_2_1_tl_64' n='N064'/>the act of performance too. An

				<lb facs='#facs_24_r_2_1_tl_66' n='N066'/>sacralized by her sisters, her comadres,
				<lb facs='#facs_24_r_2_1_tl_67' n='N067'/>her C-R group, her kind.
				<lb facs='#facs_24_r_2_1_tl_68' n='N068'/>The above presentation of woman's

				<lb facs='#facs_24_r_3_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>In fact the range of expressive material 
				<lb facs='#facs_24_r_3_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>in current feminist ritual sets is so

				<lb facs='#facs_24_r_3_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>that one of the major tasks of the

				<lb facs='#facs_24_r_3_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>movement must be to document the growth
				<lb facs='#facs_24_r_3_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>of ritual events. Someone must also
				<lb facs='#facs_24_r_3_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>take on the project of assembling what
				<lb facs='#facs_24_r_3_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>cross-cultural historical evidence exists
				<lb facs='#facs_24_r_3_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>of women's rituals such as the KAIK
				<lb facs='#facs_24_r_3_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>MIKTE
				<lb facs='#facs_24_r_3_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>In "The Qualitative Leap Beyond
				<lb facs='#facs_24_r_3_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>Patriarchal Religion," theologian Mary
				<lb facs='#facs_24_r_3_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>Daly makes the following statement:
				<lb facs='#facs_24_r_3_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>The Women's revolution is not merely
				<lb facs='#facs_24_r_3_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>about equality within a patriarchal society 
				<lb facs='#facs_24_r_3_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>(a contradiction in terms). It is about
				<lb facs='#facs_24_r_3_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>power and redefining power. Within
				<lb facs='#facs_24_r_3_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>patriarchy, power is generally understood 
				<lb facs='#facs_24_r_3_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>as power over people, the environment, 
				<lb facs='#facs_24_r_3_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>things. In the rising consciousness
				<lb facs='#facs_24_r_3_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>of women, power is experienced as
				<lb facs='#facs_24_r_3_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>power of presence to ourselves and to
				<lb facs='#facs_24_r_3_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>each other, as we affirm our own being
				<lb facs='#facs_24_r_3_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>against and beyond the alienated identity 
				<lb facs='#facs_24_r_3_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>bestowed upon us within the patriarchy. 
				<lb facs='#facs_24_r_3_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>This is experienced as power of
				<lb facs='#facs_24_r_3_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>absence by those who would objectify
				<lb facs='#facs_24_r_3_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>women as 'the other, as magnifying

				<lb facs='#facs_24_r_3_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>Daly's insistence that redefinition of
				<lb facs='#facs_24_r_3_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>power is a central goal of the women's
				<lb facs='#facs_24_r_3_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>movement is crucial for understanding
				<lb facs='#facs_24_r_3_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>the use of ritual by feminists, a symbolic 
				<lb facs='#facs_24_r_3_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>model for discovering how to give
				<lb facs='#facs_24_r_3_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>and get."power of presence." One
				<lb facs='#facs_24_r_3_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>woman empowers another (or herself)
				<lb facs='#facs_24_r_3_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>through reaffirmation of the body as an
				<lb facs='#facs_24_r_3_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>instrument of communion (not alienation).
				<lb facs='#facs_24_r_3_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>None of the rituals mentioned above
				<lb facs='#facs_24_r_3_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>would be considered effective if a
				<lb facs='#facs_24_r_3_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>transfer of power had not resulted. Yet
				<lb facs='#facs_24_r_3_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>it is of critical importance to note that
				<lb facs='#facs_24_r_3_1_tl_45' n='N045'/>power is rarely considered an object of
				<lb facs='#facs_24_r_3_1_tl_46' n='N046'/>possession which the group or individual
				<lb facs='#facs_24_r_3_1_tl_47' n='N047'/>may get hold of during ritual activity.
				<lb facs='#facs_24_r_3_1_tl_48' n='N048'/>What is stressed through ritual is the
				<lb facs='#facs_24_r_3_1_tl_49' n='N049'/>dynamic quality of power, the continual
				<lb facs='#facs_24_r_3_1_tl_50' n='N050'/>exchange of gifts which heightens
				<lb facs='#facs_24_r_3_1_tl_51' n='N051'/>the affirmative identity of all who 
				<lb facs='#facs_24_r_3_1_tl_52' n='N052'/>participate. Power emanates from within
				<lb facs='#facs_24_r_3_1_tl_53' n='N053'/>as it is simultaneously received from
				<lb facs='#facs_24_r_3_1_tl_54' n='N054'/>without. For women in revolution it is
				<lb facs='#facs_24_r_3_1_tl_55' n='N055'/>imperative to create an entirely new
				<lb facs='#facs_24_r_3_1_tl_56' n='N056'/>value system, the heart of which will be
				<lb facs='#facs_24_r_3_1_tl_57' n='N057'/>a dramatic reassessment of the use of
				<lb facs='#facs_24_r_3_1_tl_58' n='N058'/>power. Ritual serves as a primary way
				<lb facs='#facs_24_r_3_1_tl_59' n='N059'/>of affirming commitment to that re
				<lb facs='#facs_24_r_3_1_tl_60' n='N060'/>assessment. The ritual setting provides
				<lb facs='#facs_24_r_3_1_tl_61' n='N061'/>a place for knowing the easy, direct
				<lb facs='#facs_24_r_3_1_tl_62' n='N062'/>exchange and sharing of power. 
				<lb facs='#facs_24_r_3_1_tl_63' n='N063'/>Certainly ritual is an idealized microcosmic
				<lb facs='#facs_24_r_3_1_tl_64' n='N064'/> experience, but it may be an 
				<lb facs='#facs_24_r_3_1_tl_65' n='N065'/>endurably important means of invoking a
				<lb facs='#facs_24_r_3_1_tl_66' n='N066'/>new order of things in the macrocosm.

				<lb facs='#facs_25_r_1_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>world for women might feel like.
				<lb facs='#facs_25_r_1_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>The word "feeling" deserves special
				<lb facs='#facs_25_r_1_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>mention in connection with women's
				<lb facs='#facs_25_r_1_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>rituals. In fact it is a word we must
				<lb facs='#facs_25_r_1_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>never neglect in talking about any ritual. 
				<lb facs='#facs_25_r_1_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>Evon Vogt once asked a ritual 
				<lb facs='#facs_25_r_1_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>participant, "Why do you go through the

				<lb facs='#facs_25_r_1_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>do?" The participant replied, "To fee
				<lb facs='#facs_25_r_1_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>better, I want to make myself feel better.""
				<lb facs='#facs_25_r_1_1_tl_12' n='N012'/> In the context of ritual women
				<lb facs='#facs_25_r_1_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>are creating a space in which to feel
				<lb facs='#facs_25_r_1_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>better, to feel more, to feel the past as
				<lb facs='#facs_25_r_1_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>well as the future. Perhaps most 
				<lb facs='#facs_25_r_1_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>important is the way in which ritual 
				<lb facs='#facs_25_r_1_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>upholds and celebrates the validity of
				<lb facs='#facs_25_r_1_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>feeling as a mode of revelation, 
				<lb facs='#facs_25_r_1_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>communication and transvaluation. In
				<lb facs='#facs_25_r_1_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>some of the rituals described above the
				<lb facs='#facs_25_r_1_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>flow of feelings, change in feelings or
				<lb facs='#facs_25_r_1_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>sharing of feelings with others is a highly 
				<lb facs='#facs_25_r_1_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>desirable goal in performing the ritual.
				<lb facs='#facs_25_r_1_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>In discussing the reasons underlying
				<lb facs='#facs_25_r_1_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>the performance of ritual acts in the
				<lb facs='#facs_25_r_1_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>feminist community, we must under
				<lb facs='#facs_25_r_1_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>score the importance of ritual as a
				<lb facs='#facs_25_r_1_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>formalized consecration of female
				<lb facs='#facs_25_r_1_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>bonding. The ritual concretization of
				<lb facs='#facs_25_r_1_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>the idea reflected in the popular 
				<lb facs='#facs_25_r_1_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>feminist slogan "Sisterhood is Powerful" is
				<lb facs='#facs_25_r_1_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>extremely important in demonstrating
				<lb facs='#facs_25_r_1_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>the cohesiveness and commitment of
				<lb facs='#facs_25_r_1_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>the feminist community. A primary
				<lb facs='#facs_25_r_1_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>function of ritual is to connect the 
				<lb facs='#facs_25_r_1_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>individual with the group—dramatically,
				<lb facs='#facs_25_r_1_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>indissoluably. In ritual the desire is to
				<lb facs='#facs_25_r_1_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>achieve shared meanings, shared 
				<lb facs='#facs_25_r_1_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>resolutions, shared emotion, not to 
				<lb facs='#facs_25_r_1_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>promote private images or dreams. The
				<lb facs='#facs_25_r_1_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>specific rites which comprise many
				<lb facs='#facs_25_r_1_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>feminist rituals reaffirm relationship,
				<lb facs='#facs_25_r_1_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>belonging and identity. Ritual acts
				<lb facs='#facs_25_r_1_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>maintain a symbolic center of which all
				<lb facs='#facs_25_r_1_1_tl_45' n='N045'/>the participants are aware. This center
				<lb facs='#facs_25_r_1_1_tl_46' n='N046'/>is a place to which one can return for
				<lb facs='#facs_25_r_1_1_tl_47' n='N047'/>support and comfort long after the
				<lb facs='#facs_25_r_1_1_tl_48' n='N048'/>ceremony has ended. A relational or
				<lb facs='#facs_25_r_1_1_tl_49' n='N049'/>ideological bond cemented formally
				<lb facs='#facs_25_r_1_1_tl_50' n='N050'/>through ritual procedure is nothing if
				<lb facs='#facs_25_r_1_1_tl_51' n='N051'/>not enduring.

				<lb facs='#facs_25_r_1_1_tl_55' n='N055'/>necessary for the success of any political 
				<lb facs='#facs_25_r_1_1_tl_56' n='N056'/>revolution. Let us not forget that

				<lb facs='#facs_25_r_1_1_tl_61' n='N061'/>It is already evident that women

				<lb facs='#facs_25_r_3_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>everyday life for feminists. The female
				<lb facs='#facs_25_r_3_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>bonds established in ritual lend 
				<lb facs='#facs_25_r_3_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>incentive to the female bonds that 
				<lb facs='#facs_25_r_3_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>inspire social change. The use of ritual
				<lb facs='#facs_25_r_3_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>is significant as a source for the
				<lb facs='#facs_25_r_3_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>renewal of commitment to evolving and
				<lb facs='#facs_25_r_3_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>transforming society as a whole.
				<lb facs='#facs_25_r_3_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>Many feminists in fact consider the
				<lb facs='#facs_25_r_3_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>ritual setting and experience to serve as
				<lb facs='#facs_25_r_3_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>a visionary mode. In feminist rituals
				<lb facs='#facs_25_r_3_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>which utilize peyote, a good portion of
				<lb facs='#facs_25_r_3_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>the night-long ceremony is given over
				<lb facs='#facs_25_r_3_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>to envisioning the future of the self,
				<lb facs='#facs_25_r_3_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>the group and the world. In authentic
				<lb facs='#facs_25_r_3_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>ritual experience something, an ability
				<lb facs='#facs_25_r_3_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>to break through the present, is available 
				<lb facs='#facs_25_r_3_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>which can lead to discovery and
				<lb facs='#facs_25_r_3_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>creativity. Ritual is a potent source of
				<lb facs='#facs_25_r_3_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>invention because the participants feel
				<lb facs='#facs_25_r_3_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>the extreme intensity, sometimes the
				<lb facs='#facs_25_r_3_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>ecstasy, of openness to possibility and
				<lb facs='#facs_25_r_3_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>revelation. This sense of extreme openness 
				<lb facs='#facs_25_r_3_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>and creativity is rare for women
				<lb facs='#facs_25_r_3_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>who have been traditionally circumscribed

				<lb facs='#facs_25_r_4_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>constrained by custom, with no hope for a

				<lb facs='#facs_25_r_4_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>Another important consideration is
				<lb facs='#facs_25_r_4_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>the way feminist ritual purposefully 
				<lb facs='#facs_25_r_4_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>imparts information of a special kind,
				<lb facs='#facs_25_r_4_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>information which has been unavailable

				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_1_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>symbols—none of these ritual actions
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_1_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>indicates a desire to return to a golden

				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_1_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>suggested. It is much more crucial for

				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_1_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>historical existence of a widespread
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_1_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>matriarchy. I have no doubt that some
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_1_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>matriarchies did exist. The important
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_1_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>consideration, however, is not the fact
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_1_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>that women ruled over men but that
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_1_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>they "ruled" themselves and that they
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_1_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>had culturally approved or at least
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_1_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>culturally active models for distinguishing 
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_1_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>their powers from others. In
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_1_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>many ancient civilizations the feminine 
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_1_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>world was not as anomalous'
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_1_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>as it currently is. Women had access
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_1_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>to powerful images and used them to
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_1_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>order and maintain their particular
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_1_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>spheres of life.
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_1_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>One of the most important shrines
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_1_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>in the pre-Conquest Mayan world was
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_1_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>located on Cozumel Island twenty
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_1_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>miles off the coast of the Yucatan.
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_1_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>It was dedicated to IxChel, the pre
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_1_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>eminent goddess of the moon, water,
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_1_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>childbirth, weaving and love, who was
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_1_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>equal in status to the great father god,
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_1_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>Itzamma. Her shrine was visited by
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_3_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>women from all over the Mayan world,
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_3_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>some traveling hundreds of miles from
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_3_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>Guatemala and El Salvador. Inside the
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_3_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>shrine a giant image of the goddess
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_3_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>served as an oracle for these women
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_3_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>pilgrims. The statue was hollowed out in
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_3_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>back; a priestess would stand in that pro
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_3_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>found cavity and impersonate the goddess, 
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_3_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>become a speaking image of the
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_3_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>goddess and in fact imagine herself the
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_4_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>goddess. To imagine is to make an
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_4_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>image or become an image; impersonation 
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_4_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>of this sort was an achievement of
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_4_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>relation with the goddess and a means
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_4_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>of absorbing her powers. Images are
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_4_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>sources of identification; they tell us
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_4_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>who we most profoundly, most arche
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_4_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>typally are. The Mayan women who visited 
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_4_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>the shrine at Cozumel were seeking 
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_4_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>affirmation of their own powers
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_4_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>(primarily the power to give birth, to be
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_4_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>fruitful) and they received it through
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_4_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>the pilgrimage itself (the association
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_4_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>with peers), idol worship (intense 
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_4_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>identification with an image) through the
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_4_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>blessing bestowed by the personified
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_4_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>goddess, the priestess.
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_4_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>Much the same identification is
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_4_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>sought and achieved in feminist rituals.
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_4_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>Ritual is a special vehicle of 
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_4_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>communication for feminists; ritual speaks a

				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_4_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>and provides an opportunity to
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_4_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>utilize them personally. Sherry Ortner
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_4_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>says that "Efforts directed solely at
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_4_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>changing the social institutions cannot

				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_4_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>power. If, as Vogt maintains, "Ritual
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_4_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>perpetuates knowledge essential to the

				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_4_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>knowledge through ritual means.
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_4_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>Much of the available data on women's

				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_4_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>the ritual. This is not always the case as
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_4_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>many rituals are performed without a
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_4_1_tl_45' n='N045'/>leader, including rituals which follow
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_4_1_tl_46' n='N046'/>a format and are repeated the same
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_4_1_tl_47' n='N047'/>way every time, rituals which rely on
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_4_1_tl_48' n='N048'/>group spontaneity, group meditation or
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_4_1_tl_49' n='N049'/>chanting, etc. Nevertheless, a number
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_4_1_tl_50' n='N050'/>of women in the feminist community
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_4_1_tl_51' n='N051'/>have emerged as ritualists, the counterpart 
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_4_1_tl_52' n='N052'/>to the shaman in traditional societies. 
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_4_1_tl_53' n='N053'/>Most women involved in introducing

				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_4_1_tl_55' n='N055'/>do not call themselves shamans or
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_4_1_tl_56' n='N056'/>think of themselves as such; they are
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_4_1_tl_57' n='N057'/>most widely known simply as ritualists
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_4_1_tl_58' n='N058'/>(or practitioners or witches if they ad

				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_4_1_tl_63' n='N063'/>performance are similar and, to a certain
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_4_1_tl_64' n='N064'/>extent, their conception of self is analogous.

			</p>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_6_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>is to effect transformation (i.e., to

				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_6_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>cases someone must prepare the group
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_6_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>to undergo change. A procedure must
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_6_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>be decided upon (in traditional societies, 
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_6_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>custom determines procedure)
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_6_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>and followed correctly to lead the 
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_6_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>participants from one state of feeling to
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_6_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>another. Both the shaman and feminist
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_6_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>ritualist make preparations and later
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_6_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>facilitate the group's progress in the
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_6_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>actual ritual; both are capable of helping
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_6_1_tl_13' n='N013'/> transformation to take place if the
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_6_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>participants will trust them. I am stressing 
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_6_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>here the fact that both shaman and
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_6_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>feminist ritualist express a powerful
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_6_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>sense of capability, that they can serve
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_6_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>as links, as surrogates, that they can
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_6_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>connect different realms of reality and
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_6_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>facilitate change by embodying change.
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_6_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>Both roles are played by individuals
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_6_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>who have changed and are concerned
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_6_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>with enabling the change of others.
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_6_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>Eliade says of the shaman: "He is,
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_6_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>above all, a sick man who has been
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_6_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>cured, who has succeeded in curing
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_6_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>himself."2 The feminist ritualist is also
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_6_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>one who has been "sick" in the sense
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_6_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>that oppression makes one feel sick.
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_6_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>She who is now cured of the tyranny of
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_6_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>oppression offers that new sense of
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_6_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>well-being to others. A traditional
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_6_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>shaman may become a "professional
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_6_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>transformer" practicing his art as oc
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_6_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>cupation whereas a feminist ritualist
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_6_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>may rise to the occasion of transformation 
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_6_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>only once in her lifetime (although
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_6_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>many ritualists practice somewhat regularly). 
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_6_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>Still, the necessity of their 
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_6_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>individual acceptance of their power to
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_6_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>change is crucial to the ultimate effect
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_6_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>of the ritual.
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_6_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>An obvious similarity between the
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_6_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>traditional shaman and the feminist
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_6_1_tl_45' n='N045'/>ritualist is that both do their work
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_6_1_tl_46' n='N046'/>through performing (singing, dancing,
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_6_1_tl_47' n='N047'/>displaying, holding, hugging) and,
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_6_1_tl_48' n='N048'/>moreover, the performance is quite
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_6_1_tl_49' n='N049'/>often geared to awakening and stimulating

			<pb n='27'/>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_1_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>ritualist and shaman see the body, not
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_1_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>the mind, as the locus of transformation. 
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_1_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>The body is our first and last outward 
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_1_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>reality; it defines and conditions
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_1_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>our life experience and gives us personal 
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_1_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>identity and continuity. Both
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_1_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>shaman and ritualist take the body to
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_1_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>be the clearest, purest expression of
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_1_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>self. And it is that aspect of self which
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_1_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>must feel change before the intellectual
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_1_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>or soul self can change. A chant I used
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_1_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>in a ritual performance called Seeing
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_1_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>the Voice expresses the bodily concerns
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_1_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>of the transformer:
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_1_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>My hands
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_1_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>Open the curtains of your being
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_1_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>Clothe you in a further nudity
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_1_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>Uncover the bodies of your body
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_1_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>My hands
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_1_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>Invent another body for your body 22
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_1_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>The body is also recognized by both,
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_1_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>especially by the ritualist as the means
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_1_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>for making conscious interconnections
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_1_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>and unions that were unconscious or
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_1_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>suppressed. Ritual, through those who
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_1_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>perform it, creates a new body, one
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_1_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>body made of many, through which
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_1_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>can be understood and realized the
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_1_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>extremes of fear and love, the truly
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_1_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>political dimensions of humanness.
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_1_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>Finally, the relation between the
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_1_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>shaman and his participant community
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_1_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>and the parallel relation between the
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_1_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>feminist ritualist and her participant
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_1_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>community bears notation. Richard
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_1_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>Schechner maintains that "the deep
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_1_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>structure of shamanistic performance
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_1_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>is a protagonist-antagonist conflict by
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_1_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>means of which the secret wishes of the
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_1_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>community are exposed and redis

				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_1_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>through which all that is powerful
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_1_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>chooses to express itself. And these
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_1_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>powers are inherent in community
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_1_1_tl_45' n='N045'/>itself, are the community."23 Thus
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_1_1_tl_46' n='N046'/>both shaman and ritualist exist 
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_1_1_tl_47' n='N047'/>primarily within a community and the
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_1_1_tl_48' n='N048'/>powers they exemplify ultimately be
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_1_1_tl_49' n='N049'/>long not to them as individuals but to
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_1_1_tl_50' n='N050'/>the community which is the actual
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_1_1_tl_51' n='N051'/>source of their power. The work of both
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_1_1_tl_52' n='N052'/>the shaman and the ritualist is to make
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_1_1_tl_53' n='N053'/>available, clarify and intensify powers
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_1_1_tl_54' n='N054'/>that are the essence of community.

				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_1_1_tl_57' n='N057'/>drawn between the artist and the ritualist. 
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_1_1_tl_58' n='N058'/>Here two items seem important
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_1_1_tl_59' n='N059'/>(1) feminist ritual has some of its deepest 
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_1_1_tl_60' n='N060'/>roots in the art of the 1960s and 70s
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_1_1_tl_61' n='N061'/>which gave rise to ritual-like forms
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_1_1_tl_62' n='N062'/>such as the happening and (2) some
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_1_1_tl_63' n='N063'/>feminist ritualists have come to ritual

			</p>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_2_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>previous interest in manipulating symbolic 
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_2_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>forms in other media (painting,
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_2_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>sculpture, film, etc.).
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_2_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>I said earlier that a primary objective
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_2_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>of ritual is to achieve shared meanings
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_2_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>and a sense of shared goals, not to promote 
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_2_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>private images or dreams. This is
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_2_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>the crucial difference between the ritualist 
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_2_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>and the artist. The artist takes
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_2_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>herself, her content and ability to ex
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_2_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>press that content as commendable to
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_2_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>the world of meaning and aesthetics.
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_2_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>She is a source of new meaning, novelty 
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_2_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>acting as a basis for determining 
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_2_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>accomplishment. The ritualist is constantly
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_4_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>at work to leave the self, to become
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_4_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>a channel for transcendent experience.

				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_4_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>through the manipulation of
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_4_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>dramatic forms — these are her aims. As
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_4_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>Donna Henes once told me in a personal
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_4_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>communication, "Making art

				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_4_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>anymore. The ritualist occupies a
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_4_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>unique space between individual and
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_4_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>group, between self-expression and
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_4_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>group cohesion. She is the exemplary
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_4_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>médiatrix, simultaneously the weaver
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_4_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>and the process of weaving. A quote
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_4_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>from Octavio Paz, though not written
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_4_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>with the ritualist in mind, helps to define
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_4_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>the sense she has of herself:
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_4_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>am the other when I am myself, my acts
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_4_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>are more my own when they are everybody's. 
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_4_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>Because to be myself I must be
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_4_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>other, go out of myself, seek myself

				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_4_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>if I do not exist.2
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_4_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>This dynamic of self loss and group
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_4_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>gain are epitomized as the ritualist's
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_4_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>view of her role is crucial to the transfer
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_4_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>of power which the ritual mode
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_4_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>promises. The ritualist defines her
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_4_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>sense of powerfulness by her capacity
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_4_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>to share it with others while the artist
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_5_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>is concerned with obtaining power
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_5_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>(through manipulation of media) and
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_5_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>maintaining it for others to observe or
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_5_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>partake of vicariously.
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_5_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>In stressing the communal nature of
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_5_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>the ritual experience, it may appear
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_5_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>that the concept of the self and its 
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_5_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>nurturance are served by some means
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_5_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>other than ritual. As the examples given
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_5_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>earlier indicate, some feminist rituals
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_5_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>are performed solely for the purpose of
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_5_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>self-revelation. From its inception the
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_5_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>women's movement has insisted on the
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_5_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>importance of realizing the way in
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_5_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>which political change comes out of re
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_5_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>interpretation and reinvention of the
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_5_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>personal dimension (the personal is
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_5_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>political). All women have suffered the
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_5_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>loss of affirmative, positive self-images
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_5_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>as a direct result of their second-class
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_5_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>status and consequent objectification
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_5_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>in the male-dominant society. It is 
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_5_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>painful to consider the countless lives 
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_5_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>wasted, the talents atrophied and the sickness
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_5_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>suffered by women who were
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_5_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>never allowed, least of all encouraged,
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_5_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>to know themselves and take strength
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_5_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>and happiness in that knowledge. Surely
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_5_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>one of the most highly regarded uses
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_5_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>of ritual in traditional societies is the
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_5_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>curing of "soul loss" of one form or an
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_5_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>other. Twentieth-century, postindustrial,
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_5_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>special-privileged American women
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_5_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>are engaged in ritual practice for much
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_5_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>the same reason, metaphorically speak
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_5_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>For women, the ritual setting is often
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_5_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>a place for naming individual powers
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_5_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>and sharing the affirmation of those
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_5_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>powers with the group or simply 
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_5_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>internalizing them through private ritual
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_5_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>procedure. Ritual provides a mode for
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_5_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>getting in touch with the self and staying
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_5_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>in touch. Also, by definition, the
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_5_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>ritual space and activity are sacred in
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_5_1_tl_45' n='N045'/>the sense of representing the possibility
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_5_1_tl_46' n='N046'/>of self-transformation. Part of the
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_5_1_tl_47' n='N047'/>power and the fear experienced in ritual
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_5_1_tl_48' n='N048'/>is the realization that one may change
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_5_1_tl_49' n='N049'/>become ultimately different, as a result
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_5_1_tl_50' n='N050'/>of the experience or that the experience
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_5_1_tl_51' n='N051'/>may suddenly make recognizable
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_5_1_tl_52' n='N052'/>change that has been slowly rising from
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_5_1_tl_53' n='N053'/>the depths of personality and ideology
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_5_1_tl_54' n='N054'/>Victor Turner states that "When a ritual
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_5_1_tl_55' n='N055'/>does work...it can cause, in some
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_5_1_tl_56' n='N056'/>cases real transformations of character
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_5_1_tl_57' n='N057'/>and of social relationships."25 I would
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_5_1_tl_58' n='N058'/>venture to say that many women have
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_5_1_tl_59' n='N059'/>been profoundly affected and, in some
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_5_1_tl_60' n='N060'/>cases, redirected through their experience 
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_5_1_tl_61' n='N061'/>in ritual. A lost self is recovered,
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_5_1_tl_62' n='N062'/>nurtured and allowed to emerge fully
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_5_1_tl_63' n='N063'/>named.
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_5_1_tl_64' n='N064'/>Ritual facilitates transition for the
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_5_1_tl_65' n='N065'/>participant in specific ways. As Turner
			</p>
			<pb n='28'/>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_1_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>clearly states, "Practically all rituals of
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_1_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>any length and complexity represent a
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_1_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>passage from one position, constellation, 
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_1_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>or domain or structure to an
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_1_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>other."26 This passage occurs in individual 
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_1_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>women most dramatically, and nos
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_1_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>without fear, separation anxiety and
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_1_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>trauma. Before women can enter new
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_1_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>roles they must leave old roles behind
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_1_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>roles that once provided the comforts
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_1_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>of self-definition and reality structure
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_1_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>Ritual participation can ease transition
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_1_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>by rendering it in dramatic, metaphorical 
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_1_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>terms and providing a support
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_1_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>group to encourage and enable the
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_1_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>necessary catharsis to take place
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_1_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>The transfer of values from one
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_1_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>framework to another leaves a woman
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_1_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>just as vulnerable, suspended between
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_1_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>two life styles. It is a dangerous time for
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_1_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>the individual, one which requires the
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_1_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>support of the feminist community and
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_1_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>the use of ritual to promote ease in the
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_1_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>transfer. Women are realizing that this
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_1_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>is a responsibility and a desire: to help
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_1_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>other women cross boundaries in their
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_1_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>lives not as aggressive individuals,
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_1_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>proving themselves, but as new members 
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_1_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>of a community who deserve the
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_1_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>help and protection of those who have
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_1_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>gone before. We have all been guarded
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_1_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>and we must all become guardians. The
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_1_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>ritual setting allows women to know
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_1_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>the power of guarding and the comfort
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_1_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>of being guarded in a space that does
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_1_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>not demand immediate resolution of
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_1_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>the passage crisis. The crisis period
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_1_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>may continue through many phases of
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_1_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>recognition, adjustment and readjustment, 
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_1_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>the assimilation of which will fall
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_1_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>primarily on the individual. But the
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_1_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>community has developed ritual means
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_1_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>by which that transformation may be
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_1_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>asserted and its painful aspects some

			</p>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_2_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>on the individual —a claim that she is
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_2_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>new, that she is one of many, that she is
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_2_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>welcome.
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_2_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>For feminists, as for other practitioners
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_2_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>of ritual, doing the ritual is more important 
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_2_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>than knowing the ritual. The
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_2_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>efficacy of ritual is always in the acting
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_2_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>of it, in becoming bodily involved with
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_2_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>the elements, not in understanding the
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_2_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>text of belief or ideology which may
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_2_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>underlie it. The essence of ritual is in
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_2_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>physical relationship, one woman to
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_2_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>another (or one woman to herself) in
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_2_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>the circle they have created for each

				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_2_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>This article only begins the necessary

				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_3_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>variations. The female is the matrix from which all mutation
				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_3_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>occurs. Biologically males are mutants.? Their ovaries have
				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_3_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>been electrochemically transmuted into testes, their clitorises
				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_3_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>into penises, whereas their mammaries and uteruses remain

				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_3_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>women, but the difference in form should be understood as
				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_3_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>one of frequency as well.
				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_3_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>... Einstein and other well-known physicists have noted the
				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_3_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>fact that matter is thought, vibrating at a lower frequen

				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_3_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>cyclical observation is still literally short-sighted, for energy
				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_3_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>spirals, which occasions its fluctuations, e.g., sine waves.

				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_4_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>chromosome, as everyone knows, is Y. Male energy is short

				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_4_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>Nowhere is the short-circuiting of the male more obvious
				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_4_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>than in the sex act. For this reason men who would attain spir
				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_4_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>ituality are advised to practice celibacy. Thus male religions
				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_4_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>have traditionally proscribed the rising snake of sexual ener

				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_4_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>Male religions have coopted the female principality in
				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_4_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>many ways. For example, Yin and Yang are recent male in
				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_4_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>ventions intended to give men a place in spiritual life, just
				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_4_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>as the acknowledgment of sexual reproduction gave them a
				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_4_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>role in family life. The comparison is revealing for, although
				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_4_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>concepts such as Yin and Yang appear to posit equality,
				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_4_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>men have taken for themselves superior spiritual roles, just
				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_4_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>as they have claimed supreme authority in the family, even
				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_4_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>though their role in reproduction is clearly secondary.
				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_4_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>The allocation of Yin, or passivity, to women is merely
				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_4_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>the most obvious part of the ruse. As every woman with a
				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_4_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>raised consciousness knows, women need not choose be
				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_4_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>tween activity and passivity. Women are capable of being
				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_4_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>both active and passive. It may even be said that in this re
				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_4_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>spect women are balanced, whereas men are imbalanced—
				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_4_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>overly "active.
				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_4_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>More important, the algebraic X signifies the unknown
				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_4_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>and is also the Greek letter psi as in psychic. X represents
				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_4_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>negative energy, the energy that dissolves the material world
				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_4_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>as in the X-ray process. Women (XX) actually transmit more
				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_4_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>negative (dematerializing), so-called passive energy than
				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_4_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>men (XY) do and can thus experience states of passivity (spir

				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_4_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>Originally the Yin-Yang symbol represented this essential
				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_4_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>eveness or Eve-ness. To perceive this inner meaning, one
				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_4_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>need only look deeply. Then the Yin-Yang symbol is revealed

				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_3_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>The following definition of Mikva is paraphrased from Rachel Adler: Mikva is a
				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_3_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>sacred water immersion place. Both men and women use the Mikva, but differently
				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_3_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>It is referred to in the Bible as ""mayim chayim", meaning living waters. Running
				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_3_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>water, not stagnant water. Any natural gathering of running water of requisite amount
				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_3_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>constitutes a natural Mikva: lake, river, sea.
				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_3_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>In cities, the Mikva is built using an approximation of natural water, that is, water
				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_3_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>collected through the force of gravity, usually rainwater. The rainwater is gathered
				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_3_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>into a huge container called the "bor" or pit. a building is constructed around this
				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_3_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>bor. The building contains small individual sunken pools for private immersion. Each
				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_3_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>pool shares a wall with the bor. Each shared wall has a hole cut in it which can be
				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_3_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>plugged up or left open. In order to make the adjoining pools into legally valid
				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_3_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>Makvaot, they are "seeded" with bor water and then filled with regular heated tap
				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_3_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>water. When the hole between this pool and the bor is unplugged so that the waters
				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_3_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>are touching (or, as the sources put it, "kissing"), the pool becomes a valid Mikva.

				<lb facs='#facs_58_r_3_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>trace his now steady, if only, imaginary lover.
				<lb facs='#facs_58_r_3_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>Imagine his shock, and self-disgust, upon coming

				<lb facs='#facs_58_r_3_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>Fortunately, no one saw him. By the time his

				<lb facs='#facs_58_r_3_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>Now, it was 4:30 a.m. He had had his coffee and

				<lb facs='#facs_58_r_3_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>He preferred to leave the lights on in all the inner

				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_2_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>looks as if it were made of stone. The green grass is

				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_2_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>hill. As i look, the figure rolls over toward me and i
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_2_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>can see that it is a large and sleeping goddess. As she
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_2_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>turns toward me i feel very happy. I realize she is my

				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_5_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>she's sensitive here. I am fascinated with how beau

				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_3_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>that they did not make. This is a matter of metaphysics,
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_3_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>whether we like that term or not, and it is necessary to
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_3_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>consider yet another distinction that derives from our
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_3_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>European western metaphysics—one that is alien to
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_3_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>Anasazi belief. We assume a distinction between "living
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_3_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>things, such as animals and plants, and "non-living" ones,
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_3_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>such as rocks and water. The distinction did not exist for
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_3_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>the early Anasazi people and still does not exist for many
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_3_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>of their present-day descendants. For the Anasazi/Hopi
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_3_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>trees, insects, rocks, people, water—are all living, vir
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_3_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>tually interconnected parts of a living Whole. Earth is
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_3_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>not just a huge chunk of inanimate matter with animate
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_3_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>beings scurrying around on top. Mother Earth is a living
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_3_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>being. Earth's creations cannot be reduced to inanimate
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_3_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>atomic particles, subject only to physio-chemical laws
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_3_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>because no such things exist. Atoms are alive, energized
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_3_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>by the same vitality that we experience.
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_3_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>Once we can view the world without separating the
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_3_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>animate from the inanimate, we can better understand
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_3_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>the interconnectedness of all things and the consequent
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_3_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>possibility for what we call psychic phenomena. For the
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_3_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>Anasazi, thought was not a mere epiphenomenon of a few
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_3_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>pounds of cerebral cortex but was in itself a vital, viable
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_3_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>powerful force that could and did affect things in the
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_3_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>world, such as the weather and other natural forces. Our
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_3_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>own orientation confuses us when we try to understand
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_3_1_tl_45' n='N045'/>this because as soon as we say "affect things," we assume
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_3_1_tl_46' n='N046'/>a linear version of cause and effect. The Anasazi held a
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_3_1_tl_47' n='N047'/>more complex concept of reality. Since they regarded all
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_3_1_tl_48' n='N048'/>things as related to each other, cause and effect were not
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_3_1_tl_49' n='N049'/>a simple matter of a one-two chain reaction, but rather a
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_3_1_tl_50' n='N050'/>complex interrelationship, a network, a pattern in which
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_3_1_tl_51' n='N051'/>they perceived cycles as well as lines, and subtle as well
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_3_1_tl_52' n='N052'/>as gross power.
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_4_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>The Anasazi expressed the metaphysical truth of the
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_4_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>interrelatedness of all things as parts in a great dynamic
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_4_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>Whole in their ceremonial dances. These multi-sensorial,
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_4_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>dynamic dramas were attuned to the cycles of nature
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_4_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>and the positions of certain stars. Within the ceremony
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_4_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>the movements of the dancers were synchronized with
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_4_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>each other and with repetitive, one-two drum beats, the
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_4_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>heartbeat of Mother Earth. Each ceremony in the cycle of
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_4_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>ceremonies was simultaneously a complete, orchestrated
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_4_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>unit as well as an integral part of the Whole cycle. Anal
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_4_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>ogously, each individual participant was an integral part
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_4_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>of the great dynamic Whole of the dance, the cycle, and
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_4_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>all of nature.
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_4_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>Anasazi architecture played an important part in the
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_4_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>ceremonial expressions of this primary truth. The photo
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_4_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>graphs accompanying this essay are of Anasazi pueblo
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_4_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>ruins in Chaco Canyon, New Mexico that were built be
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_4_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>tween 1000 and 1200 A.D. Some of the more extensive
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_4_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>pueblos span about three acres. In some cases pueblos are
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_4_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>built on top of even older ruins, which had been aban
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_4_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>doned by earlier generations of Anasazi. The ceremonial
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_4_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>temples, called kivas, were dug out of the earth, so that
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_4_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>they are wholly or partially subterranean. The kiva illus
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_4_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>trated here is a subterranean Great Kiva and was probably
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_4_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>used by a group of about 1000 people. Smaller kivas were
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_4_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>also at least partially underground and usually circular
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_4_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>Each kiva contained a sipapu, a circular hole dug out of
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_4_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>the floor. The sipapu symbolized the place of emergence
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_4_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>from the last world
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_4_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>Kivas were a part of the daily life of the Anasazi, as
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_4_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>were their spiritual practices. They were used constantly
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_4_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>for ceremonial preparations and rituals.2 For the architects
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_4_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>of these buildings, there was no distinction between the
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_4_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>spiritual and the political, i.e., between their religious and
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_4_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>secular lives—or for that matter between art and non-art
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_4_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>Religion and art were an integral part of daily life. The
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_4_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>Anasazi's ritual ceremonies celebrated life and their daily
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_4_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>lives celebrated the beauty of a total reality, naturally in
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_4_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>cluding what we call the spiritual
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_4_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>The Anasazi ceremonies were held either inside the
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_4_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>circular, partially underground kivas or in the plaza,
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_4_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>framed by these concentric, step-like buildings. As Vin
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_4_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>cent Scully says, "Most of the dances of ritual ...are
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_4_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>held, now as in the recorded past, tight up against the
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_4_1_tl_45' n='N045'/>buildings. .. And the beat of those dances is built into the
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_4_1_tl_46' n='N046'/>architecture, which thus dances too."3
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_4_1_tl_47' n='N047'/>The architecture's very structure expressed the meta
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_4_1_tl_48' n='N048'/>physical belief in the interdependence and interconnect
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_4_1_tl_49' n='N049'/>edness of all things in a dynamic Whole. The pueblo was

				<lb facs='#facs_93_r_3_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>ing the egalitarian social belief of the Anasazi. Each of
				<lb facs='#facs_93_r_3_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>these cellular units was owned by a woman. The Anasazi
				<lb facs='#facs_93_r_3_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>were matrilineal and matrilocal. When a daughter mar
				<lb facs='#facs_93_r_3_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>ried, a unit was built adjacent to that of her mother anc
				<lb facs='#facs_93_r_3_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>she and her husband moved in. (In case of divorce, the
				<lb facs='#facs_93_r_3_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>man moved out, leaving the woman in a relatively more
				<lb facs='#facs_93_r_3_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>secure position, since she had the house and the support
				<lb facs='#facs_93_r_3_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>of her own clan.) The layout of the Anasazi pueblo was a
				<lb facs='#facs_93_r_3_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>direct result of this matrilocal arrangement: Construction
				<lb facs='#facs_93_r_3_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>occurred only where daughters were born. A family that
				<lb facs='#facs_93_r_3_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>had many daughters could be evidenced by a cluster o
				<lb facs='#facs_93_r_3_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>pueblo units. In an area of the pueblo where only sons
				<lb facs='#facs_93_r_3_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>were born, new construction did not take place; in fact
				<lb facs='#facs_93_r_3_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>because the clans were matrilineal, a clan that failed to
				<lb facs='#facs_93_r_3_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>have daughters became extinct.
				<lb facs='#facs_93_r_3_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>Laura Thompson points out the value in this kind of
				<lb facs='#facs_93_r_3_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>growth pattern: "Reproduction in this organically con
				<lb facs='#facs_93_r_3_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>ceived society is ideally by means of budding. As the Hop
				<lb facs='#facs_93_r_3_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>matrilineal clan grows by adding daughter households to
				<lb facs='#facs_93_r_3_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>the mother unit, so the pueblo expands by the budding of
				<lb facs='#facs_93_r_3_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>daughter colonies from the original nucleus. Thus ideally
				<lb facs='#facs_93_r_3_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>the society is able to augment and completely recon
				<lb facs='#facs_93_r_3_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>stitute itself."
				<lb facs='#facs_93_r_3_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>This budding type of growth pattern is different from
				<lb facs='#facs_93_r_3_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>that of our architecture. For us, the basic structural unit is
				<lb facs='#facs_93_r_3_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>the building to which new rooms, patios, etc., can be
				<lb facs='#facs_93_r_3_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>added. Pueblo architecture's basic structural unit is the
				<lb facs='#facs_93_r_3_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>room itself, and growth consists of indefinite repetition of
				<lb facs='#facs_93_r_3_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>this basic unit. Although J.B. Jackson seems to consider
				<lb facs='#facs_93_r_3_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>this growth pattern inferior to our more "complex" way of
				<lb facs='#facs_93_r_3_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>building, he points out that it seems to imply "the belies
				<lb facs='#facs_93_r_3_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>in the cumulative power of infinite repetition."» This be
				<lb facs='#facs_93_r_3_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>lief is also reflected in the Chaco Canyon masonry, which
				<lb facs='#facs_93_r_3_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>prefers small stones to large ones. Jackson says, "It is as i
				<lb facs='#facs_93_r_3_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>the builders were saying that a wall is sturdy when it is
				<lb facs='#facs_93_r_3_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>made out of a multitude of identical small fragments."6
				<lb facs='#facs_93_r_3_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>think it is likely that these builders, who were members of
				<lb facs='#facs_93_r_3_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>a matrilineal, egalitarian society and who expressed their
				<lb facs='#facs_93_r_3_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>spiritual beliefs via repetitive, cyclic ceremonies, did
				<lb facs='#facs_93_r_3_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>believe in the "cumulative power of infinite repetition.
				<lb facs='#facs_93_r_3_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>That idea seems difficult for Jackson to honor, but then he

				<lb facs='#facs_93_r_4_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>radically differ from those of Anasazi society
				<lb facs='#facs_93_r_4_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>Probably the most dramatic difference between Ana
				<lb facs='#facs_93_r_4_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>sazi architecture and ours is the relationship of its forms
				<lb facs='#facs_93_r_4_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>to the earth. This difference is most marked in the struc
				<lb facs='#facs_93_r_4_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>ture of the kivas. European influenced churches are
				<lb facs='#facs_93_r_4_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>capped with phallic steeples, straining to leave the earth
				<lb facs='#facs_93_r_4_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>to reach the male God in the sky; arches cleave walls well
				<lb facs='#facs_93_r_4_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>above human height, pointing to the same exalted being
				<lb facs='#facs_93_r_4_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>By total contrast, Anasazi architecture hugs Mother Earth,
				<lb facs='#facs_93_r_4_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>and the most sacred is the lowest and most enveloped
				<lb facs='#facs_93_r_4_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>Kivas are dug out of the earth and are usually circular
				<lb facs='#facs_93_r_4_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>reflecting earth's form." The most sacred part of the entire
				<lb facs='#facs_93_r_4_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>pueblo, the sipapu, the place of emergence from the last
				<lb facs='#facs_93_r_4_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>world, is dug deep into the already subterranean kiva.
				<lb facs='#facs_93_r_4_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>This sacred orifice is protected by the circular kiva, whose
				<lb facs='#facs_93_r_4_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>walls may be of many thicknesses. The kiva is in turn sur
				<lb facs='#facs_93_r_4_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>rounded by the pueblo, which may also have a concentric
				<lb facs='#facs_93_r_4_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>layout.
				<lb facs='#facs_93_r_4_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>The concentric arrangement of the kivas may reflect
				<lb facs='#facs_93_r_4_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>the matrifocused spiritual beliefs of the Anasazi. The
				<lb facs='#facs_93_r_4_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>walls of some kivas are nearly two feet thick.? They are
				<lb facs='#facs_93_r_4_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>made up of stones, mortar, layers of plaster and (some
				<lb facs='#facs_93_r_4_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>times) paint. Frank C. Hibben reports that "In some kivas
				<lb facs='#facs_93_r_4_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>having many painted coats of plaster, the layers them
				<lb facs='#facs_93_r_4_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>selves made up perhaps a third of the thickness of the
				<lb facs='#facs_93_r_4_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>walls."9 These concentric layers symbolically protect the
				<lb facs='#facs_93_r_4_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>sipapu and the people inside the kiva. For the Anasazi,
				<lb facs='#facs_93_r_4_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>Hopi, two types of labyrinth symbolize Mother Earth a
				<lb facs='#facs_93_r_4_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>she enfolds each soul, gives it birth and receives the spirit
				<lb facs='#facs_93_r_4_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>back at the end of the person's path through life."

				<lb facs='#facs_94_r_1_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>The same symbolism seems to be the underlying mo
				<lb facs='#facs_94_r_1_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>tive of the layout of the pueblo itself. There are two basic
				<lb facs='#facs_94_r_1_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>kinds of ground plan apparent in the pueblos throughout
				<lb facs='#facs_94_r_1_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>the Southwest that echo the two maze shapes. One is a
				<lb facs='#facs_94_r_1_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>sort of semicircular or capital letter D shape (analogous to
				<lb facs='#facs_94_r_1_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>Figure 1); the other is a more rectangular, roughly E shape
				<lb facs='#facs_94_r_1_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>—sometimes with the center bar missing (analogous to
				<lb facs='#facs_94_r_1_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>Figure 2). All of the rooms on any one level of a pueblo
				<lb facs='#facs_94_r_1_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>are connected by doorways, so that it is possible to enter
				<lb facs='#facs_94_r_1_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>a room at one end and wind one's way through the rooms
				<lb facs='#facs_94_r_1_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>to the other end. The multiple rows of rooms arranged
				<lb facs='#facs_94_r_1_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>around a central plaza create a concentric, centripetal
				<lb facs='#facs_94_r_1_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>design. That this labyrinthine structure was intended to
				<lb facs='#facs_94_r_1_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>symbolize Mother Earth is at least plausible; if it does, this
				<lb facs='#facs_94_r_1_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>is another way in which the Anasazi expressed their spir

				<lb facs='#facs_94_r_1_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>We have already discussed the intimate connection
				<lb facs='#facs_94_r_1_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>between the Anasazi's matrifocused society and the
				<lb facs='#facs_94_r_1_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>growth pattern of their architecture, and between the
				<lb facs='#facs_94_r_1_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>matrifocused spiritual beliefs and the structure of their
				<lb facs='#facs_94_r_1_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>kivas, if not the entire pueblo complex. But it is even
				<lb facs='#facs_94_r_1_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>more interesting to realize that this architecture was to a
				<lb facs='#facs_94_r_1_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>great extent built by women. Apparently the division of
				<lb facs='#facs_94_r_1_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>labor was that the men cut and laid the timber (which
				<lb facs='#facs_94_r_1_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>made the ceilings and partially framed the doors) and the
				<lb facs='#facs_94_r_1_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>women built the walls. It is not common knowledge
				<lb facs='#facs_94_r_1_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>among anthropologists that women were the major par
				<lb facs='#facs_94_r_1_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>ticipants in building some of the most spectacular archi
				<lb facs='#facs_94_r_1_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>tecture in North America."" Not surprisingly, I came
				<lb facs='#facs_94_r_1_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>across this bit of information in male literature, which
				<lb facs='#facs_94_r_1_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>mentioned it in the process of denigrating women. The
				<lb facs='#facs_94_r_1_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>following passage, written by George Kubler, was based
				<lb facs='#facs_94_r_1_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>on the records of the seventeenth century Franciscan
				<lb facs='#facs_94_r_1_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>missionary Benavides. The passage blames certain "neg

				<lb facs='#facs_94_r_1_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>in its construction, and in the process indicates that wom
				<lb facs='#facs_94_r_1_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>en built pueblo walls in ancient times. I quote this passage
				<lb facs='#facs_94_r_1_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>at length because its ethnocentricity and phallocentricity
				<lb facs='#facs_94_r_1_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>are so appallingly blatant as to be humorous (in an adren
				<lb facs='#facs_94_r_1_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>alin-producing kind of way):
				<lb facs='#facs_94_r_1_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>"The evidence of the buildings constitutes proof that two
				<lb facs='#facs_94_r_1_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>commonplace devices of European building found no use
				<lb facs='#facs_94_r_1_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>in New Mexico during the missionary era. The arch is al
				<lb facs='#facs_94_r_1_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>most nonexistent, and the dome is completely lacking, but
				<lb facs='#facs_94_r_1_1_tl_45' n='N045'/>both forms may readily be built with the local materials.
				<lb facs='#facs_94_r_1_1_tl_46' n='N046'/>Why were they excluded from the architectural repertory of
				<lb facs='#facs_94_r_1_1_tl_47' n='N047'/>the mission buildings? It is to be recalled that, to this day,
				<lb facs='#facs_94_r_1_1_tl_48' n='N048'/>the Indians themselves never use either the arch or the
				<lb facs='#facs_94_r_1_1_tl_49' n='N049'/>dome. In dealing with these negative aspects of the struc

				<lb facs='#facs_94_r_1_1_tl_51' n='N051'/>vides, pertaining to the participation of women in con
				<lb facs='#facs_94_r_1_1_tl_52' n='N052'/>struction. Since Benavides, the roles have been reversed
				<lb facs='#facs_94_r_1_1_tl_53' n='N053'/>the women now spin and weave, and the men build walls.
				<lb facs='#facs_94_r_1_1_tl_54' n='N054'/>But the women own the houses in the pueblos, and the
				<lb facs='#facs_94_r_1_1_tl_55' n='N055'/>ownership itself is perhaps a remnant from the time when
				<lb facs='#facs_94_r_1_1_tl_56' n='N056'/>building was the women's prerogative. Does this indif

				<lb facs='#facs_94_r_1_1_tl_59' n='N059'/>resistance was encountered in New Mexico. .. and it seem:
				<lb facs='#facs_94_r_1_1_tl_60' n='N060'/>reasonable to localize this resistance in the participation of
				<lb facs='#facs_94_r_1_1_tl_61' n='N061'/>women. The point cannot be proved by asserting that

			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_94_r_4_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>certainly doubt that the absence of domes and arches
				<lb facs='#facs_94_r_4_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>is due to the women's laziness, as Kubler suggests. Nor

				<lb facs='#facs_95_r_4_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>crucially important to the traditional Hopi is prophetic
				<lb facs='#facs_95_r_4_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>visions. The Hopi have been guided by visions for count
				<lb facs='#facs_95_r_4_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>less centuries. In fact, visions guided the people to Chaco
				<lb facs='#facs_95_r_4_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>Canyon after many hundreds of years of migration through
				<lb facs='#facs_95_r_4_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>out North and South America.18 It is here that the Anazasi
				<lb facs='#facs_95_r_4_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>built their earthen architecture and here that their de
				<lb facs='#facs_95_r_4_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>scendants still choose to live.
				<lb facs='#facs_95_r_4_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>The white man's appearance in Pueblo country was
				<lb facs='#facs_95_r_4_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>prophesied long before he came. The prophesies predict
				<lb facs='#facs_95_r_4_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>ed that if the white man came bearing the sign of the
				<lb facs='#facs_95_r_4_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>circle, he would live in beneficial harmony with the Hopi
				<lb facs='#facs_95_r_4_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>But if he came bearing the sign of the cross, he had lost
				<lb facs='#facs_95_r_4_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>his true belief and would bring sickness and death with
				<lb facs='#facs_95_r_4_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>him. The Anasazi women understood all too well the real
				<lb facs='#facs_95_r_4_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>meaning of the cross crowning the missions that they were
				<lb facs='#facs_95_r_4_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>forced to build.
				<lb facs='#facs_95_r_4_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>The prophetic visions revealed that this new race of
				<lb facs='#facs_95_r_4_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>people would be able to fly through the air and would
				<lb facs='#facs_95_r_4_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>speak to each other through what appeared in the visions
				<lb facs='#facs_95_r_4_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>to be "cobwebs in the sky." The visions also foretold of a
				<lb facs='#facs_95_r_4_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>road "like a ribbon" that would run through the Hopi
				<lb facs='#facs_95_r_4_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>villages. Hopi men were later forced to build such a road
				<lb facs='#facs_95_r_4_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>while working on chain gangs as punishment for resisting
				<lb facs='#facs_95_r_4_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>government attempts to educate their children.
				<lb facs='#facs_95_r_4_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>Many of the prophesies have become realities, but
				<lb facs='#facs_95_r_4_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>there are still more that pertain to the future. A crucial
				<lb facs='#facs_95_r_4_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>prophecy, still unfolding, is that men will come to try to
				<lb facs='#facs_95_r_4_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>take what lies under Hopi land. All of Mother Earth is
				<lb facs='#facs_95_r_4_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>sacred to the Hopi. They believe that they live at the very
				<lb facs='#facs_95_r_4_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>heart of this continent, the geomagnetic center—and that
				<lb facs='#facs_95_r_4_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>tampering with Mother Earth at this sacred center will
				<lb facs='#facs_95_r_4_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>create a serious imbalance. The prophecy warns that the
				<lb facs='#facs_95_r_4_1_tl_45' n='N045'/>people should not let the men take what is under their
				<lb facs='#facs_95_r_4_1_tl_46' n='N046'/>land. For the Hopi who have been indoctrinated into the
				<lb facs='#facs_95_r_4_1_tl_47' n='N047'/>white man's world view, a view in which prophetic visions
				<lb facs='#facs_95_r_4_1_tl_48' n='N048'/>are not valued, such a warning has little meaning. Yet
				<lb facs='#facs_95_r_4_1_tl_49' n='N049'/>those who have managed to cling to their ancient world
				<lb facs='#facs_95_r_4_1_tl_50' n='N050'/>view and spiritual knowledge take the warning very
				<lb facs='#facs_95_r_4_1_tl_51' n='N051'/>seriously. These people will try to protect Mother Earth
				<lb facs='#facs_95_r_4_1_tl_52' n='N052'/>from strip-mining
				<lb facs='#facs_95_r_4_1_tl_53' n='N053'/>Ecology-minded feminists may oppose strip-mining
				<lb facs='#facs_95_r_4_1_tl_54' n='N054'/>and see the struggle of the Hopi with the U.S. government
				<lb facs='#facs_95_r_4_1_tl_55' n='N055'/>as a political situation. The Hopi know it is a political
				<lb facs='#facs_95_r_4_1_tl_56' n='N056'/>and a spiritual struggle. For them, the concepts of "polit

				<lb facs='#facs_98_r_7_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>For some years I had been attempting to make
				<lb facs='#facs_98_r_7_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>a pilgrimage to a Goddess site. I had been doing
				<lb facs='#facs_98_r_7_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>private rituals in my art for some time, both out
				<lb facs='#facs_98_r_7_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>doors in nature and in the studio. I could feed off
				<lb facs='#facs_98_r_7_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>of them and hold them in my mind like totems.
				<lb facs='#facs_98_r_7_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>but I was still hungry. I needed to do my rituals in
				<lb facs='#facs_98_r_7_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>an actual prehistoric cave; to experience a Neo
				<lb facs='#facs_98_r_7_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>lithic site where I could smell the earth, poke
				<lb facs='#facs_98_r_7_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>around in the soil, breathe the air, and know that
				<lb facs='#facs_98_r_7_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>the cave air had circulated through my body and
				<lb facs='#facs_98_r_7_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>become a part of me. To go to a prehistoric site
				<lb facs='#facs_98_r_7_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>became an obsession, and represented the place
				<lb facs='#facs_98_r_7_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>to begin a new cycle. Numerous grants had not
				<lb facs='#facs_98_r_7_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>materialized and the trip was long overdue. I sold
				<lb facs='#facs_98_r_7_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>my car and bought the voyage.
				<lb facs='#facs_98_r_7_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>Before leaving New York, I researched seven
				<lb facs='#facs_98_r_7_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>sites in hopes of being able to locate and gain
				<lb facs='#facs_98_r_7_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>access to at least one of them. I had been there
				<lb facs='#facs_98_r_7_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>in my head many times.) My attraction to Yugo

				<lb facs='#facs_98_r_7_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>gists, came from my wanting to start with a
				<lb facs='#facs_98_r_7_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>civilization linked to both the earliest Goddess
				<lb facs='#facs_98_r_7_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>worship and its art forms as well as to the later
				<lb facs='#facs_98_r_7_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>Goddess worshipping cultures. My fantasy and my
				<lb facs='#facs_98_r_7_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>plans are to continue my pilgrimage in the coming
				<lb facs='#facs_98_r_7_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>years throughout the Mediterranean, to trace our

				<lb facs='#facs_98_r_7_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>After arriving on the island of Hvar in the
				<lb facs='#facs_98_r_7_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>Adriatic off the coast of Yugoslavia, I set out to

				<lb facs='#facs_99_r_1_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>proved to be word-of-mouth. In Jelsa, we (Anne
				<lb facs='#facs_99_r_1_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>Healy and I were traveling together) tried to find
				<lb facs='#facs_99_r_1_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>someone who spoke English and knew the where
				<lb facs='#facs_99_r_1_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>abouts of the Grapceva spilja, chosen because it
				<lb facs='#facs_99_r_1_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>appeared that I could be alone there. Little atten

				<lb facs='#facs_99_r_1_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>excavation in 1955 by Professor Grya Novak.
				<lb facs='#facs_99_r_1_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>thought, from reading and intuition, that this cave
				<lb facs='#facs_99_r_1_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>was probably used as a sanctuary by Neolithic
				<lb facs='#facs_99_r_1_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>people.
				<lb facs='#facs_99_r_1_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>The travel agent in Jelsa said flatly that no one
				<lb facs='#facs_99_r_1_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>could tell us where the cave was, assuring us that
				<lb facs='#facs_99_r_1_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>he had lived in the area all his life and had never
				<lb facs='#facs_99_r_1_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>seen it. Obviously it was not worth bothering with.
				<lb facs='#facs_99_r_1_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>Finally, we wangled out of him that a villager,
				<lb facs='#facs_99_r_1_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>now retired, had led excursions by donkey up the
				<lb facs='#facs_99_r_1_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>steep mountain to the cave. The agent had trouble
				<lb facs='#facs_99_r_1_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>remembering the guide's name, but at last it came
				<lb facs='#facs_99_r_1_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>out: "Vicko.

				<lb facs='#facs_99_r_1_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>This done, we were on the threshold of a house
				<lb facs='#facs_99_r_1_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>where we were offered old world hospitality and
				<lb facs='#facs_99_r_1_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>an abundance of homemade wine. Yes, he was
				<lb facs='#facs_99_r_1_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>too old to go up the mountain, but his fourteen
				<lb facs='#facs_99_r_1_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>year-old son knew the way
				<lb facs='#facs_99_r_1_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>At daybreak the next morning we began the
				<lb facs='#facs_99_r_1_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>trip, climbing on and on while we and the heavy
				<lb facs='#facs_99_r_1_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>camera gear baked in the intense sun. At the top
				<lb facs='#facs_99_r_1_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>of the mountain, beyond the deserted village of
				<lb facs='#facs_99_r_1_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>Humac, we began our descent to the barely acces
				<lb facs='#facs_99_r_1_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>sible cave. The climb down was a series of straight
				<lb facs='#facs_99_r_1_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>drops. What had once been a path was now acres
				<lb facs='#facs_99_r_1_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>of mountain stone, obscuring the way to those
				<lb facs='#facs_99_r_1_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>unfamiliar with it. Suddenly the blue Adriatic
				<lb facs='#facs_99_r_1_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>stretched before us, and in the next moment, we
				<lb facs='#facs_99_r_1_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>realized that we had reached the area around the
				<lb facs='#facs_99_r_1_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>cave. What an incredible location: the sea vista, a
				<lb facs='#facs_99_r_1_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>shelf of flat rock extending from the front of the
				<lb facs='#facs_99_r_1_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>cave, fruit and nut trees and berry bushes on
				<lb facs='#facs_99_r_1_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>either side. We could easily visualize the daily
				<lb facs='#facs_99_r_1_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>activities of the Neolithic inhabitants gathered
				<lb facs='#facs_99_r_1_1_tl_45' n='N045'/>there, talking, cooking, sunning.
				<lb facs='#facs_99_r_1_1_tl_46' n='N046'/>Vicko's son unlocked the gate placed over the
				<lb facs='#facs_99_r_1_1_tl_47' n='N047'/>mouth of the cave. I can think of our entrance
				<lb facs='#facs_99_r_1_1_tl_48' n='N048'/>only in personal terms. It is very difficult to con
				<lb facs='#facs_99_r_1_1_tl_49' n='N049'/>vey how thrilling this experience was to me. The
				<lb facs='#facs_99_r_1_1_tl_50' n='N050'/>cave was dazzling. It was magnificent. The main
				<lb facs='#facs_99_r_1_1_tl_51' n='N051'/>room, the great hall, sparkled and glistened with
				<lb facs='#facs_99_r_1_1_tl_52' n='N052'/>coral quartz. Stalagmites and stalactites, suggest
				<lb facs='#facs_99_r_1_1_tl_53' n='N053'/>ing great temple pillars, divided the rooms into
				<lb facs='#facs_99_r_1_1_tl_54' n='N054'/>chambers. The atmosphere created a feeling of
				<lb facs='#facs_99_r_1_1_tl_55' n='N055'/>reverence and awe. For me, it was a holy place.
				<lb facs='#facs_99_r_1_1_tl_56' n='N056'/>Vicko's son began to dig in the floor of the
				<lb facs='#facs_99_r_1_1_tl_57' n='N057'/>cave and shortly produced some bones. As it
				<lb facs='#facs_99_r_1_1_tl_58' n='N058'/>turned out, there were bones, shards and shells
				<lb facs='#facs_99_r_1_1_tl_59' n='N059'/>everywhere. But the cave completely lacked light
				<lb facs='#facs_99_r_1_1_tl_60' n='N060'/>and the few candles we had did not begin to

				<lb facs='#facs_100_r_1_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>penetrate the surrounding darkness. Although our
				<lb facs='#facs_100_r_1_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>eyes could pick up a faint glimmer, a camera
				<lb facs='#facs_100_r_1_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>could not record more than the light of the candle
				<lb facs='#facs_100_r_1_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>itself. After resting, we headed down the mountain
				<lb facs='#facs_100_r_1_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>to ask Vicko whether Anne and I could have the
				<lb facs='#facs_100_r_1_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>key to the gate to go back by ourselves the next
				<lb facs='#facs_100_r_1_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>day.
				<lb facs='#facs_100_r_1_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>The following morning we set out with two
				<lb facs='#facs_100_r_1_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>dozen candles and three Yugoslav flashlights. First,
				<lb facs='#facs_100_r_1_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>wanted to explore the cave for myself. The low
				<lb facs='#facs_100_r_1_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>contracted entrance to the cave opened into an
				<lb facs='#facs_100_r_1_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>anteroom or anterior hall with a side chapel of the
				<lb facs='#facs_100_r_1_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>darkest and richest coral quartz imaginable. Lead
				<lb facs='#facs_100_r_1_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>ing into the great hall, a vaulted ceiling with two
				<lb facs='#facs_100_r_1_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>massive stalagmites, which had become pillars,
				<lb facs='#facs_100_r_1_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>added to the majesty of the grotto. A dip in the
				<lb facs='#facs_100_r_1_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>middle of the hall—no doubt formed from cen
				<lb facs='#facs_100_r_1_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>turies of use—was a natural center. To the left
				<lb facs='#facs_100_r_1_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>side, chambers formed by smaller stalagmites
				<lb facs='#facs_100_r_1_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>turned into narrow passages melting one into
				<lb facs='#facs_100_r_1_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>another, curving downwards or upwards. Nature
				<lb facs='#facs_100_r_1_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>had produced a complex labyrinth of sanctuaries.
				<lb facs='#facs_100_r_1_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>Five "lofts, which circled the back of the great
				<lb facs='#facs_100_r_1_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>hall and extended into the chamber rooms about
				<lb facs='#facs_100_r_1_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>five feet above the floor of the cave, were large
				<lb facs='#facs_100_r_1_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>enough to sleep three or four people. The largest
				<lb facs='#facs_100_r_1_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>caught my attention in particular because, unlike
				<lb facs='#facs_100_r_1_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>the others, its floor and ceiling were jet black with
				<lb facs='#facs_100_r_1_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>specks of mother-of-pearl imbedded in the surface.
				<lb facs='#facs_100_r_1_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>Many of the pots recovered from the cave were
				<lb facs='#facs_100_r_1_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>made from this black clay; others were made from
				<lb facs='#facs_100_r_1_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>more traditional red clays.
				<lb facs='#facs_100_r_1_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>crawled into the space where, deep in one
				<lb facs='#facs_100_r_1_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>corner, crouching to examine a broken area in the
				<lb facs='#facs_100_r_1_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>black floor, I found pure dark red clay, which was
				<lb facs='#facs_100_r_1_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>the right consistency, moisture content and tex
				<lb facs='#facs_100_r_1_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>ture to begin making a pot without further prepar
				<lb facs='#facs_100_r_1_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>ation. I wondered whether this blackened room
				<lb facs='#facs_100_r_1_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>could have been a kiln room. The clay, ready to
				<lb facs='#facs_100_r_1_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>use, could have been dried near the kiln and fired
				<lb facs='#facs_100_r_1_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>in the same place, a perfect set-up. An indoor
				<lb facs='#facs_100_r_1_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>kiln might have also driven out the dampness, the
				<lb facs='#facs_100_r_1_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>only aspect of the cave I found uncomfortable.
				<lb facs='#facs_100_r_1_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>Considering the surroundings, I began to revise my
				<lb facs='#facs_100_r_1_1_tl_45' n='N045'/>notions of the hardships of primitive life—at least
				<lb facs='#facs_100_r_1_1_tl_46' n='N046'/>in this location. The temperature and quality of
				<lb facs='#facs_100_r_1_1_tl_47' n='N047'/>the air, in spite of the heat outdoors, were far
				<lb facs='#facs_100_r_1_1_tl_48' n='N048'/>superior to our air-conditioning. In one corner of
				<lb facs='#facs_100_r_1_1_tl_49' n='N049'/>the cave, a constant trickle of water provided a
				<lb facs='#facs_100_r_1_1_tl_50' n='N050'/>natural water supply. Fruits, nuts and herbs were
				<lb facs='#facs_100_r_1_1_tl_51' n='N051'/>at the doorstep, and the scent of lavender filled
				<lb facs='#facs_100_r_1_1_tl_52' n='N052'/>the air. The black crust of clay on the surface of
				<lb facs='#facs_100_r_1_1_tl_53' n='N053'/>the "kiln" loft wall was thin; scratching through
				<lb facs='#facs_100_r_1_1_tl_54' n='N054'/>it I came to a bright white, and began to make the
				<lb facs='#facs_100_r_1_1_tl_55' n='N055'/>impresso patterns common to the area in Neo
				<lb facs='#facs_100_r_1_1_tl_56' n='N056'/>lithic times. In a few strokes I felt one long hand
				<lb facs='#facs_100_r_1_1_tl_57' n='N057'/>extending across time, sending a jolt of energy
				<lb facs='#facs_100_r_1_1_tl_58' n='N058'/>into my body. I began my rituals.
				<lb facs='#facs_100_r_1_1_tl_59' n='N059'/>The energy from the rituals seemed to pulsate
				<lb facs='#facs_100_r_1_1_tl_60' n='N060'/>from the vaulted ceiling to me and back again.

			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_100_r_2_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>Aware of the privilege of having the cave to
				<lb facs='#facs_100_r_2_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>myself, I felt like the center of the universe. My
				<lb facs='#facs_100_r_2_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>mouth was actually inhaling the cave, all of it,
				<lb facs='#facs_100_r_2_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>and breathing it out again. The cave contracted
				<lb facs='#facs_100_r_2_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>and expanded with my rhythms, and shimmered
				<lb facs='#facs_100_r_2_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>on its way back and forth. I made a pact with the
				<lb facs='#facs_100_r_2_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>cave: it would tell me some of its secrets in ex
				<lb facs='#facs_100_r_2_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>change for my rituals, rituals that it had not seen
				<lb facs='#facs_100_r_2_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>for millennia. I in turn would learn some secrets
				<lb facs='#facs_100_r_2_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>now and some later—l had only to listen, to keep
				<lb facs='#facs_100_r_2_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>in touch.
				<lb facs='#facs_100_r_2_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>The first stalagmite chamber to the front and
				<lb facs='#facs_100_r_2_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>left of the great hall provided a natural altar, as it
				<lb facs='#facs_100_r_2_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>was elevated a few feet above the floor and in
				<lb facs='#facs_100_r_2_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>clear view from any point in the hall. In the center
				<lb facs='#facs_100_r_2_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>of the altar stood a stalagmite the size of a large
				<lb facs='#facs_100_r_2_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>Mother Goddess. Full-figured, she endured, frozen
				<lb facs='#facs_100_r_2_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>through the ages but still in charge. In front of Her
				<lb facs='#facs_100_r_2_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>and facing the great hall was a sloping stalagmite
				<lb facs='#facs_100_r_2_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>the height of a table; behind Her, concealed from

				<lb facs='#facs_100_r_2_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>We poked around in the ground outside the

				<lb facs='#facs_100_r_2_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>have not been for a long time. On the way back
				<lb facs='#facs_100_r_2_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>down, we spent time in the deserted village
				<lb facs='#facs_100_r_2_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>abandoned, we guessed, for lack of water. But
				<lb facs='#facs_100_r_2_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>here again was magic; on a back path we found a
				<lb facs='#facs_100_r_2_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>pomegranate tree in full bloom. The vineyards
				<lb facs='#facs_100_r_2_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>originally cultivated by Humac villagers are still
				<lb facs='#facs_100_r_2_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>harvested for their grapes and the fields for their
				<lb facs='#facs_100_r_2_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>lavender, which was in bloom. The houses, made
				<lb facs='#facs_100_r_2_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>from fieldstones piled one on top of the other
				<lb facs='#facs_100_r_2_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>without mortar, grew as if molded from the earth.
				<lb facs='#facs_100_r_2_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>Everything was in harmony. We continued to
				<lb facs='#facs_100_r_2_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>come down with our physical bodies, but our
				<lb facs='#facs_100_r_2_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>spirits were still high up there.
				<lb facs='#facs_100_r_2_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>Note: After this day, and with encouragement from the
				<lb facs='#facs_100_r_2_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>natives of Hvar Island, we located Professor Novak. Again
				<lb facs='#facs_100_r_2_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>by word of mouth, we found his house in the town of
				<lb facs='#facs_100_r_2_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>Hvar. He graciously allowed us to visit his observatory,
				<lb facs='#facs_100_r_2_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>which he showed us with pride, and the visit ended with
				<lb facs='#facs_100_r_2_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>gifts of shards and shells from the cave. Among scores of
				<lb facs='#facs_100_r_2_1_tl_45' n='N045'/>artifacts, mostly bowls, removed from the cave or recon
				<lb facs='#facs_100_r_2_1_tl_46' n='N046'/>structed from shards, there were two chalices in Professor
				<lb facs='#facs_100_r_2_1_tl_47' n='N047'/>Novak's observatory that were of particular interest to me.
				<lb facs='#facs_100_r_2_1_tl_48' n='N048'/>Identically shaped, their form was so non-functional that
				<lb facs='#facs_100_r_2_1_tl_49' n='N049'/>they must have been used for ritual purposes. They ap

				<lb facs='#facs_100_r_2_1_tl_51' n='N051'/>tangible proof of an ancient secret. I struggled to get a
				<lb facs='#facs_100_r_2_1_tl_52' n='N052'/>photograph through the glass case. Chalices of this type
				<lb facs='#facs_100_r_2_1_tl_53' n='N053'/>are referred to by Cimbutas as wine cups with phallus
				<lb facs='#facs_100_r_2_1_tl_54' n='N054'/>stem bases, used when the Goddess of Vegetation was

				<lb facs='#facs_102_r_2_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>and it lands me inside my first memory. We'd gone to play
				<lb facs='#facs_102_r_2_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>behind my Grandmother's barn one evening, after a rain
				<lb facs='#facs_102_r_2_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>A memory of sky in the puddles as a new-made rainbow

				<lb facs='#facs_102_r_2_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>tempts me with to get me to trust Her, and I usually do.
				<lb facs='#facs_102_r_2_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>really have no other choice. She fashions things before
				<lb facs='#facs_102_r_2_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>me, waiting to be found.
				<lb facs='#facs_102_r_2_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>At this point, I’d like to report Her to the Patriarchy,
				<lb facs='#facs_102_r_2_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>but they wouldn't believe me. Besides, they'd probably
				<lb facs='#facs_102_r_2_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>try to get at Her through me. Burn me or something
				<lb facs='#facs_102_r_2_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>equally obscene. So I'll try to warn you, my sisters. The

				<lb facs='#facs_102_r_2_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>tracks in my mind. They make me want Her for comfort,
				<lb facs='#facs_102_r_2_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>and just lead me deeper. Deeper and clearer, in a soft
				<lb facs='#facs_102_r_2_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>light. But She stamps out the pattern with feet of cut
				<lb facs='#facs_102_r_2_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>glass. She makes Her tracks bloody with my own pain.

				<lb facs='#facs_102_r_2_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>prove it was premeditated. There are several strong pieces
				<lb facs='#facs_102_r_2_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>of evidence that point toward prior knowledge of a kind

				<lb facs='#facs_102_r_2_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>Carolyn died one summer evening. Another like me,

				<lb facs='#facs_102_r_2_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>think of death, and now this spun me 'round. I watched
				<lb facs='#facs_102_r_2_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>the dance her dying made, but couldn't find her there. To
				<lb facs='#facs_102_r_2_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>humor me, my collective said they'd bury me in the yard.
				<lb facs='#facs_102_r_2_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>How to come to terms with it? It crept into my conversa
				<lb facs='#facs_102_r_2_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>tion. I tend to think in themes and my friends saw this as
				<lb facs='#facs_102_r_2_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>the latest. When my mother's sister died I wasn't too
				<lb facs='#facs_102_r_2_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>surprised. Everyone I knew would die. The ending had
				<lb facs='#facs_102_r_2_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>begun. A rather inauspicious beginning. You can see

				<lb facs='#facs_102_r_2_1_tl_46' n='N046'/>Down by the river we watched the leaves fall. Saw the sun

				<lb facs='#facs_102_r_2_1_tl_48' n='N048'/>woods, admiring a dandelion dried in the sun. Turning to
				<lb facs='#facs_102_r_2_1_tl_49' n='N049'/>look up at I saw Death's face. Hold me, she said.
				<lb facs='#facs_102_r_2_1_tl_50' n='N050'/>And I did. Terror that laced us up in a web. She'd heard a
				<lb facs='#facs_102_r_2_1_tl_51' n='N051'/>car crash, and some woman scream. She was shaking and
				<lb facs='#facs_102_r_2_1_tl_52' n='N052'/>I never said how she'd scared me. We had to be one to

			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_102_r_3_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>survive. But Susan got hungry and I didn't feed her. When

				<lb facs='#facs_102_r_3_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>around. Say who I was and see what would happen.
				<lb facs='#facs_102_r_3_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>didn't have words, I told my collective, trying to explain
				<lb facs='#facs_102_r_3_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>the hunger I felt. We must share process and not just our
				<lb facs='#facs_102_r_3_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>answers. Let each other in and find our grounding here.

				<lb facs='#facs_102_r_3_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>freaked out, didn't know what I meant. All but Susan

				<lb facs='#facs_102_r_3_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>brought out the book.
				<lb facs='#facs_102_r_3_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>The Comforter, the story of what I really wanted. A
				<lb facs='#facs_102_r_3_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>horrible man murders his lover. Tries to escape in a car

				<lb facs='#facs_102_r_3_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>country—an island where the people are real. They all
				<lb facs='#facs_102_r_3_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>feed each other—and live by their dreams. They take him
				<lb facs='#facs_102_r_3_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>in and he learns how to heal.
				<lb facs='#facs_102_r_3_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>Out to the airport to see my mentor. The book beside
				<lb facs='#facs_102_r_3_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>me in the car. A butterfly net to see what would happen, a
				<lb facs='#facs_102_r_3_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>test that I gave her, to pass if she could. It felt safe to be
				<lb facs='#facs_102_r_3_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>with her—she made the land real. Once school was over,
				<lb facs='#facs_102_r_3_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>we'd work it together. But she sought to explore the
				<lb facs='#facs_102_r_3_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>depths of my mind and I saw her approaching with games
				<lb facs='#facs_102_r_3_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>that I knew. I gave her the book over dinner—and then
				<lb facs='#facs_102_r_3_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>left the airport. Never a word about what was at stake.
				<lb facs='#facs_102_r_3_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>knew in the giving that she wouldn't be there. I must
				<lb facs='#facs_102_r_3_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>make rules of my own

				<lb facs='#facs_102_r_3_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>right. No. No, it didn't—but my memory's that way. At
				<lb facs='#facs_102_r_3_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>the top of the hill, he must have seen her lights coming
				<lb facs='#facs_102_r_3_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>Pulled to the right and she hit me head-on.
				<lb facs='#facs_102_r_3_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>The driver in the car beside me died with his prophesy
				<lb facs='#facs_102_r_3_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>that I’d never live. Tangle of death spilled out on the
				<lb facs='#facs_102_r_3_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>highway. Her web filled with cuttings —blown in the
				<lb facs='#facs_102_r_3_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>wind. The rope that She threw me held many hands— all
				<lb facs='#facs_102_r_3_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>come to find our way home.

				<lb facs='#facs_102_r_4_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>Not the same. I had changed. She blotted all from view

			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_103_r_1_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>closer, all I could see was an eye. The world slipped under
				<lb facs='#facs_103_r_1_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>a microscope. In for close study, life at the root. I’d
				<lb facs='#facs_103_r_1_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>forgotten how to choose between sounds. Everything
				<lb facs='#facs_103_r_1_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>carried a life of its own. My left side blew in the wind, like
				<lb facs='#facs_103_r_1_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>a leaf close to dying. All I remember is its being born. The
				<lb facs='#facs_103_r_1_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>pain was so constant, it lost all its words. By the time
				<lb facs='#facs_103_r_1_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>remember, the first hurting was over, moving its way to
				<lb facs='#facs_103_r_1_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>outside my skin. But someone must hold me or I would
				<lb facs='#facs_103_r_1_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>fall. The path that I saw lay straight ahead. My neck didn't
				<lb facs='#facs_103_r_1_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>turn I couldn't see 'round. No matter. Everyone loved
				<lb facs='#facs_103_r_1_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>me. Persephone, once home, to go out no more
				<lb facs='#facs_103_r_1_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>The fact that I didn't feel winter was just a reflection of
				<lb facs='#facs_103_r_1_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>life's harmony. The world turned to crystal. To stay alive !
				<lb facs='#facs_103_r_1_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>must move in the direction I saw by tracing out patterns
				<lb facs='#facs_103_r_1_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>made by the feel. The Waterpeople took me home and
				<lb facs='#facs_103_r_1_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>one by one all burned out. Susan was first. She had held
				<lb facs='#facs_103_r_1_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>the flame of their loving. They gave me a home that was
				<lb facs='#facs_103_r_1_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>free for the living and she felt its foundation rest on her
				<lb facs='#facs_103_r_1_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>back. Felt she couldn't touch me or the rest of her would
				<lb facs='#facs_103_r_1_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>all drain away. Pain, shattered crystal, let me know I was

				<lb facs='#facs_103_r_1_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>distressed my friends and made them pull away. Every
				<lb facs='#facs_103_r_1_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>time they looked for progress, they saw me looking back.
				<lb facs='#facs_103_r_1_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>The hospital held such pain; I knew it to be the mouth
				<lb facs='#facs_103_r_1_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>of the trap. Packed with illusions and spewing out dam
				<lb facs='#facs_103_r_1_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>age, housing the doctor who worked on my head. I be
				<lb facs='#facs_103_r_1_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>lieved him when he said he knew nothing to heal me. Like
				<lb facs='#facs_103_r_1_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>a leaf in the wind, my touching was fragile. Live by
				<lb facs='#facs_103_r_1_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>death's door and I mustn't scream. Half of my brain lay
				<lb facs='#facs_103_r_1_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>crushed on the highway. Now was the time to attend a
				<lb facs='#facs_103_r_1_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>new birth. Going toward good feeling moved me out in
				<lb facs='#facs_103_r_1_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>new spaces, leaving my mother, joining my friends. Brand
				<lb facs='#facs_103_r_1_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>new child, filled with wonder, turning from death's
				<lb facs='#facs_103_r_1_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>invitation because something else called. If survival didn't
				<lb facs='#facs_103_r_1_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>feel good, that meant I would die. My left arm answered
				<lb facs='#facs_103_r_1_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>and swept through the air. I watched with the others as
				<lb facs='#facs_103_r_1_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>the energy made my arm dance. Everyone had an opinion
				<lb facs='#facs_103_r_1_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>— as if down in the cellar I’d found a strange bird. It
				<lb facs='#facs_103_r_1_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>danced to the left, just where I wasn't watching. There
				<lb facs='#facs_103_r_1_1_tl_45' n='N045'/>was a crack to the left where things would fall out. A
				<lb facs='#facs_103_r_1_1_tl_46' n='N046'/>place of surprises, a hole in the world. My arm moved
				<lb facs='#facs_103_r_1_1_tl_47' n='N047'/>through space only others could see. Enough to feel its
				<lb facs='#facs_103_r_1_1_tl_48' n='N048'/>lovely motion weaving round the crack. Left arm sews the
				<lb facs='#facs_103_r_1_1_tl_49' n='N049'/>world together when I let it dance.
				<lb facs='#facs_103_r_1_1_tl_50' n='N050'/>To be able to feel it, there was one cardinal rule. Lying
				<lb facs='#facs_103_r_1_1_tl_51' n='N051'/>was out. It made two things out of one. I could only see,
				<lb facs='#facs_103_r_1_1_tl_52' n='N052'/>hear, think one thing at a time. Lies confused me, they
				<lb facs='#facs_103_r_1_1_tl_53' n='N053'/>tasted of death. But not to lie meant I must say it out
				<lb facs='#facs_103_r_1_1_tl_54' n='N054'/>loud. Any idea that started to harden, I would set free for
				<lb facs='#facs_103_r_1_1_tl_55' n='N055'/>the sake of space in my mind. Each moment carried its
				<lb facs='#facs_103_r_1_1_tl_56' n='N056'/>own comfort— all I had to do was attend. Throw out the
				<lb facs='#facs_103_r_1_1_tl_57' n='N057'/>rocks I found in my bedding and trust to the softness my
				<lb facs='#facs_103_r_1_1_tl_58' n='N058'/>dancing arm made —light forming spirals just off to the
				<lb facs='#facs_103_r_1_1_tl_59' n='N059'/>Out of time, yesterday had left me here. Constant
				<lb facs='#facs_103_r_1_1_tl_60' n='N060'/>inner tremble so I couldn't walk. Learn the speed of an
				<lb facs='#facs_103_r_1_1_tl_61' n='N061'/>infant's run when life's an endless day. So trusting con
				<lb facs='#facs_103_r_1_1_tl_62' n='N062'/>fection, I danced with my friends. A moon to the orbits
				<lb facs='#facs_103_r_1_1_tl_63' n='N063'/>saw their lives make. They talked to me from some other
				<lb facs='#facs_103_r_1_1_tl_64' n='N064'/>planet. They'd come play for a while and then they would
				<lb facs='#facs_103_r_1_1_tl_65' n='N065'/>leave — to worlds more important than passing the
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_103_r_2_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>moments. Cursed now to live on the edge of their lives.
				<lb facs='#facs_103_r_2_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>Strangers I met seemed cut loose from fairy tales — come
				<lb facs='#facs_103_r_2_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>to show me the space I was in.
				<lb facs='#facs_103_r_2_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>
				<lb facs='#facs_103_r_2_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>
				<lb facs='#facs_103_r_2_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>
				<lb facs='#facs_103_r_2_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>
				<lb facs='#facs_103_r_2_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>Events seemed to happen in some kind of order, laying
				<lb facs='#facs_103_r_2_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>a trail to find my way home. First New York to visit a
				<lb facs='#facs_103_r_2_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>friend in the making. I met Diana before I was hurt and
				<lb facs='#facs_103_r_2_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>we'd talked much of death. This visit to her was a part of
				<lb facs='#facs_103_r_2_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>the pattern. A point on the Continuum, next thread in the
				<lb facs='#facs_103_r_2_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>weaving. Almost a stranger—she took on that dimension
				<lb facs='#facs_103_r_2_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>the moment she suggested I color my hair.
				<lb facs='#facs_103_r_2_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>Henna. It was a strange bottle I found on her shelf.
				<lb facs='#facs_103_r_2_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>Egyptian mud, good for the head. We both got excited at
				<lb facs='#facs_103_r_2_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>the thought of it red. But back in St. Louis, it was just
				<lb facs='#facs_103_r_2_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>another sign of my strangeness.
				<lb facs='#facs_103_r_2_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>With my red hair I went off to a conference on Radical
				<lb facs='#facs_103_r_2_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>Therapy. Friends were driving, but I flew ahead. Exhilarate
				<lb facs='#facs_103_r_2_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>ing to be on my own, to have no one meet me to act as a
				<lb facs='#facs_103_r_2_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>shield. Strangers there would not know about damage.
				<lb facs='#facs_103_r_2_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>Thoughts of finding someone like me
				<lb facs='#facs_103_r_2_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>At the Grand Hotel in Iowa City, I followed the instruc
				<lb facs='#facs_103_r_2_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>tions of the brochure. It said we'd be picked up at eight
				<lb facs='#facs_103_r_2_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>o'clock. Color and balance came in with the roses. They
				<lb facs='#facs_103_r_2_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>made three hours waiting seem one long rich moment.
				<lb facs='#facs_103_r_2_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>Just before eight, hunger sent me to the dining room for a
				<lb facs='#facs_103_r_2_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>"sandwich to go." A woman in the room stood up and
				<lb facs='#facs_103_r_2_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>waved. After checking out she meant me, I walked over
				<lb facs='#facs_103_r_2_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>and she asked me to sit down. A mysterious stranger—the
				<lb facs='#facs_103_r_2_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>feel of the Goddess, come in disguise. I felt a magical pull
				<lb facs='#facs_103_r_2_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>and then thought—mistake. She was such a drag and kept
				<lb facs='#facs_103_r_2_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>calling me "kid." Just another pigeon with the message
				<lb facs='#facs_103_r_2_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>—go home. She asked my direction and found I didn't
				<lb facs='#facs_103_r_2_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>know it. Said that those radicals would eat off my head.
				<lb facs='#facs_103_r_2_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>Don't go, please to stay with her for the night. Go back in
				<lb facs='#facs_103_r_2_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>the morning to all those who loved me—and learn to have
				<lb facs='#facs_103_r_2_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>caution before the next flight.
				<lb facs='#facs_103_r_2_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>really regretted my impulse to join her. I left her at
				<lb facs='#facs_103_r_2_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>table and went to the lobby to find the right ride. But the
				<lb facs='#facs_103_r_2_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>lady came up and pulled on my sleeve. Don’t do it, kid.
				<lb facs='#facs_103_r_2_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>Her mouth was tight. Something will happen, I just feel
				<lb facs='#facs_103_r_2_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>like I know. This was the time to pull my trump card
				<lb facs='#facs_103_r_2_1_tl_45' n='N045'/>wanting to take the words from her mouth. A few months
				<lb facs='#facs_103_r_2_1_tl_46' n='N046'/>ago, I almost died, I said. I want to keep living until
				<lb facs='#facs_103_r_2_1_tl_47' n='N047'/>there's no choice. I know about death, she said, holding
				<lb facs='#facs_103_r_2_1_tl_48' n='N048'/>up a two fingered hand. I have a strange disease you've
				<lb facs='#facs_103_r_2_1_tl_49' n='N049'/>never heard of. My whole body is turning to stone. The air
				<lb facs='#facs_103_r_2_1_tl_50' n='N050'/>in the room hushed for a moment. Still as a window to
				<lb facs='#facs_103_r_2_1_tl_51' n='N051'/>some other world. Contact with Stonelady had shown me
				<lb facs='#facs_103_r_2_1_tl_52' n='N052'/>the stakes of my choices. Went off to the conference with
				<lb facs='#facs_103_r_2_1_tl_53' n='N053'/>no need for roots. Passing up drama, I went to the kitchen
				<lb facs='#facs_103_r_2_1_tl_54' n='N054'/>and found chopping onions a most profound act. Life is so
				<lb facs='#facs_103_r_2_1_tl_55' n='N055'/>easy among your own kind.
				<lb facs='#facs_103_r_2_1_tl_56' n='N056'/>So many ways to heal. Into the season of acts of faith,
				<lb facs='#facs_103_r_2_1_tl_57' n='N057'/>I started my own practice again. Thought to take up
				<lb facs='#facs_103_r_2_1_tl_58' n='N058'/>where I had left off. Annie was shocked when she saw my
				<lb facs='#facs_103_r_2_1_tl_59' n='N059'/>red hair—she remembered a dream full of fear. While
				<lb facs='#facs_103_r_2_1_tl_60' n='N060'/>lay in a coma, she dreamed of a visit. Down to the hos
				<lb facs='#facs_103_r_2_1_tl_61' n='N061'/>pital, a big, empty room—a screen with a picture of me.
				<lb facs='#facs_103_r_2_1_tl_62' n='N062'/>had bright red hair.
				<lb facs='#facs_103_r_2_1_tl_63' n='N063'/>Helping to heal, we talked on new levels. She made me
				<lb facs='#facs_103_r_2_1_tl_64' n='N064'/>be honest with all that I knew. Annie spoke of her friend
				<lb facs='#facs_103_r_2_1_tl_65' n='N065'/>who was dying of cancer—same side of the brain. Annie
				<lb facs='#facs_103_r_2_1_tl_66' n='N066'/>carried our stories until he asked that we meet. It felt like
				<lb facs='#facs_103_r_2_1_tl_67' n='N067'/>a summons, contrary to choice. I feel like I've known you
				<lb facs='#facs_103_r_2_1_tl_68' n='N068'/>for all of my life, Tom said softly, just after we'd come. I
			</p>
			<pb n='104'/>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_104_r_1_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>could only stand and nod but we both felt the pull.
				<lb facs='#facs_104_r_1_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>Another who knows the left side dying. Said that some
				<lb facs='#facs_104_r_1_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>day I’d come back for a visit. That night, I knew it was
				<lb facs='#facs_104_r_1_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>time.
				<lb facs='#facs_104_r_1_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>But I had no last name or room number and Annie's
				<lb facs='#facs_104_r_1_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>line was still busy. When I reached her she told me, he
				<lb facs='#facs_104_r_1_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>was leaving the next day. His parents were taking him
				<lb facs='#facs_104_r_1_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>home to die. We went back to the hospital next morning
				<lb facs='#facs_104_r_1_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>at dawn, pulled by a power, a trust beyond reason. Where
				<lb facs='#facs_104_r_1_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>were you, asked Tom. Last night was so awful. They’re all
				<lb facs='#facs_104_r_1_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>crazy animals. I wanted you to come and you didn't. I
				<lb facs='#facs_104_r_1_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>couldn't get here by myself but I heard you call. We
				<lb facs='#facs_104_r_1_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>shared his breakfast for feelings that gave us. All know
				<lb facs='#facs_104_r_1_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>ing the pleasure of taking what's good. It's so important to
				<lb facs='#facs_104_r_1_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>see all the leaving. Don't let them hide the knowing from
				<lb facs='#facs_104_r_1_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>you. To see clearly you'll have to look through your pain.
				<lb facs='#facs_104_r_1_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>It gets so beautiful when you admit what is real. To die is
				<lb facs='#facs_104_r_1_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>no sadder than anything else. When I stood to leave,
				<lb facs='#facs_104_r_1_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>knew we had met. Instead of goodbye he gave me his hat
				<lb facs='#facs_104_r_1_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>A bright orange knit hat had covered his shaven head
				<lb facs='#facs_104_r_1_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>The feel of a helmet, protection—like in henna's jar. As
				<lb facs='#facs_104_r_1_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>long as I wore it, my head would be safe. Events kept
				<lb facs='#facs_104_r_1_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>stringing together. Someone had thought my hair should
				<lb facs='#facs_104_r_1_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>be red. A current of thought, a force that was larger. Who
				<lb facs='#facs_104_r_1_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>do you think was messing around with my head? Witches
				<lb facs='#facs_104_r_1_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>are known for their red hair all over the world. It tied in
				<lb facs='#facs_104_r_1_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>with legends of strangers who came from distant lands,
				<lb facs='#facs_104_r_1_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>strangers with red hair and blue eyes. There, you see
				<lb facs='#facs_104_r_1_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>She's at it again. It's no wonder I thought my life had been
				<lb facs='#facs_104_r_1_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>blessed.
				<lb facs='#facs_104_r_1_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>Tom sent me a painting. That was important. The
				<lb facs='#facs_104_r_1_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>painting was framed in the way of my looking. It hung on
				<lb facs='#facs_104_r_1_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>the wall for when I could see. Taking a glance I first felt
				<lb facs='#facs_104_r_1_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>afraid. Somehow, word of my magic hadn't moved to the
				<lb facs='#facs_104_r_1_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>Waterhouse. Susan, at center, was spinning me 'round.
				<lb facs='#facs_104_r_1_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>All I really wanted was for Susan to love me. The fact that
				<lb facs='#facs_104_r_1_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>she didn't became a new koan. I couldn't help wanting
				<lb facs='#facs_104_r_1_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>her and knew that the wanting was what kept me out. But
				<lb facs='#facs_104_r_1_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>wanting was feeling, an energy flow. I had to want Susan
				<lb facs='#facs_104_r_1_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>to make my arm dance. New breakthroughs: breaking so
				<lb facs='#facs_104_r_1_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>much I walked on cut glass. I wanted to leave, according
				<lb facs='#facs_104_r_1_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>to schedule. Afraid, if I didn't, I never would. Easy enough
				<lb facs='#facs_104_r_1_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>to go back to school; a crippled whiz-kid who's excused
				<lb facs='#facs_104_r_1_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>half her brain. Clear, to stay here, there's no happy
				<lb facs='#facs_104_r_1_1_tl_45' n='N045'/>ending. Go in the direction of my dancing arm.
				<lb facs='#facs_104_r_1_1_tl_46' n='N046'/>On the agenda of dreams made to order, a plan was
				<lb facs='#facs_104_r_1_1_tl_47' n='N047'/>still held by my mentor. Beautiful lady in worlds full of
				<lb facs='#facs_104_r_1_1_tl_48' n='N048'/>color. I loved how she sailed such sights from my soul
				<lb facs='#facs_104_r_1_1_tl_49' n='N049'/>Knowing she loved me, showed I was good. If I could join
				<lb facs='#facs_104_r_1_1_tl_50' n='N050'/>her, then I wasn't broken. Healers together, keeping alive.
				<lb facs='#facs_104_r_1_1_tl_51' n='N051'/>She'd been the Waterpeople's credentials. She'd battled
				<lb facs='#facs_104_r_1_1_tl_52' n='N052'/>my mother and she had won. Guiding me always through
				<lb facs='#facs_104_r_1_1_tl_53' n='N053'/>a war of decisions, she seemed to know the rules of the
				<lb facs='#facs_104_r_1_1_tl_54' n='N054'/>game. But our lives had gotten twisted around the event.
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_104_r_2_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>Summer and Mentor packed me off to Milwaukee
				<lb facs='#facs_104_r_2_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>Lived by the lake in a castle-like house; her lover lived
				<lb facs='#facs_104_r_2_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>with us and she was the star. I was to build my world onto
				<lb facs='#facs_104_r_2_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>hers. Take up her practice where she left off. They'd fly
				<lb facs='#facs_104_r_2_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>away and return for reflection, the heat of their living
				<lb facs='#facs_104_r_2_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>made my only light. With summer's passing, my mind
				<lb facs='#facs_104_r_2_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>turned to crystal. I thought I must freeze not to loose
				<lb facs='#facs_104_r_2_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>what I knew. No ground for my being kept me an object
				<lb facs='#facs_104_r_2_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>on foreign soil. Left arm hanging down like a clipped
				<lb facs='#facs_104_r_2_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>wing. I left the damn city, the first day of Fall. Take what!
				<lb facs='#facs_104_r_2_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>knew and trust it to heal me. No way to make the next
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_104_r_3_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>moment safe. I soared with the feeling of flinging off 
				<lb facs='#facs_104_r_3_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>rules.
				<lb facs='#facs_104_r_3_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>Get up, out of the middle I heard a voice call. Stuck in
				<lb facs='#facs_104_r_3_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>the middle, since I could remember. A family, this state,
				<lb facs='#facs_104_r_3_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>this century. Get by with no boundaries. That's how to
				<lb facs='#facs_104_r_3_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>survive. Feelings. Magnets to sources whose endings were
				<lb facs='#facs_104_r_3_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>dead. Be a Good Catholic Girl, or politico or shrink.
				<lb facs='#facs_104_r_3_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>Change the answers to questions and follow the flow. The
				<lb facs='#facs_104_r_3_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>only room I felt led out on the highway, drive to New
				<lb facs='#facs_104_r_3_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>York, no need for a map. Stay in the present or the crack
				<lb facs='#facs_104_r_3_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>would come open. Things falling out where I couldn't see.
				<lb facs='#facs_104_r_3_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>New York appeared a platform of safety—fly towards
				<lb facs='#facs_104_r_3_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>outside and land on my feet. New. York was the world!
				<lb facs='#facs_104_r_3_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>left, inside out. Here to begin, I’d come to the landing. It
				<lb facs='#facs_104_r_3_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>seemed everyone here had just left the boat.
				<lb facs='#facs_104_r_3_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>But back to St. Louis, prodigal child. A trial was
				<lb facs='#facs_104_r_3_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>scheduled—on the subject of brain damage. No question
				<lb facs='#facs_104_r_3_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>of fault —the woman had been on the wrong side of the
				<lb facs='#facs_104_r_3_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>road. All that was left was to determine the extent of the
				<lb facs='#facs_104_r_3_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>damage. Damage or magic? That was my question. The
				<lb facs='#facs_104_r_3_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>roads of this journey, the truth would unfold. The Past
				<lb facs='#facs_104_r_3_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>would provide the vision so that I could see who I was.
				<lb facs='#facs_104_r_3_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>Mythmaker, living a part of the tale. Go back to the trial
				<lb facs='#facs_104_r_3_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>—then travel the country—follow a spiral knotted with
				<lb facs='#facs_104_r_3_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>dreams. Travel the distance to an old point of view, back
				<lb facs='#facs_104_r_3_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>to Grandmother who lay in bed dying. Join all the women
				<lb facs='#facs_104_r_3_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>— over my mother's head. Whisper to the old women, her
				<lb facs='#facs_104_r_3_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>mother's name. Make me a name to roll off the tongue.
				<lb facs='#facs_104_r_3_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>Mary Martha McGuire, say who I am.
				<lb facs='#facs_104_r_3_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>Riding in Goldie, I’d skim the earth, picking up point
				<lb facs='#facs_104_r_3_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>ers from friends where they lay. Connections I’d made I’d
				<lb facs='#facs_104_r_3_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>paint on a mural. One rose in the sun, glitter paint for the
				<lb facs='#facs_104_r_3_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>water, moon on the left. Maybe a bird on the back of the
				<lb facs='#facs_104_r_3_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>van, to show that a nest could fly. Filled with junk from
				<lb facs='#facs_104_r_3_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>all the unmoving, Goldie began this like a good scout. She
				<lb facs='#facs_104_r_3_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>carried an old chair of my mother's, dancing with clutter.
				<lb facs='#facs_104_r_3_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>I said hold me and show me the vision I need.
				<lb facs='#facs_104_r_3_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>Return to St. Louis but instead of answers — all ques
				<lb facs='#facs_104_r_3_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>tions. All looking at me. Leaders of living had all gone
				<lb facs='#facs_104_r_3_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>away. No one to judge the stand that I took, no one to
				<lb facs='#facs_104_r_3_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>help me decide. My arm danced for the lawyer when
				<lb facs='#facs_104_r_3_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>told him the truth. My trial was over, with my questions
				<lb facs='#facs_104_r_3_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>for answers. Come to find out the planet is me.
				<lb facs='#facs_104_r_3_1_tl_45' n='N045'/>In Goldie there was Pat in Florida, Pat in Mexico, Pat
				<lb facs='#facs_104_r_3_1_tl_46' n='N046'/>who was the lover of the woman who had given The
				<lb facs='#facs_104_r_3_1_tl_47' n='N047'/>Comforter to Susan. Pat with me in Texas, where I went to
				<lb facs='#facs_104_r_3_1_tl_48' n='N048'/>see my sister. The threads of the pattern still weaving.
				<lb facs='#facs_104_r_3_1_tl_49' n='N049'/>A member of family at Christmas, work the way back
				<lb facs='#facs_104_r_3_1_tl_50' n='N050'/>in. This was to be the introduction of magic, the next
				<lb facs='#facs_104_r_3_1_tl_51' n='N051'/>logical step towards going home. My sister was kind and
				<lb facs='#facs_104_r_3_1_tl_52' n='N052'/>then angry at damage. When my parents wouldn't talk to
				<lb facs='#facs_104_r_3_1_tl_53' n='N053'/>me on Christmas, I saw what she meant. I couldn't move
				<lb facs='#facs_104_r_3_1_tl_54' n='N054'/>backward and so I leaned forward. Out to find Pat to
				<lb facs='#facs_104_r_3_1_tl_55' n='N055'/>spend The New Year
				<lb facs='#facs_104_r_3_1_tl_56' n='N056'/>A woman was with her, when I arrived at the house.
				<lb facs='#facs_104_r_3_1_tl_57' n='N057'/>Mary, someone I’d already met. Then, she had told me I
				<lb facs='#facs_104_r_3_1_tl_58' n='N058'/>gave her the creeps. She thought I could see through her.
				<lb facs='#facs_104_r_3_1_tl_59' n='N059'/>As for me, that was fine. Sore from the cutting I felt from
				<lb facs='#facs_104_r_3_1_tl_60' n='N060'/>my family, trying to tie my egg to a knot. They wanted to
				<lb facs='#facs_104_r_3_1_tl_61' n='N061'/>trip and I decided to do it. Have someone with me, feeling
				<lb facs='#facs_104_r_3_1_tl_62' n='N062'/>of home. Went to a house in the country, where Pat knew
				<lb facs='#facs_104_r_3_1_tl_63' n='N063'/>two women. Down by the river better to follow the light
				<lb facs='#facs_104_r_3_1_tl_64' n='N064'/>of the day. Mary moved among trees, me trailing after.
				<lb facs='#facs_104_r_3_1_tl_65' n='N065'/>With me, she felt a pain of her own. Each time I got
				<lb facs='#facs_104_r_3_1_tl_66' n='N066'/>settled, she told me to move. She seemed to enjoy the
				<lb facs='#facs_104_r_3_1_tl_67' n='N067'/>role that I gave her. Asking for safety and then I was
				<lb facs='#facs_104_r_3_1_tl_68' n='N068'/>hounded. Heard her footsteps and took to the woods.

			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_105_r_1_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>One step at a time, the rhythm was walking. Feet
				<lb facs='#facs_105_r_1_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>stroking earth's breast in a dream. Follow the path of my
				<lb facs='#facs_105_r_1_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>dancing arm. Tripping my brains out, brain-damaged
				<lb facs='#facs_105_r_1_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>pervert, loose in the woods. Lost in west Texas, I walked
				<lb facs='#facs_105_r_1_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>foreign country. Night started falling and the monster was
				<lb facs='#facs_105_r_1_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>me. Too strange for Christmas, good Catholic girl, matted
				<lb facs='#facs_105_r_1_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>to Mother's nightmare. She slept while she dreamed that!
				<lb facs='#facs_105_r_1_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>walked it alone. House on the hill had just turned its lights
				<lb facs='#facs_105_r_1_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>on, thought when ! saw it I’d found the way back. Stuck in
				<lb facs='#facs_105_r_1_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>fairy tales, I’d lost direction. From this point, home could
				<lb facs='#facs_105_r_1_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>be anywhere.
				<lb facs='#facs_105_r_1_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>Night had crept in, all the way to the fence. Go to the
				<lb facs='#facs_105_r_1_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>house, they’ll find out you're crazy. Strap a machine on
				<lb facs='#facs_105_r_1_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>you and then you'll survive. Approaching the door like a
				<lb facs='#facs_105_r_1_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>penitent sinner. Beaten down cur, held at bay by a dog. A
				<lb facs='#facs_105_r_1_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>boy turned to woman came out with her friend. She asked
				<lb facs='#facs_105_r_1_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>me again where I wanted to go. But my mouth couldn't
				<lb facs='#facs_105_r_1_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>hold the sounds it should make. Pat's name for a handle,
				<lb facs='#facs_105_r_1_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>out with a stammer. I breathed when she grabbed it, she
				<lb facs='#facs_105_r_1_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>knew I belonged. Other house in the country—for women
				<lb facs='#facs_105_r_1_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>out flying. Come into the kitchen and wait for your
				<lb facs='#facs_105_r_1_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>friends. Pat laughed when she saw me curled up in a
				<lb facs='#facs_105_r_1_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>chair. Argument ended, the world could be trusted
				<lb facs='#facs_105_r_1_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>starting with self. But I remembered trees cutting black
				<lb facs='#facs_105_r_1_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>ness—showing me depths waiting below.
				<lb facs='#facs_105_r_1_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>Before leaving Texas, I made a last visit. Passed
				<lb facs='#facs_105_r_1_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>mother's chair onto my sister; seat that had told me all
				<lb facs='#facs_105_r_1_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>that it could. Grandmother lay dying, surrounded by
				<lb facs='#facs_105_r_1_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>guards. I left Texas crying deep in my soul. Driving into
				<lb facs='#facs_105_r_1_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>New York I was doubly careful. Try not to fall off either
				<lb facs='#facs_105_r_1_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>side. Tired standing on the brim, but I mustn't wander
				<lb facs='#facs_105_r_1_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>Night's edges are sharp. No one to blame but yourself if
				<lb facs='#facs_105_r_1_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>you fall. Learn how to be here, out, up, on the ledge.
				<lb facs='#facs_105_r_1_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>One semester of grad school and I’d have credentials.
				<lb facs='#facs_105_r_1_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>Keep rhythm going through system of brakes. Prove
				<lb facs='#facs_105_r_1_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>could do it—this ledge is by choice. People began to look
				<lb facs='#facs_105_r_1_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>at me strangely, always, it seemed, I’d dropped from the
				<lb facs='#facs_105_r_1_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>sky. I asked their location and they thought I was lost. Bag
				<lb facs='#facs_105_r_1_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>ladies were comrades in this fading light. So mother was
				<lb facs='#facs_105_r_1_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>right after all —being alive is too much to ask
				<lb facs='#facs_105_r_1_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>On a trip to the ocean, I saw it all clearly. When the
				<lb facs='#facs_105_r_1_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>sun lay gray on the water, I knew for a fact. The world
				<lb facs='#facs_105_r_1_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>hadn't changed and the pain was in me. A case of terminal
				<lb facs='#facs_105_r_1_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>blindness—unless help arrived. Pity. Feel for the first time
				<lb facs='#facs_105_r_1_1_tl_45' n='N045'/>this body's sorrow. Hurting so long, not making a sound.
				<lb facs='#facs_105_r_1_1_tl_46' n='N046'/>Take it for granted—left has more feeling. Right clenching
				<lb facs='#facs_105_r_1_1_tl_47' n='N047'/>teeth, old broken jaw. Each cell in my body held in a
				<lb facs='#facs_105_r_1_1_tl_48' n='N048'/>scream. Make another world for me out of what's left.
				<lb facs='#facs_105_r_1_1_tl_49' n='N049'/>got something I could touch and see and carry home,
				<lb facs='#facs_105_r_1_1_tl_50' n='N050'/>covered in brown paper.
				<lb facs='#facs_105_r_1_1_tl_51' n='N051'/>You can only see bubbles looking down.
				<lb facs='#facs_105_r_1_1_tl_52' n='N052'/>BURSTING—take a drink.
				<lb facs='#facs_105_r_1_1_tl_53' n='N053'/>Buy a machine. At first, the left side of my body had felt
				<lb facs='#facs_105_r_1_1_tl_54' n='N054'/>like a balloon. Feeling came back like a mouth out of
				<lb facs='#facs_105_r_1_1_tl_55' n='N055'/>novocaine. Like hair that's electric, after the brush
				<lb facs='#facs_105_r_1_1_tl_56' n='N056'/>My vibrator's bright orange, same as the hat. Before,
				<lb facs='#facs_105_r_1_1_tl_57' n='N057'/>orgasms had only happened by accident. First lady lover
				<lb facs='#facs_105_r_1_1_tl_58' n='N058'/>had brought them to me. I squirted with laughter, to find
				<lb facs='#facs_105_r_1_1_tl_59' n='N059'/>such release. Liquid feeling, I could hardly stand. Frozen
				<lb facs='#facs_105_r_1_1_tl_60' n='N060'/>rod-like again, afraid of shattered glass. Seduce battered
				<lb facs='#facs_105_r_1_1_tl_61' n='N061'/>body, down to the feet.
				<lb facs='#facs_105_r_1_1_tl_62' n='N062'/>Inside had to see what outside was doing. Strange to
				<lb facs='#facs_105_r_1_1_tl_63' n='N063'/>be meeting now. Before the accident I’d found comfort
				<lb facs='#facs_105_r_1_1_tl_64' n='N064'/>looking—gazing into the mirror till I liked myself. A
				<lb facs='#facs_105_r_1_1_tl_65' n='N065'/>method of greeting, across foreign lands. To go further,
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_105_r_2_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>needed some outside validation. Odds were just fair,
				<lb facs='#facs_105_r_2_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>being broken, this would bring me to heal. Diana men
				<lb facs='#facs_105_r_2_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>tioned an article she'd read. The true myth of Narcissus,
				<lb facs='#facs_105_r_2_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>knew that was me. Ovid wrote the myth in Metamorphosis
				<lb facs='#facs_105_r_2_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>— an old story, since distorted by the insurgents. But the
				<lb facs='#facs_105_r_2_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>real myth has a different feel to it—about self-knowledge,
				<lb facs='#facs_105_r_2_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>not self-love. Tiresias prophesied that Narcissus would
				<lb facs='#facs_105_r_2_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>live to a ripe old age provided he never"knew" himself,
				<lb facs='#facs_105_r_2_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>not if he never "loved" himself. Narcissus went to the
				<lb facs='#facs_105_r_2_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>pool to quench a deep thirst. He looked into the water
				<lb facs='#facs_105_r_2_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>and heard something melt with the knowing. The image is
				<lb facs='#facs_105_r_2_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>The story's about the process of change. All transfor
				<lb facs='#facs_105_r_2_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>mations first feel like death. Death of who you once were
				<lb facs='#facs_105_r_2_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>is included in the price. Becoming more than you now
				<lb facs='#facs_105_r_2_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>are, knowing more than you now know, follows like a
				<lb facs='#facs_105_r_2_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>flower, just as Narcissus bloomed at the edge of the pool.
				<lb facs='#facs_105_r_2_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>To get this in motion, you need only look.
				<lb facs='#facs_105_r_2_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>Enough to send me out on a brazen new experiment.
				<lb facs='#facs_105_r_2_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>Down in the dark to face the poor monster I’d left in the
				<lb facs='#facs_105_r_2_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>woods. Orgasm felt like energy rattling pieces of me in the
				<lb facs='#facs_105_r_2_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>night. Brain-damaged cripple, I needed a watcher. Some
				<lb facs='#facs_105_r_2_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>one to tell me if I haven't come up. I went back into
				<lb facs='#facs_105_r_2_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>therapy and rented her eyes.
				<lb facs='#facs_105_r_2_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>The material world is holy I had to plug it up. My
				<lb facs='#facs_105_r_2_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>mantra was moldy from three years hard using. Time to
				<lb facs='#facs_105_r_2_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>replace it with many mirrors. Looking in mirrors, left
				<lb facs='#facs_105_r_2_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>found the right, long awaited reunion. Hands crossing
				<lb facs='#facs_105_r_2_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>over to match up the feelings. Each hand was holding
				<lb facs='#facs_105_r_2_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>what the other side knew. Tom's painting cleared to an
				<lb facs='#facs_105_r_2_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>EYE. I couldn't remember what had frightened me
				<lb facs='#facs_105_r_2_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>My therapist said at meeting that she was surprised at
				<lb facs='#facs_105_r_2_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>my chronological age. Color and light had gone out of my
				<lb facs='#facs_105_r_2_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>world. It showed on my face I had tasted defeat. Pain
				<lb facs='#facs_105_r_2_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>turned to anger and on its way out let me know I’d been
				<lb facs='#facs_105_r_2_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>screwed. All of the pieces were flying together. Coming so
				<lb facs='#facs_105_r_2_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>fast, they made my eyes spin. I went in from the ledge:
				<lb facs='#facs_105_r_2_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>down, up, dn 'umop
				<lb facs='#facs_105_r_2_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>towards compassion for self.
				<lb facs='#facs_105_r_2_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>Being my body made me replaceable. Just cells inter
				<lb facs='#facs_105_r_2_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>acting. There must be common channels, if I could only
				<lb facs='#facs_105_r_2_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>find where to tune. Moon of the Mother, look for fine
				<lb facs='#facs_105_r_2_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>sources; find the reflection and see your own face.
				<lb facs='#facs_105_r_2_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>Now, think over what I’m saying. There may be a way
				<lb facs='#facs_105_r_2_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>to help us get back. The medicine is dangerous, in which
				<lb facs='#facs_105_r_2_1_tl_45' n='N045'/>lies its power. Stand before a mirror. Just keep eye contact
				<lb facs='#facs_105_r_2_1_tl_46' n='N046'/>until you've said hello. Rest on the stream of feeling
				<lb facs='#facs_105_r_2_1_tl_47' n='N047'/>flowing through your eyes. Know the safety of that place
				<lb facs='#facs_105_r_2_1_tl_48' n='N048'/>where you ARE all change. Cry in your face—hurting

				<lb facs='#facs_108_r_4_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>The tribal societies of rainy West Africa still maintain
				<lb facs='#facs_108_r_4_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>traditions developed over years of experience in a harsh
				<lb facs='#facs_108_r_4_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>environment. The secret societies of these cultures are
				<lb facs='#facs_108_r_4_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>responsible for teaching social values and celebrating the
				<lb facs='#facs_108_r_4_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>rites of passage. In effect, they are the perpetuators of
				<lb facs='#facs_108_r_4_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>traditional codes. Among the Mende, Vai, Temne and
				<lb facs='#facs_108_r_4_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>Sherbro tribes of Sierra Leone and Liberia, there are two
				<lb facs='#facs_108_r_4_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>important secret societies: the Poro for men and the
				<lb facs='#facs_108_r_4_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>Bundu for women.
				<lb facs='#facs_108_r_4_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>It was through their art that I first learned about the
				<lb facs='#facs_108_r_4_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>secret order of the Bundu women. Their masks intrigued
				<lb facs='#facs_108_r_4_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>me. What does a masking tradition mean in terms of the
				<lb facs='#facs_108_r_4_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>lives of the women in this tribal society? How do they
				<lb facs='#facs_108_r_4_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>establish sexual identities and define the status of women
				<lb facs='#facs_108_r_4_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>in short, how do they perpetuate a stable social order?
				<lb facs='#facs_108_r_4_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>The Bundu is the only masked secret society of women
				<lb facs='#facs_108_r_4_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>in all of Africa. It functions within what appears to be a
				<lb facs='#facs_108_r_4_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>male-oriented culture concurrent with the Poro to main
				<lb facs='#facs_108_r_4_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>tain a balanced social order. Through the mask, Bundu
				<lb facs='#facs_108_r_4_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>women obtain power beyond that granted for merely
				<lb facs='#facs_108_r_4_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>domestic functions. They may hold public office, even
				<lb facs='#facs_108_r_4_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>that of Paramount Chief, and they are influential in gov
				<lb facs='#facs_108_r_4_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>ernment and business decisions. Their presence and their

				<lb facs='#facs_108_r_6_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>bers of the Poro. This knowledge enables them to function

				<lb facs='#facs_108_r_6_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>cestors is vital. They are the intermediaries between the

				<lb facs='#facs_108_r_6_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>chooses. However, initiation rites of female adolescents
				<lb facs='#facs_108_r_6_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>usually occur at the beginning of menstruation or preg
				<lb facs='#facs_108_r_6_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>nancy, at which time the initiates are taught by those who
				<lb facs='#facs_108_r_6_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>are informed or experienced.? Moreover, the extended
				<lb facs='#facs_108_r_6_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>Bundu training engenders both independence and a
				<lb facs='#facs_108_r_6_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>strong sense of sisterhood by permitting girls to loosen
				<lb facs='#facs_108_r_6_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>ties with their mothers at the same time that they make
				<lb facs='#facs_108_r_6_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>new ties with other adult women of the community.
				<lb facs='#facs_108_r_6_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>The initiatory sessions are announced by means of a
				<lb facs='#facs_108_r_6_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>circular sent around in the form of a small piece of sokolo,
				<lb facs='#facs_108_r_6_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>tobacco. Fees, money, cloth or other commodities are
				<lb facs='#facs_108_r_6_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>due at this time. The number of initiates depends on both

				<lb facs='#facs_109_r_4_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>town. The next three days are spent on the verandas of
				<lb facs='#facs_109_r_4_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>their parents' houses, where they receive the admiration
				<lb facs='#facs_109_r_4_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>of friends and relatives.?
				<lb facs='#facs_109_r_4_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>With the attainment of this level of initiation, a woman
				<lb facs='#facs_109_r_4_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>may commission a mask to be made. She chooses a carver
				<lb facs='#facs_109_r_4_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>familiar with the rituals and symbols of the society and
				<lb facs='#facs_109_r_4_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>tells him the name of the ancestor for her mask; he then
				<lb facs='#facs_109_r_4_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>secludes himself in the bush to visualize the spirit that will
				<lb facs='#facs_109_r_4_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>eventually inhabit it. The carvers are always men, in ac
				<lb facs='#facs_109_r_4_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>cord with the tradition of strict division of labor.
				<lb facs='#facs_109_r_4_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>However, the mask provides a perspective on the
				<lb facs='#facs_109_r_4_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>initiated woman's power. It is during the masked ritual,
				<lb facs='#facs_109_r_4_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>private and public, that the Bundu appear so formidable.
				<lb facs='#facs_109_r_4_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>They surround themselves with the exotic, the mysterious,
				<lb facs='#facs_109_r_4_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>and the grotesque. This aura is confirmed by the visible
				<lb facs='#facs_109_r_4_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>and invisible accoutrements of masks, costumes, dances
				<lb facs='#facs_109_r_4_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>and sounds—or silence and secrecy. With all of these
				<lb facs='#facs_109_r_4_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>means, the Bundu invokes the Goddess of the Mask, who
				<lb facs='#facs_109_r_4_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>is called Sowei.° Sowei is the personification of all those
				<lb facs='#facs_109_r_4_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>aspects of the ideal and powerful associated with Earth
				<lb facs='#facs_109_r_4_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>Mother and Queen. She is clearly a cult object to be wor
				<lb facs='#facs_109_r_4_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>shipped and revered by men and women. The iconog
				<lb facs='#facs_109_r_4_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>raphy of the mask is material and sensual, which further
				<lb facs='#facs_109_r_4_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>reflects this ideal.
				<lb facs='#facs_109_r_4_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>The mask illustrated here is from the Sherbro Islands,
				<lb facs='#facs_109_r_4_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>off the coast of Sierra Leone in West Africa. The basic
				<lb facs='#facs_109_r_4_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>form of the mask, and others of its kind, is a bell shape or
				<lb facs='#facs_109_r_4_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>helmet. The most prominent feature is the bulging ringed
				<lb facs='#facs_109_r_4_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>neck, which suggests wealth, fertility and beauty." This
				<lb facs='#facs_109_r_4_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>aspect expresses the Mende equation of corpulence with
				<lb facs='#facs_109_r_4_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>fertility and is reminiscent of Goddesses and female icons.
				<lb facs='#facs_109_r_4_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>The forehead and cheeks are protruding and round, also
				<lb facs='#facs_109_r_4_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>implying corpulence. Erich Neumann, in his book The
				<lb facs='#facs_109_r_4_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>Great Mother, writes: "One means by which early man
				<lb facs='#facs_109_r_4_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>could represent the numinous magnificence and arche

				<lb facs='#facs_109_r_4_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>sive 'exaggeration' of form and an accentuation of her
				<lb facs='#facs_109_r_4_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>elementary character""° (suggesting her fertility).
				<lb facs='#facs_109_r_4_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>The slit eyes and closed mouth symbolize the fact that
				<lb facs='#facs_109_r_4_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>the Bundu spirit never speaks. Her silence is equated with
				<lb facs='#facs_109_r_4_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>power and judgment. When she wishes to communicate,
				<lb facs='#facs_109_r_4_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>she does so through one of the lower members of the
				<lb facs='#facs_109_r_4_1_tl_45' n='N045'/>Bundu, a Ligba.
				<lb facs='#facs_109_r_4_1_tl_46' n='N046'/>The elaborate braided pattern of the hair indicates the
				<lb facs='#facs_109_r_4_1_tl_47' n='N047'/>importance placed on this feature. Emblematically, hair is
				<lb facs='#facs_109_r_4_1_tl_48' n='N048'/>power. The braid may be interpreted in the same manner
				<lb facs='#facs_109_r_4_1_tl_49' n='N049'/>as the entwined snakes found on the waist of the principal
				<lb facs='#facs_109_r_4_1_tl_50' n='N050'/>Goddess figure at Knossos or perhaps in the same way as
				<lb facs='#facs_109_r_4_1_tl_51' n='N051'/>the snake hair of the Gorgons. The snake, a lower earth
				<lb facs='#facs_109_r_4_1_tl_52' n='N052'/>symbol of fertility, represents the Terrible Mother."1 Em
				<lb facs='#facs_109_r_4_1_tl_53' n='N053'/>bedded in the hair of this mask are small phylacteries,
				<lb facs='#facs_109_r_4_1_tl_54' n='N054'/>serving as both ornamental and totemic references to
				<lb facs='#facs_109_r_4_1_tl_55' n='N055'/>Islam.1
				<lb facs='#facs_109_r_4_1_tl_56' n='N056'/>The horns on the helmet are considered to have special
				<lb facs='#facs_109_r_4_1_tl_57' n='N057'/>energy. The Mende and other African tribes believe that
				<lb facs='#facs_109_r_4_1_tl_58' n='N058'/>horns are the repository of an animal's power or life force
				<lb facs='#facs_109_r_4_1_tl_59' n='N059'/>Horns are also tied around the neck or waist of children to
				<lb facs='#facs_109_r_4_1_tl_60' n='N060'/>protect them from evil spirits.13, Tribal members believe
				<lb facs='#facs_109_r_4_1_tl_61' n='N061'/>that they can psychically identify with a particular animal
				<lb facs='#facs_109_r_4_1_tl_62' n='N062'/>and have access to its powers to protect themselves from
				<lb facs='#facs_109_r_4_1_tl_63' n='N063'/>known and unknown spirits. The adopted object or animal
				<lb facs='#facs_109_r_4_1_tl_64' n='N064'/>is called a "bush soul.
				<lb facs='#facs_109_r_4_1_tl_65' n='N065'/>On top of the mask is a bird perched on a cup. One
				<lb facs='#facs_109_r_4_1_tl_66' n='N066'/>interpretation is that the bird symbolizes spiritual tran
				<lb facs='#facs_109_r_4_1_tl_67' n='N067'/>scendence. Another, specific to the Mende, is that this is

				<lb facs='#facs_110_r_1_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>The woman who commissions a mask decides whether
				<lb facs='#facs_110_r_1_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>it is satisfactory and then performs a ritual inviting the
				<lb facs='#facs_110_r_1_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>spirit to enter the mask. Before the spirit can enter, how
				<lb facs='#facs_110_r_1_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>ever, the Bundu costume must be complete. Raffia, dyed
				<lb facs='#facs_110_r_1_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>black, is attached to the mask, and a cloth suit with the
				<lb facs='#facs_110_r_1_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>sleeve ends sewn closed is worn over long black stockings
				<lb facs='#facs_110_r_1_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>and shoes. By completely covering her body, the dancer
				<lb facs='#facs_110_r_1_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>prevents the spirit from entering her rather than entering
				<lb facs='#facs_110_r_1_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>the mask.15
				<lb facs='#facs_110_r_1_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>The masked dancer may carry a bunch of twigs or a

				<lb facs='#facs_110_r_1_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>When the masked Bundu woman appears in public with
				<lb facs='#facs_110_r_1_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>her musicians, it generally means that somebody (usually
				<lb facs='#facs_110_r_1_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>a male) is going to be accused of an offense against Bundu
				<lb facs='#facs_110_r_1_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>laws.17 The violator will be brought before the masked

				<lb facs='#facs_110_r_1_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>mask, the Bundu woman listens without reply, but she
				<lb facs='#facs_110_r_1_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>conveys her spirit's judgment through the Ligbas, the first
				<lb facs='#facs_110_r_1_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>level members of the Bundu society.18
				<lb facs='#facs_110_r_1_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>To move beyond a description of the aesthetic and
				<lb facs='#facs_110_r_1_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>exotic is to consider the Bundu woman as a force in a
				<lb facs='#facs_110_r_1_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>patriarchal society. Historically, African societies have
				<lb facs='#facs_110_r_1_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>recognized female power. The Bantu had queens without
				<lb facs='#facs_110_r_1_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>prince consorts. Independent queens ruled the Fanti on
				<lb facs='#facs_110_r_1_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>the Gold Coast, which was the center of a matriarchy.
				<lb facs='#facs_110_r_1_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>There were female rulers throughout the entire Zambesi
				<lb facs='#facs_110_r_1_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>area in the northern Congo basin. In Togoland, the queens
				<lb facs='#facs_110_r_1_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>had chieftains to help rule, but the latter could make
				<lb facs='#facs_110_r_1_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>decisions only with the consent of a female council. The
				<lb facs='#facs_110_r_1_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>West African matriarchy extended to the Atlantic Islands.
				<lb facs='#facs_110_r_1_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>Helen Diner, in Mothers and Amazons, writes: "In the

				<lb facs='#facs_110_r_2_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>cases there was no question of a creative act, but of magic

				<lb facs='#facs_115_r_1_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>Nevertheless, a significant number of women today still

				<lb facs='#facs_117_r_4_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>involving women—by reference to older or interpolated

				<lb facs='#facs_120_r_2_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>through a time of mourning, of purgatory. Purgatory is the

				<lb facs='#facs_120_r_3_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>and learning to cook. I have a few dolls, mostly given by
				<lb facs='#facs_120_r_3_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>my grandmother. I sew clothes for one or two of them,
				<lb facs='#facs_120_r_3_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>but mainly the dolls stay on the closet shelf. Rather than

				<lb facs='#facs_120_r_3_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>to school, they are tailored, contrasting with my younger

				<lb facs='#facs_120_r_3_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>the first time, and I turn my lips away.

				<lb facs='#facs_121_r_2_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>marks on my breasts and thighs. I pay as little attention to
				<lb facs='#facs_121_r_2_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>my body as possible.
				<lb facs='#facs_121_r_2_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>Externally, the pregnancy goes very smoothly. I move
				<lb facs='#facs_121_r_2_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>out of the dormitory at five and a half months, when few
				<lb facs='#facs_121_r_2_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>people know that I am going to have a baby. I move into a

				<lb facs='#facs_121_r_2_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>live there for three months. I eat well and lightly, like to

				<lb facs='#facs_121_r_2_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>with adopted parents. I walk out with a friend's assistance
				<lb facs='#facs_121_r_2_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>after paying a fifty-cent fee.
				<lb facs='#facs_121_r_2_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>The strain and trauma, the sense of failure and help

				<lb facs='#facs_121_r_2_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>cannot continue as though nothing has happened. My
				<lb facs='#facs_121_r_2_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>acute sense of loss and emptiness demands retreat and
				<lb facs='#facs_121_r_2_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>rest. During the pregnancy I’d continued to live fairly

				<lb facs='#facs_121_r_2_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>mainly being alone. After the delivery I need comfort and

				<lb facs='#facs_121_r_2_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>after the delivery are strained. The time is painful, and our
				<lb facs='#facs_121_r_2_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>relationship ends when he goes to Denver.
				<lb facs='#facs_121_r_2_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>Now that the pregnancy is over I begin a long process
				<lb facs='#facs_121_r_2_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>of slowly paying more attention to my body, learning

				<lb facs='#facs_121_r_2_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>in body therapy and practicing yoga. Living in my body
				<lb facs='#facs_121_r_2_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>becomes increasingly important. After I stop using birth

				<lb facs='#facs_121_r_2_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>becoming pregnant again. Though I am using a diaphram,
				<lb facs='#facs_121_r_2_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>I give tremendous energy each month to this fear, to

				<lb facs='#facs_121_r_3_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>My pregnancy at eighteen was my birth. The labor was
				<lb facs='#facs_121_r_3_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>very long and difficult and painful. I don't even know
				<lb facs='#facs_121_r_3_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>when the delivery was over, but my second pregnancy
				<lb facs='#facs_121_r_3_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>and abortion ten years later tell me that it is. I am ending
				<lb facs='#facs_121_r_3_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>a cycle of living in other people's houses, both literally
				<lb facs='#facs_121_r_3_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>and figuratively, of fulfilling other people's expectations
				<lb facs='#facs_121_r_3_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>During the ten-year interval I accomplished much, all
				<lb facs='#facs_121_r_3_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>capable of doing whatever I choose to do. I have proved
				<lb facs='#facs_121_r_3_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>myself again and again. My abortion put me in touch with
				<lb facs='#facs_121_r_3_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>my body on a higher level, with my sexuality and my vul

				<lb facs='#facs_121_r_3_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>cycle is ended, I do not clearly see the next one. To be
				<lb facs='#facs_121_r_3_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>willing to wait, to see what is emerging, is the essence of
				<lb facs='#facs_121_r_3_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>the feminine in me, and may also be the meaning of my

				<lb facs='#facs_121_r_3_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>the childhood of my psyche, my spiritual childhood.

				<lb facs='#facs_122_r_3_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>Few would link any positive idea of feminism with the
				<lb facs='#facs_122_r_3_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>present-day phenomenon of the café belly dancer—as
				<lb facs='#facs_122_r_3_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>sociated with that blatant sex object, the burlesque strip
				<lb facs='#facs_122_r_3_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>per of our Western culture, as she accepts the dollar bills

				<lb facs='#facs_122_r_3_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>there is good reason to do so. Correlating the history of
				<lb facs='#facs_122_r_3_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>the so-called belly dance with archeological evidences of
				<lb facs='#facs_122_r_3_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>early matriarchal civilization, research into pagan wicca,
				<lb facs='#facs_122_r_3_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>worship of the Earth Mother Goddess, and a study of
				<lb facs='#facs_122_r_3_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>primitive obstetrics, I have come to the logical conclusion
				<lb facs='#facs_122_r_3_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>that the belly dance, probably the most ancient form of
				<lb facs='#facs_122_r_3_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>dance known to civilization, was originally performed by
				<lb facs='#facs_122_r_3_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>women to celebrate, nurture and invoke her magical abil

				<lb facs='#facs_122_r_3_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>born and mysteriously die, probably viewed the muscular
				<lb facs='#facs_122_r_3_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>contractions that expel the infant from the womb as some
				<lb facs='#facs_122_r_3_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>awesome hocus-pocus of creation.
				<lb facs='#facs_122_r_3_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>Though the instinctive ability to bear down and give
				<lb facs='#facs_122_r_3_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>with nature's contractions has been quite lost to modern

				<lb facs='#facs_122_r_3_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>shimmies, too, of the swelling breasts that fill so magically
				<lb facs='#facs_122_r_3_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>with the milk that sustains newborn life.
				<lb facs='#facs_122_r_3_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>Significantly, the present-day, café version of the
				<lb facs='#facs_122_r_3_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>dance still features a portion known as the "floor work" in
				<lb facs='#facs_122_r_3_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>which the dancer, to a slower, more improvised rhythm,
				<lb facs='#facs_122_r_3_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>descends to the floor, and, kneeling, leans back and
				<lb facs='#facs_122_r_3_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>works her stomach muscles in a series of contractions.
				<lb facs='#facs_122_r_3_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>theorize that this section of the dance, really its dramatic

				<lb facs='#facs_122_r_3_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>(the dancer refraining from smiling as she does elsewhere
				<lb facs='#facs_122_r_3_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>in the dance), is probably the residue of an ancient rite
				<lb facs='#facs_122_r_3_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>which either mimed or actualized the act of giving birth
				<lb facs='#facs_122_r_3_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>as primitive women did, kneeling or squatting, in full

				<lb facs='#facs_122_r_3_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>often is, is followed by a faster, more joyous, upbeat
				<lb facs='#facs_122_r_3_1_tl_45' n='N045'/>ending, which, in the Turkish style, still retains remnants
				<lb facs='#facs_122_r_3_1_tl_46' n='N046'/>of a mime indicating the grinding of grain and the kneading
				<lb facs='#facs_122_r_3_1_tl_47' n='N047'/>of bread, highly respected occupations of early vegetarian
				<lb facs='#facs_122_r_3_1_tl_48' n='N048'/>matriarchates. The fertility dance, now viewed as a tourist

				<lb facs='#facs_122_r_4_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>birth was an ecstatic and publicly celebrated event rather
				<lb facs='#facs_122_r_4_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>than a sterile and private horror locked away in a male
				<lb facs='#facs_122_r_4_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>obstetrician's "delivery" room.
				<lb facs='#facs_122_r_4_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>In less Westernized corners of the Middle East, the
				<lb facs='#facs_122_r_4_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>"birth dance" was still performed, at least as late as the
				<lb facs='#facs_122_r_4_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>1960s, around a woman in labor by her fellow tribes
				<lb facs='#facs_122_r_4_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>women. In this form, it was a ritual which men were not
				<lb facs='#facs_122_r_4_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>allowed to watch—its purpose being to hypnotize the
				<lb facs='#facs_122_r_4_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>woman in labor into giving with her contractions, thus
				<lb facs='#facs_122_r_4_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>avoiding the pain of strained muscles. We don't need to
				<lb facs='#facs_122_r_4_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>be reminded that ours is one of the few cultures in the
				<lb facs='#facs_122_r_4_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>world that expects women to go from fairly sedentary
				<lb facs='#facs_122_r_4_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>lives into the strenuous labor of giving birth (equivalent to
				<lb facs='#facs_122_r_4_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>running a six mile race) without adequate preparation of
				<lb facs='#facs_122_r_4_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>the muscles involved. However, among primitive peoples,
				<lb facs='#facs_122_r_4_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>there are many examples of therapy dances which involve
				<lb facs='#facs_122_r_4_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>the pelvis and abdomen. Modern Hawaiians have probab

				<lb facs='#facs_126_r_3_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>After these many years of digging about in the

				<lb facs='#facs_126_r_3_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>me that by accepting and continually confirming the
				<lb facs='#facs_126_r_3_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>idea that we are living in the year 1978 (though we
				<lb facs='#facs_126_r_3_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>take it so for granted), we might well be inherently
				<lb facs='#facs_126_r_3_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>limiting our chronological perceptions and thus our

				<lb facs='#facs_126_r_3_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>part of the past. I wondered—if I began to date my

				<lb facs='#facs_126_r_3_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>ceived them laugh at what they might assume was

				<lb facs='#facs_126_r_3_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>does this have to do with the Great Goddess? Let me
				<lb facs='#facs_126_r_3_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>explain.
				<lb facs='#facs_126_r_3_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>Having grown progressively more aware of the
				<lb facs='#facs_126_r_3_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>subtle but insidious effects of sexist language and

				<lb facs='#facs_126_r_3_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>By accepting the idea that this is the year 1978, it
				<lb facs='#facs_126_r_3_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>seems to me that our overall view of the evolution of
				<lb facs='#facs_126_r_3_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>human development is being affected in a most
				<lb facs='#facs_126_r_3_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>basic yet unquestioned manner. In fact, I suggest
				<lb facs='#facs_126_r_3_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>that this acceptance actually perverts and distorts
				<lb facs='#facs_126_r_3_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>our perception of the continuity and transitional

				<lb facs='#facs_126_r_3_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>consider how this annual dating system influences
				<lb facs='#facs_126_r_3_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>our conceptions—and preconceptions—of God

				<lb facs='#facs_126_r_3_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>and of the status and roles of women through the

				<lb facs='#facs_126_r_4_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>made possible by the underlying permission granted
				<lb facs='#facs_126_r_4_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>by the hotly contested theory of evolution as pre

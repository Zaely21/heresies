				<p>The body is the image relator. In ritual, we embody and activate images of
				the archetypal, the eternal feminine,
				the goddess. Images of power, of transformation, of harmony and of duality
				One woman empowering another. The
				crucial exchange of gifts. I cross the circle to give you something; you cross
				the circle to give her something. And so
				on until we have all changed places.
				Power held is powerless; power given is
				power for all. In feminist ritual we maintain a center of which we are all aware.
				It is our collective heart which beat
				there. We hold together, our center
				endures. Even the most painful separation, the dispersal which is feared
				but necessary, cannot disconnect us
				from that ritual circle. Once that circle
				is created and affirmed, chaos is subdued. We survive. We thrive</p>
				<p>Although some theoretical attention
				has been given to the recent spiritual
				awakening within the women’s movement, very little writing has been directed toward analysis of the use of ritual
				by women. What do these ritual acts
				mean to contemporary U.S. feministsi
				And what is their significance in terms
				of the women's movement?</p>
				<p>Feminists are primarily at work revising the male-biased ideological
				bases of culture; some are now engaged in the creation of rituals to promote and sanction this serious turning
				away from the old to the new. As in
				traditional societies, feminist ritual
				provides an emotional, descriptive,
				intensified and sanctifying version of
				emergent ideological systems. Feminist ritual offers an imagistic revitalization for women, participation in the
				concrete, bodily expressive creation of
				new images of the feminine which will
				help alleviate the stress of a liminality.</p>
				<p>The evaluation of culture by Michelle
			</p>
			<p>
				Zimbalist Rosaldo in her theoretical
				overview for Woman, Culture and Society serves as useful background material for answering why women have created rituals as an expression of the
				need for revitalization and as an impetus for political action. First, Rosaldo
				establishes a model for interpreting the
				difference in status between men and
				women, a model based on extensive
				contemporary cross-cultural analysis
				of male/female roles and behavior
				She states that "an asymmetry in the
				cultural evaluations of male and female, in the importance assigned to
			</p>
         	<figure></figure>
			<p>
				women and men, appears to be universal.”<note>1. Michelle Zimbalist Rosaldo, "A The
					oretical Overview," in Woman, Culture
					and Society, ed. Michelle Zimbalist Rosaldo and Louise Lamphere (Stanford:
					University Press. 1974), p. 19.</note> This asymmetry is manifested in</p>
				<quote>the fact that male, as opposed to female,
				activities are always recognized as predominantly important, and cultural systems give authority and value to the roles
				and activities of men. ...Everywhere
				from those societies we might want to
				call most egalitarian to those in which
				sexual stratification is most marked,
				men are the locus of cultural value.<note>2. Rosaldo, pp. 19-20</note></quote>
				<p>Over the past few thousand years
				women have not been culturally granted a legitimate, overt way of demonstrating their power, their personhood.
				Only men define, possess and confer
				power or authority, and power is the
			</p>
			<p>
				necessary ingredient for the creation of
				culture. Women are therefore consigned to live on the fringes of culture,
				locked in domestic zones which are
				rarely defined as part of the cultural
				territory. Rosaldo elaborates this point
				by using Mary Douglas’s notion of “the
				anomalous."</p>
				<quote>Recent studies of symbolic culture have
				suggested that whatever violates a society’s sense of order will be seen as threatening, nasty, disorderly, orwrong. Douglas
				has called this sort of thing"anomalous.
				The idea of "order" depends, logically
				on "disorder” as its opposite, yet society
				tries to set such things aside. Insofar
				as men. . define the public order women are their opposite. Where men are
				classified in terms of ranked, institutional positions, women are simply women
				and their activities, interests and differences receive only idiosyncratic note.<note>3. Rosaldo, p. 31.</note></quote>
				<p>Women are anomalies in most cultures
				and have no cultural recourse for demonstrating the reality of female power
				Female power is almost without exception displayed covertly under the rubric
				of influence or association with the
				right man. But Rosaldo makes a unique
				claim for the possible use women may
				make of their anomalous or liminal positions. Even though women's status is
				lowest in those societies where there is
				the greatest distinction between the
				public and domestic realms and where
				women are isolated from each other,
				"their position is raised when they can
				challenge those claims of male authority, either by taking on men’s roles or
				by establishing social ties, by creating a
				sense of rank, order, and value in a
				world in which women prevail."<note>4. Rosaldo, p. 36.</note> It is
				also clear that historically women have
				taken on very active roles in social systems by "manipulating, elaborating, or
				undermining” their domestic roles and
				by stressing their differences from men.
				In other words, by giving special attention to their anomalous status, women
				have been able "to take on powers
				uniquely their own.”<note>5. Rosaldo, p. 38.</note> Especially pertinent to our discussion, Rosaldo mentions
			</p>
			<pb n='21'/>
			<p>
				the roles of nun, midwife, witch
				and religious prostitute as making particularly positive use of women's
				"anomalous" sexuality. "These examples suggest that the very symbolic
				and social conceptions [the notions of
				purity and pollution associated with
				women) that appear to set women apart
				and to circumscribe their activities may
				be used by women as a basis for female
				solidarity and worth."<note>6. Rosaldo, p. 39.</note></p>
				<p>Of course it is most significant that
				these roles include the classic examples
				of women who have been allowed to
				utilize ritual means as a source of gaining and transterring power. Men have
			</p>
         	<figure></figure>
			<p>
				tenaciously held the rights to ritual
				use since the suppression of the
				ancient priestesses of the goddess. In
				fact the participation in ritual by men
				has been their most profound display
				of cultural authority and their most
				direct access to it. The performance
				of ritual in most societies, "primitive'
				and "civilized," is a simultaneous acknowledgment of men's warrant to
				create and define culture and, by exclusion, a sign to women to keep in
				their place, a place which we have already designated as outside culture
				and without the symbolic or real attributes of power.</p>
				<p>Here we see a further distinction between the sacred and the profane
				based on the asymmetry of male-female relationships. Men have claimed
				sacred space as their locus for effecting control over and/or maintaining
				harmony with each other and the fates.
				As Mircea Eliade has shown, sacred
				space is "manifested space,” it is created as sacred by men and in most societies women have little or no access to
				it.<note>7. Mircea Eliade, Shamanism (Princeton
				Princeton University Press, 1964)</note> Women live in the profane world,
				the world that is, the world that is incapable of being transformed or of
				transforming those who live in it. Of
				course men live in the profane world
				too (in fact we all live there most of the
				time), but when they choose to do so
			</p>
			<p>
				(or when the "gods" command them to
				do so) they may enter another world, a
				world of the sacred, and through ritual
				practice they may take part in ordering
				that world and themselves. The sacred
				realm is that of being and becoming, a
				realm saturated with power and critically "off-limits" to the female half of the
				human species.</p>
				<p>That women in the United-States and
				elsewhere have begun to claim sacred
				space for themselves, to create rituals
				which emphasize their loyalty to each
				other and finally name the powers
				which men have found "anomalous”
				(i.e., nameless) is indeed an ultimate,
				radical (proceeding from the root) affirmation of the revolutionary potential
				of the feminist movement. Ässerting
				the right to ritual means as a source of
				power, vision and solidarity is the symbolic corollary of equal pay, choice of
				abortion, domestic freedom, the establishment of women’s businesses, etc.
				Successful and enduring change in the
				status of women will come only through
				the parallel transformation of symbols
				and realities. Feminist ritual practice is
				currently the most important model for
				symbolic and, therefore, psychic and
				spiritual change in women</p>
				<p>Here I would like to describe briefly
				a number of feminist rituals which
				characterize the kind and variety of expression this form has taken.</p>
				<p>In her Spotted Bundle Enclosures
				Jody Pinto digs out old brick wells
				outside Philadelphia. At the bottom of
				these wells she leaves personal and
				found objects wrapped in animal skins.
				Next to these bundles Pinto makes a
				primitive fireplace with shards and
				cooking utensils. She constructs a ladder and leaves it down the side of the
				well as an invitation for others to come
				in. Reflecting on the creation of these
				ritual sites and her activity in them,
				Pinto writes, “The other day I spread
				wings/split a man in half/spent a year in
				the earth/excavated my own tomb/
				rolled over/cut out my heart/and ate it."<note>8. Lucy Lippard, “Quite Contrary: Body,
					Nature, Ritual in Women’s Art," Chrysalis
					(Autumn 1977), p. 38</note></p>
				<p>Donna Henes’s Spider Woman Series
				involves web-building in natural and
				urban environments. Henes defines
				web-making as the "most basic female
				instinct" and has made a personal ritual of web-making over the past three
				years.<note>9. Lippard, p. 43. Also personal communication</note></p>
				<p>Margi Gumpert, a witch by trade and
				by faith, performs a specific ritual
				whenever she enters a public bathroom.</p>
				<quote>I often notice that the mirror reflects an
				image which makes me question myselt,
				feel critical or dissatisfied with my appearance. I don’t ignore it as trivial,
			</quote>
			<p>
				because I recognize that the mirror is
				infested with a very common political
				poison, virus hollywoodius or televisioniensis, subtle pressure to measure up to a
				pattern designed to enslave. Just to free
				myself of that pressure isn’t a magical
				operation. But hundreds of other women
				will use that mirror. So after I have
				cleared my own image of that false
				cloud, I usually perform some sort of
				magical activity to neutralize the poison.
				pour suggestive energy into the mirror,
				encouraging anyone who might look in it
				to see herself in her true beauty. I reinforce the suggestion with all the power
				of my will and call on the Goddess of
				Beauty Herself, blessed Aphrodite, to
				banish that which would deny Her, as
				She exists in all of us."<note>10. Margi Gumpert, “Witchcraft," Country
					Women (April 1974), p. 27</note></p>
				<p>A ritual for the Autumn Equinox is
				performed yearly by a group of women
				living in the country near Wolf Creek,
				Oregon</p>
				<quote>Let friends gather, each bringing with her
				an article which represents a recent
				accomplishment— some self-chosen task
				she has completed. Let a circle form and
				each one place her article in front of her,
				and next to it a fruit, seed or cone. Join
				hands and chant in unison the names of
				all present—several times till the energy
				is high. Then pause and chant the months
				of the year from the Winter Solstice to
				the Autumn Equinox.
			</quote>
         	<figure></figure>
			<quote>
				Now let each one in turn hold her article
				while she tells her friends of her accomplishment and something she has learned
				from it. When all have spoken all shall
				pick up the fruit, seed or cone in front of
				them and picture inwardly the process of
				its change from seed to plant to flower
				to seed.</quote>
				<quote>Again let each woman speak in turn of
				what her accomplishment has meant to
				her growth and how she thinks it may be
				useful to her self and others. At this
				time if she feels grateful, let her give
				thanks. If she wants to dance, let her
				move. When all have expressed their
				feeling, with closed eyes ask yourself
				"What is the next stage in the process of
				my growth?” Ask your inner self for
				energy and guidance to continue.

				<p>On the streets of downtown Boston a
				woman wearing a high feather headdress makes a circle of cornmeal,
				places three ears of corn in the center
				of the circle and begins a rhythmic
				chant naming the goddesses of the
				Americas before the conquest (Tonantzin, Chicomecoaltl, Blue Corn Girl,
				IxChel, etc.) After the chant is finished,
				she calls on women passing by, invites
				them into the circle and blesses them
				by saying in litany form an ancient Aztec poem from the Poesia Nahautl:</p>
				<lg><l>Now o friends</l>
				<l>Listen to the words of a dream</l>
				<l>Each spring brings us new life</l>
				<l>The golden corn refreshes us</l>
				<l>And the pink corn makes us a necklace</l>
				<l>At least this we know:</l>
				<l>The hearts of our friends are true.</l></lg>
				<p>While the women alternate in speaking
				the lines of the poem to each other,
				they hold an ear of corn between them
				and tear the sheaves down exposing the
				fresh corn. This ritual has been performed from coast to coast with at
				least 300 women receiving the blessing
				since it was first done in 1975.<note>12. Observed at the Conference “Through
					the Looking Glass: A Cynergenetic Experience," Boston, Mass., April 23-25

				<p>In northern California several women have constructed menstrual huts as
				ritual retreats where they can go during
				their monthly periods. Painting the red
				quarter moon on their foreheads as a
				symbol of their special condition, they
				use the time spent in the hut for experiencing and affirming the culmination
				of cyclic process. It is a time for meditation and separation, but separation
				without the patriarchal connotations of
				impurity, defilement and unworthiness.
				The menstrual flow is equated with the
				particular power of the feminine and
				time spent apart in the hut is for personally determining the course of that
				power.<note>13. Ruth Mountaingrove and Emily Culpepper, "Menstruation: Body and Spirit,
					Womanspirit (June 1976), p. 64</note></p>
				<p>The following ritual was recounted
				in Sundance, a journal devoted to the
				study and sharing of dreams.</p>
				<quote>In a past issue of Womanspirit there is an
				article by Hallie Mountainwing describing an overnight wilderness event attended by twelve women. The purpose of
				the venture was to share dreams, become deeper friends and explore the
				meaning to each of them of being women. To prepare for dreaming together,
				the twelve women arranged their sleeping bags into a "wheel” surrounding a
				central pole. In addition, each woman
			</quote>
			<quote>
				had two strands of ribbon attached to
				her sleeping bag which were then attached to the pole, making a "dream
				net." The arrangement is quite similar to
				the May Pole and Sun Dance ceremonies,
				except, in this case, the people are lying
				down, asleep and dreaming. As an approximation to a contemporary experiment in revelation, a twelve-person
				"dream wheel” inspires continued exploration.<note>14. Henry Reed, Ed., Sundance (Spring 1977

				recorded in 1930 by Basauri and translated by J. Eric Thompson in his “The
				Moon Goddess in Central America."
				The ceremony is called “the song of
				the roses," KAIK' MIKTE.</p>
				<quote>A hollow is made in a level place and
				filled with water. This hollow should be
				of sufficient size so that a woman may
				take a bath in it. The woman, who hopes
				to benefit from the ceremony is placed
				in it completely naked. Once she is in
				and the liquid reaches to the height of
				her breasts, they [other women who participate in the ceremony) cover the surface with flowers. Several women, friends
				of the one to be benefited, the numben
				of which may vary, but never falls below
				five, take hands and dance around the
				bather, some singing and others saying a
				prayer in Maya. The dance lasts an hour
				and during that time the dancers take
				flowers which they have already prepared, stoop down to moisten them in
				the water in which the principal bathes,
				and throw them on the breast of the
				woman making the ceremony (la solicitante). During the dance it is the custom to make nine turns in one direction,
				stop a moment to moisten the flowers,
				and then repeat the same number of
				turns in the opposite direction. When the
				ceremony is ended, the dancers retire,
				the woman remains alone in the water,
				and, on coming out, she takes a quantity
				of it, which she carries with her to employ in the preparation of her husband's
				or lover's food."<note>15. J. Eric Thompson, “The Moon Goddess in
					Central America” (Carnegie Institute of
					Washington Pub. 509, Contribution 29

				<p>Although the ritual is ostensibly
				practiced to make their lovers remain
				faithful, the beauty of the ceremony
				lies in its kinship with all ritual acts,
				both past and present, which describe
				the healing, nurturing effect of tribal
				sisterhood. The overt goal of the ritual
				is not the only reason for performing it;
				something significant is taking place in
				the act of perfórmance too. An individual woman is uplifted and sacralized by her sisters, her comadres,
				her C-R group, her kind.</p>
				<p>The above presentation of woman’s rituals is by no means exhaustive.
			</p>
			<p>
				In fact thę range of expressive material in current feminist ritual sets is so
				diverse, multivocal and widespread
				that one of the major tasks of the historical branch of the women's movement must be to document the growth
				of ritual events. Someone must also
				take on the project of assembling what
				cross-cultural historical evidence exists
				of women’s rituals such as the KAIK
				MIKTE</p>
				<p>In “The Qualitative Leap Beyond
				Patriarchal Religion," theologian Mary
				Daly makes the following statement:</p>
				<quote>The Women’s revolution is not merely
				about equality within a patriarchal society (a contradiction in terms). It is about
				power and redefining power. Within
				patriarchy, power is generally understood as power over people, the environment, things. In the rising consciousness
				of women, power is experienced as
				power of presence to ourselves and to
				each other, as we affirm our own being
				against and beyond the alienated identity bestowed upon us within the patriarchy. This is experienced as power of
				absence by those who would objectify
				women as ’the other, as magnifying
				mirrors.<note>16. Mary Daly, “The Qualitative Leap Beyond Patriarchal Religion," Quest (Vol. 1,
					No. 1), p. 21</note></quote>
				<p>Daly’s insistence that redefinition of
				power is a central goal of the women's
				movement is crucial for understanding
				the use of ritual by feminists, a symbolic model for discovering how to give
				and get."power of presence." One
				woman empowers another (or herself)
				through reaffirmation of the body as an
				instrument of communion (not alienation).</p>
				<p>None of the rituals mentioned above
				would be considered effective if a
				transfer of power had not resulted. Yet
				it is of critical importance to note that
				power is rarely considered an object of
				possession which the group or individual may get hold of during ritual activity.
				What is stressed through ritual is the
				dynamic quality of power, the continual exchange of gifts which heightens
				the affirmative identity of all who participate. Power emanates from within
				as it is simultaneously received from
				without. For women in revolution it is
				imperative to create an entirely new
				value system, the heart of which will be
				a dramatic reassessment of the use of
				power. Ritual serves as a primary way
				of affirming commitment to that reassessment. The ritual setting provides
				a place for knowing the easy, direct
				exchange and sharing of power. Certainly ritual is an idealized microcosmic experience, but it may be an endurably important means of invoking a
				new order of things in the macrocosm.
				At the very least it has been a useful
			</p>
			<pb n='23'/>
			<p>
				mode for envisioning what a different
				world for women might feel like.</p>
				<p>The word "feeling” deserves special
				mention in connection with women's
				rituals. In fact it is a word we must
				never neglect in talking about any ritual. Evon Vogt once asked a ritual participant, "Why do you go through the
				ceremonies? Why do you do what you
				do?" The participant replied, “To fee
				better, I want to make myself feel better."<note>17. Evon Vogt, Tortillas for the Cods (Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1976)</note> In the context of ritual women
				are creating a space in which to feel
				better, to feel more, to feel the past as
				well as the future. Perhaps most important is the way in which ritual upholds and celebrates the validity of
				feeling as a mode of revelation, communication and transvaluation. In
				some of the rituals described above the
				flow of feelings, change in feelings or
				sharing of feelings with others is a highly desirable goal in performing the ritual.</p>
				<p>In discussing the reasons underlying
				the performance of ritual acts in the
				feminist community, we must underscore the importance of ritual as a
				formalized consecration of female
				bonding. The ritual concretization of
				the idea reflected in the popular feminist slogan "Sisterhood is Powerful" is
				extremely important in demonstrating
				the cohesiveness and commitment of
				the feminist community. A primary
				function of ritual is to connect the individual with the group—dramatically,
				indissoluably. In ritual the desire is to
				achieve shared meanings, shared resolutions, shared emotion, not to promote private images or dreams. The
				specific rites which comprise many
				feminist rituals reaffirm relationship,
				belonging and identity. Ritual acts
				maintain a symbolic center of which all
				the participants are aware. This center
				is a place to which one can return for
				support and comfort long after the
				ceremony has ended. A relational or
				ideological bond cemented formally
				through ritual procedure is nothing if
				not enduring.</p>
				<p>Being capable of membership in a
				group and finding ways of expressing
				that membership and acting it out are
				necessary for the success of any political revolution. Let us not forget that
				less than ten years ago Lionel Tiger told
				us "women do not bond”<note>18. Lionel Tiger, Men in Groups (New York:
					Random House, 1969)</note> and in so
				saying implied women are incapable
				of creating significant political institutions. It is already evident that women
				have effected widespread social
				change (to enumerate the accomplishments to date would fill pages) since
				the formal resumption of the feminist
			</p>
			<p>
				movement in 1967. Ritual participation
				will no doubt stimulate further and
				deeper political change for there is, indeed, a continuum between ritual and
				everyday life for feminists. The female
				bonds established in ritual lend incentive to the female bonds that inspire social change. The use of ritual
				is significant as a source for the renewal of commitment to evolving and
				transforming society as a whole.</p>
				<p>Many feminists in fact consider the
				ritual setting and experience to serve as
				a visionary mode. In feminist rituals
				which utilize peyote, a good portion of
				the night-long ceremony is given over
				to envisioning the future of the self,
				the group and the world. In authentic
				ritual experience something, an ability
				to break through the present, is availble which can lead to discovery and
				creativity. Ritual is a potent source of
				invention because the participants feel
				the extreme intensity, sometimes the
				ecstasy, of openness to possibility and
				revelation. This sense of extreme openness and creativity is rare for women
				who have been traditionally circumscribed by severe limitation, constrained
			</p>
			<p>
				by custom, with no hope for a
				changed future.</p>
				<p>Another important consideration is
				the way feminist ritual purposefully imparts information of a special kind,
				information which has been unavailable to women and actually suppressed
				for hundreds of years. I refer specifically to the ritual communication of
				feminine images, primarily the communication of images of the goddesses
				The suppression of the goddess in
				our culture has meant the loss of
				images which identify personal and
				collective power in women. Invocations to the goddesses, references to

				their attributes, a reclamation of the
				wealth of literature which remains to
				describe them, the putting on of their
				symbols—none of these ritual actions
				indicates a desire to return to a golden
				matriarchal age as some critics have
				suggested. It is much more crucial for
				feminists, for all women, to uncover
				and recover their imagistic heritage (as
				represented in the powers and tales of
				the goddesses) and to create new images which represent women's recent
				emergence (as many women in the
				plastic and performing arts are now
				doing) than it is to prove the absolute
				historical existence of a widespread
				matriarchy. I have no doubt that some
				matriarchies did exist. The important
				consideration, however, is not the fact
				that women ruled over men but that
				they "ruled" themselves and that they
				had culturally approved or at least
				culturally active models for distinguishing their powers from others. In
				many ancient civilizations the feminine world was not as anomalous'
				as it currently is. Women had access
				to powerful images and used them to
				order and maintain their particular
				spheres of life.</p>
				<p>One of the most important shrines
				in the pre-Conquest Mayan world wa
				located on Cozumel Island twenty
				miles off the coast of the Yucatan.
				It was dedicated to IxChel, the preeminent goddess of the moon, water,
				childbirth, weaving and love, who was
				equal in status to the great father god,
				Itzamma. Her shrine was visited by
			</p>
         	<figure></figure>
			<p>
				women from all over the Mayan world,
				some traveling hundreds of miles from
				Guatemala and El Salvador. Inside the
				shrine a giant image of the goddess
				served as an oracle for these women
				pilgrims. The statue was hollowed out in
				back; a priestess would stand in that profound cavity and impersonate the goddess, become a speaking image of the
				goddess and in fact imagine herself the
			</p>
			<p>
				goddess. To imagine is to make an
				image or become an image; impersonation of this sort was an achievement of
				relation with the goddess and a means
				of absorbing her powers. Images are
				sources of identification; they tell us
				who we most profoundly, most archetypally are. The Mayan women who visited the shrine at Cozumel were seeking affirmation of their own powers
				(primarily the power to give birth, to be
				fruitful) and they received it through
				the pilgrimage itself (the association
				with peers), idol worship (intense identification with an image) through the
				blessing bestowed by the personified
				goddess, the priestess.</p>
				<p>Much the same identification is
				sought and achieved in feminist rituals.
				Ritual is a special vehicle of communication for feminists; ritual speaks a
				visceral language of restoration of symbols and provides an opportunity to
				utilize them personally. Sherry Ortner
				says that "Efforts directed solely at
				changing the social institutions cannot
				have far-reaching effects if cultural
				language and imagery continue to purvey a relatively devalued view of women."<note>19. Sherry Ortner, "Is Female to Male as
					Nature Is to Culture?", in Woman,
					Culture and Society, p. 87.</note> The imagery conveyed woman
				to-woman in ritual experience is imagery
				that upholds the value of women and
				symbolizes the varied kinds of thein
				power. If, as Vogt maintains, "Ritual
				perpetuates knowledge essential to the
				survival of the culture,"<note>20. Vogt, p. 8.</note> women are
				just now learning how important it is to
				their survival to store and transmit feminine knowledge through ritual means.</p>
				<p>Much of the available data on women's rituals reveal the prominence of
				one individual as instigator or leader of
				the ritual. This is not always the case as
				many rituals are performed without a
				leader, including rituals which follow
				a format and are repeated the same
				way every time, rituals which rely on
				group spontaneity, group meditation or
				chanting, etc. Nevertheless, a numbe
				of women in the feminist community
				have emerged as ritualists, the counterpart to the shaman in traditional societies. Most women involved in introducing ritual performance, however,
				do not call themselves shamans or
				think of themselves as such; they are
				most widely known simply as ritualists
				(or practitioners or witches if they adhere solely to the witchcraft tradition).
				The comparison between shamans and
				feminist ritualists is instructive only in
				demonstrating that their goals in performance are similar and, to a certain
				extent, their conception of self is analogous.</p>
         	<p>If the ultimate goal of ritual experience
			</p>
         	<figure></figure>
			<p>
				is to effect transformation (i.e., to
				change the order of things), in most
				cases someone must prepare the group
				to undergo change. A procedure must
				be decided upon (in traditional societies, custom determines procedure)
				and followed correctly to lead the participants from one state of feeling to
				another. Both the shaman and feminist
				ritualist make preparations and later
				facilitate the group's progress in the
				actual ritual; both are capable of helping transformation to take place if the
				participants will trust them. I am stressing here the fact that both shaman and
				feminist ritualist express a powerful
				sense of capability, that they can serve
				as links, as surrogates, that they can
				connect different realms of reality and
				facilitaté change by embodying change.
				Both roles are played by individuals
				who have changed and are concerned
				with enabling the change of others.
				Eliade says of the shaman: "He is,
				above all, a sick man who has been
				cured, who has succeeded in curing
				himself."<note>21. Eliade, p. 27.</note> The feminist ritualist is also
				one who has been "sick” in the sense
				that oppression makes one feel sick.
				She who is now cured of the tyranny of
				oppression offers that new sense of
				well- being to others. A traditional
				shaman may become a "professional
				transformer” practicing his art as occupation whereas a feminist ritualist
				may rise to the occasion of transformation only once in her lifetime (although
				many ritualists practice somewhat regularly). Still, the necessity of their individual acceptance of their power to
				change is crucial to the ultimate effect
				of the ritual</p>
				<p>An obvious similarity between the
				traditional shaman and the feminist
				ritualist is that both do their work
				through performing (singing, dancing,
				displaying, holding, hugging) and,
				moreover, the performance is quite
				often geared to awakening and stimulating the participant's body. For both
			</p>
			<pb n='25'/>
			<p>
				ritualist and shaman see the body, not
				the mind, as the locus of transformation. The body is our first and last outward reality; it defines and conditions
				our life experience and gives us personal identity and continuity. Both
				shaman and ritualist take the body to
				be the clearest, purest expression of
				self. And it is that aspect of self which
				must feel change before the intellectual
				or soul self can change. A chant l used
				in a ritual performance called Seeing
				the Voice expresses the bodily concerns
				of the transformer:</p>
         	<lg><l>My hands</l>
<l>Open the curtains of your being</l>				
					<l>Clothe you in a further nudity</l>
				<l>Uncover the bodies of your body</l>
				<l>My hands</l>
         		<l>Invent another body foryour body<note>22. Octavio Paz, “Touch," in Configurations
         			(New York: New Directions, 1971), p. 63.</note></l></lg>
				<p>The body is also recognized by both,
				especially by the ritualist as the means
				for making conscious interconnections
				and unions that were unconscious or
				suppressed. Ritual, through those who
				perform it, creates a new body, one
				body made of many, through which
				can be understood and realized the
				extremes of fear and love, the truly
				political dimensions of humanness.</p>
				<p>Finally, the relation between the
				shaman and his participant community
				and the parallel relation between the
				feminist ritualist and her participant
				community bears notation. Richard
				Schechner maintains that “the deep
				structure of shamanistic performance
				is a protagonist-antagonist conflict by
				means of which the secret wishes of the
				community are exposed and redistributed....The Shaman is the vessel
				through which all that is powerful
				chooses to express itself. And these
				powers are inherent in community
				itself, are the community."<note>23. Richard Schechner, Environmental
					Theater (New York: Hawthorne Books,
					1973), pp. 189-190.</note> Thus
				both shaman and ritualist exist primarily within a community and the
				powers they exemplity ultimately belong not to them as individuals but to
				the community which is the actual
				source of their power. The work of both
				the shaman and the ritualist is to make
				available, clarify and intensify powers
				that are the essence of community.
				Transformation is useless in isolation.</p>
				<p>A different comparison might be
				drawn between the artist and the ritualist. Here two items seem important
				(1) feminist ritual has some of its deepest roots in the art of the 1960s and 70s
				which gave rise to ritual-like forms
				such as the happening and (2) some
				feminist ritualists have come to ritua
				performance as a direct result of their
			</p>
			<p>
				previous interest in manipulating symbolic forms in other media (painting,
				sculpture, film, etc.).</p>
				<p>said earlier that a primary objective
				of ritual is to achieve shared meanings
				and a sense of shared goals, not to promote private images or dreams. This is
				the crucial difference between the ritualist and the artist. The artist takes
				herself, her content and ability to express that content as commendable to
				the world of meaning and aesthetics.
				She is a source of new meaning, novelty acting as a basis for determining accomplishment. The ritualist is constantly
			</p>
         	<figure></figure>
			<p>
				at work to leave the self, to become
				a channel for transcendent experience.
				Gathering the group members, nourishing their need for each other and themselves through the manipulation of
				dramatic forms — these are her aims. As
				Donna Henes once told me in a personal communication, "Making art
				locks me in myself, making rituals sets
				me free. I don’t want to make art
				anymore. The ritualist occupies a
				unique space between individual and
				group, between self-expression and
				group cohesion. She is the exemplary
				médiatrix, simultaneously the weaver
				and the process of weaving. A quote
				from Octavio Paz, though not written
				with the ritualist in mind, helps to define
				the sense she has of herself:</p>
				<quote>I am the other when I am myself, my acts
				are more my own when they are everybody's.
				Because to be myself I must be
				other, go out of myself, seek myself
				among others, those others who are not
				if I do not exist.<note>24. Paz, p. 63.</note></quote>
				<p>This dynamic of self loss and group
				gain are epitomized as the ritualist's
				view of her role is crucial to the transfer of power which the ritual mode
				promises. The ritualist defines her
				sense of powerfulness by her capacity
				to share it with others while the artist
			</p>
			<p>
				is concerned with obtaining power
				(through manipulation of media) and
				maintaining it for others to observe or
				partake of vicariously.</p>
				<p>In stressing the communal nature of
				the ritual experience, it may appear
				that the concept of the self and its nurturance are served by some means
				other than ritual. As the examples given
				earlier indicate, some feminist rituals
				are performed solely for the purpose of
				self-revelation. From its inception the
				women’s movement has insisted on the
				importance of realizing the way in
				which political change comes out of reinterpretation and reinvention of the
				personal dimension (the personal is
				political). All women have suffered the
				loss of affirmative, positive self-images
				as a direct result of their second-class
				status and consequent objectification
				in the male-dominant society. It is painful to consider the countless lives wasted, the talents atrophied and the sickness suffered by women who were
				never allowed, least of all encouraged,
				to know themselves and take strength
				and happiness in that knowledge. Surely one of the most highly regarded uses
				of ritual in traditional societies is the
				curing of "soul loss" of one form or another. Twentieth-century, postindustrial, special-privileged American women
				are engaged in ritual practice for much
				the same reason, metaphorically speaking.</p>
				<p>For women, the ritual setting is often
				a place for naming individual powers
				and sharing the affirmation of those
				powers with the group or simply inter
				nalizing them through private ritual
				procedure. Ritual provides a mode for
				getting in touch with the self and staying in touch. Also, by definition, the
				ritual space and activity are sacred in
				the sense of representing the possibility
				of self-transformation. Part of the
				power and the fear experienced in ritual
				is the realization that one may change
				become ultimately different, as a result
				of the experience or that the experience
				may suddenly make recognizable
				change that has been slowly rising from
				the depths of personality and ideology
				Victor Turner states that “When a ritual
				does work...it can cause, in some
				cases real transformations of character
				and of social relationships."<note>25. Victor Turner, Dramas, Fields and Metaphors (Ithaca: Cornell University Press,
					1974), p. 56.</note> 1 would
				venture to say that many women have
				been profoundly affected and, in some
				cases, redirected through their experience in ritual. A lost self is recovered,
				nurtured and allowed to emerge fully
				named.</p>
				<p>Ritual facilitates transition for the
				participant in specific ways. As Turner
			</p>
			<pb n='26'/>
			<p>
				clearly states, "Practically all rituals of
				any length and complexity represent a
				passage from one position, constellation, or domain ot structure to another.”<note>26. Turner, p. 238.</note> This passage occurs in individual women most dramatically, and nos
				without fear, separation anxiety and
				trauma. Before women can enter new
				roles they must leave old roles behind
				roles that once provided the comforts
				of self-definition and reality structure
				Ritual participation can ease transition
				by rendering it in dramatic, metaphorical terms and providing a support
				group to encourage and enable the
				necessary catharsis to take place</p>
				<p>The transfer of values from one
				framework to another leaves a womar
				just as vulnerable, suspended between
				two life styles. It is a dangerous time fos
				the individual, one which requires the
				support of the feminist community anc
				the use of ritual to promote ease in the
				transfer. Women are realizing that this
				is a responsibility and a desire: to help
				other women cross boundaries in thein
				lives not as aggressive individuals,
				proving themselves, but as new members of a community who deserve the
				help and protection of those who have
				gone before. We have all been guarded
				and we must all become guardians. The
				ritual setting allows women to know
				the power of guarding and the comfort
				of being guarded in a space that does
				not demand immediate resolution of
				the passage crisis. The crisis period
				may continue through many phases of
				recognition, adjustment and readjustment, the assimilation of which will fall
				primarily on the individual. But the
				community has developed ritual means
				by which that transformation may be
				asserted and its painful aspects some
				what absorbed by a formal claim made
			</p>
			<p>
				on the individual —a claim that she is
				new, that she is one of many, that she is
				welcome</p>
				<p>For feminists, as for other practitioners of ritual, doing the ritual is more important than knowing the ritual. The
				eficacy of ritual is always in the acting
				of it, in becoming bodily involved with
				the elements, not in understanding the
				text of belief or ideology which may
				underlie it. The essence of ritual is in
				physical relationship, one woman to
				another (or one woman to herself) in
				the circle they have created for each
				other</p>
				<p>This article only begins the necessary
				process of defining and evaluating the
				emergence of ritual as an important
				component of the greater liberatior
				movement. To my knowledge, only
				Lucy Lippard's article in Chrysalis
				specifically deals with the meaning of
				ritual for feminists. No other theoretica
				material is available although movement media sources such as Woman-spirit, Lady-Unique-Inclination-of-the-Night and Quest have been documenting ritual practices among women
				since 1974. My sense of the importance
				of ritual for the feminist community
				comes out of an understanding of it
				historical importance for humanity
				Ritual marks the ultimate ideal of relationship between self and community
				the fusion of two distinct realities
				rather than separation.</p>

				<lb/>Comprend, we sweat out our rituals.
				<lb/>together. We change them, we're all
				<lb/>the time changing them! But they
				<lb/>body our sense of good! — Marge
				<lb/>Piercy, Woman at the Edge of Time
				<lb/>The body is the image relator. In ritu
				<lb/>al, we embody and activate images of
				<lb/>the archetypal, the eternal feminine,
				<lb/>the goddess. Images of power, of trans
				<lb/>formation, of harmony and of duality
				<lb/>One woman empowering another. The
				<lb/>crucial exchange of gifts. I cross the cir
				<lb/>cle to give you something; you cross
				<lb/>the circle to give her something. And so
				<lb/>on until we have all changed places.
				<lb/>Power held is powerless; power given is
				<lb/>power for all. In feminist ritual we main
				<lb/>tain a center of which we are all aware.
				<lb/>It is our collective heart which beat
				<lb/>there. We hold together, our center
				<lb/>endures. Even the most painful sep
				<lb/>aration, the dispersal which is feared
				<lb/>but necessary, cannot disconnect us
				<lb/>from that ritual circle. Once that circle
				<lb/>is created and affirmed, chaos is sub
				<lb/>dued. We survive. We thrive
				<lb/>Although some theoretical attention
				<lb/>has been given to the recent spiritual
				<lb/>awakening within the women’s move-
				<lb/>ment, very little writing has been direct
				<lb/>ed toward analysis of the use of ritual
				<lb/>by women. What do these ritual acts
				<lb/>mean to contemporary U.S. feministsi
				<lb/>And what is their significance in terms
				<lb/>of the women's movement?
				<lb/>Feminists are primarily at work re
				<lb/>vising the male-biased ideological
				<lb/>bases of culture; some are now en
				<lb/>gaged in the creation of rituals to pro
				<lb/>mote and sanction this serious turning
				<lb/>away from the old to the new. As in
				<lb/>traditional societies, feminist ritual
				<lb/>provides an emotional, descriptive,
				<lb/>intensified and sanctifying version of
				<lb/>emergent ideological systems. Femi
				<lb/>nist ritual offers an imagistic revitali
				<lb/>zation for women, participation in the
				<lb/>concrete, bodily expressive creation of
				<lb/>new images of the feminine which will
				<lb/>help alleviate the stress of a liminality.
				<lb/>The evaluation of culture by Michelle
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb/>Zimbalist Rosaldo in her theoretical
				<lb/>overview for Woman, Culture and Soci
				<lb/>ety serves as useful background mate
				<lb/>rial for answering why women have cre
				<lb/>ated rituals as an expression of the
				<lb/>need for revitalization and as an im
				<lb/>petus for political action. First, Rosaldo
				<lb/>establishes a model for interpreting the
				<lb/>difference in status between men and
				<lb/>women, a model based on extensive
				<lb/>contemporary cross-cultural analysis
				<lb/>of male/female roles and behavior
				<lb/>She states that "an asymmetry in the
				<lb/>cultural evaluations of male and fe
				<lb/>male, in the importance assigned to
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb/>women and men, appears to be uni
				<lb/>versal.”' This asymmetry is manifested
				<lb/>the fact that male, as opposed to female,
				<lb/>activities are always recognized as pre
				<lb/>dominantly important, and cultural sys
				<lb/>tems give authority and value to the roles
				<lb/>and activities of men. ...Everywhere
				<lb/>from those societies we might want to
				<lb/>call most egalitarian to those in which
				<lb/>sexual stratification is most marked,
				<lb/>men are the locus of cultural value.
				<lb/>Over the past few thousand years
				<lb/>women have not been culturally grant
				<lb/>ed a legitimate, overt way of demon
				<lb/>strating their power, their personhood.
				<lb/>Only men define, possess and confer
				<lb/>power or authority, and power is the
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb/>necessary ingredient for the creation of
				<lb/>culture. Women are therefore con
				<lb/>signed to live on the fringes of culture,
				<lb/>locked in domestic zones which are
				<lb/>rarely defined as part of the cultural
				<lb/>territory. Rosaldo elaborates this point
				<lb/>by using Mary Douglas’s notion of “the
				<lb/>anomalous."
				<lb/>Recent studies of symbolic culture have
				<lb/>suggested that whatever violates a soci
				<lb/>ety’s sense of order will be seen as threat
				<lb/>ening, nasty, disorderly, orwrong. Douglas
				<lb/>has called this sort of thing"anomalous.
				<lb/>The idea of "order" depends, logically
				<lb/>on "disorder” as its opposite, yet society
				<lb/>tries to set such things aside. Insofar
				<lb/>as men. . define the public order wom
				<lb/>en are their opposite. Where men are
				<lb/>classified in terms of ranked, institution
				<lb/>al positions, women are simply women
				<lb/>and their activities, interests and dif
				<lb/>ferences receive only idiosyncratic note.
				<lb/>Women are anomalies in most cultures
				<lb/>and have no cultural recourse for dem
				<lb/>onstrating the reality of female power
				<lb/>Female power is almost without excep
				<lb/>tion displayed covertly under the rubric
				<lb/>of influence or association with the
				<lb/>right man. But Rosaldo makes a unique
				<lb/>claim for the possible use women may
				<lb/>make of their anomalous or liminal po
				<lb/>sitions. Even though women's status is
				<lb/>lowest in those societies where there is
				<lb/>the greatest distinction between the
				<lb/>public and domestic realms and where
				<lb/>women are isolated from each other,
				<lb/>"their position is raised when they can
				<lb/>challenge those claims of male author
				<lb/>ity, either by taking on men’s roles or
				<lb/>by establishing social ties, by creating a
				<lb/>sense of rank, order, and value in a
				<lb/>world in which women prevail."* It is
				<lb/>also clear that historically women have
				<lb/>taken on very active roles in social sys
				<lb/>tems by "manipulating, elaborating, or
				<lb/>undermining” their domestic roles and
				<lb/>by stressing their differences from men.
				<lb/>In other words, by giving special atten
				<lb/>tion to their anomalous status, women
				<lb/>have been able "to take on powers
				<lb/>uniquely their own.”5 Especially per
				<lb/>tinent to our discussion, Rosaldo men
			</p>
			<pb n='21'/>
			<p>
				<lb/>tions the roles of nun, midwife, witch
				<lb/>and religious prostitute as making par
				<lb/>ticularly positive use of women's
				<lb/>"anomalous" sexuality. "These ex
				<lb/>amples suggest that the very symbolic
				<lb/>and social conceptions [the notions of
				<lb/>purity and pollution associated with
				<lb/>women) that appear to set women apart
				<lb/>and to circumscribe their activities may
				<lb/>be used by women as a basis for female
				<lb/>solidarity and worth."6
				<lb/>Of course it is most significant that
				<lb/>these roles include the classic examples
				<lb/>of women who have been allowed to
				<lb/>utilize ritual means as a source of gain
				<lb/>ing and transterring power. Men have
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb/>tenaciously held the rights to ritual
				<lb/>use since the suppression of the
				<lb/>ancient priestesses of the goddess. In
				<lb/>fact the participation in ritual by men
				<lb/>has been their most profound display
				<lb/>of cultural authority and their most
				<lb/>direct access to it. The performance
				<lb/>of ritual in most societies, "primitive'
				<lb/>and "civilized," is a simultaneous ack
				<lb/>nowledgment of men's warrant to
				<lb/>create and define culture and, by ex
				<lb/>clusion, a sign to women to keep in
				<lb/>their place, a place which we have al-
				<lb/>ready designated as outside culture
				<lb/>and without the symbolic or real attri
				<lb/>butes of power.
				<lb/>Here we see a further distinction be
				<lb/>tween the sacred and the profane
				<lb/>based on the asymmetry of male-fe
				<lb/>male relationships. Men have claimed
				<lb/>sacred space as their locus for effect
				<lb/>ing control over and/or maintaining
				<lb/>harmony with each other and the fates.
				<lb/>As Mircea Eliade has shown, sacred
				<lb/>space is "manifested space,” it is cre
				<lb/>ated as sacred by men and in most so
				<lb/>cieties women have little or no access to
				<lb/>it.” Women live in the profane world,
				<lb/>the world that is, the world that is in
				<lb/>capable of being transformed or of
				<lb/>transforming those who live in it. Of
				<lb/>course men live in the profane world
				<lb/>too (in fact we all live there most of the
				<lb/>time), but when they choose to do so
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb/>(or when the "gods" command them to
				<lb/>do so) they may enter another world, a
				<lb/>world of the sacred, and through ritual
				<lb/>practice they may take part in ordering
				<lb/>that world and themselves. The sacred
				<lb/>realm is that of being and becoming, a
				<lb/>realm saturated with power and critical
				<lb/>ly "off-limits" to the female half of the
				<lb/>human species.
				<lb/>That women in the United-States and
				<lb/>elsewhere have begun to claim sacred
				<lb/>space for themselves, to create rituals
				<lb/>which emphasize their loyalty to each
				<lb/>other and finally name the powers
				<lb/>which men have found "anomalous”
				<lb/>(i.e., nameless) is indeed an ultimate,
				<lb/>radical (proceeding from the root) affir
				<lb/>mation of the revolutionary potential
				<lb/>of the feminist movement. Ässerting
				<lb/>the right to ritual means as a source of
				<lb/>power, vision and solidarity is the sym
				<lb/>bolic corollary of equal pay, choice of
				<lb/>abortion, domestic freedom, the estab
				<lb/>lishment of women’s businesses, etc.
				<lb/>Successful and enduring change in the
				<lb/>status of women will come only through
				<lb/>the parallel transformation of symbols
				<lb/>and realities. Feminist ritual practice is
				<lb/>currently the most important model for
				<lb/>symbolic and, therefore, psychic and
				<lb/>spiritual change in women
				<lb/>Here I would like to describe briefly
				<lb/>a number of feminist rituals which
				<lb/>characterize the kind and variety of ex
				<lb/>pression this form has taken.
				<lb/>In her Spotted Bundle Enclosures
				<lb/>Jody Pinto digs out old brick wells
				<lb/>outside Philadelphia. At the bottom of
				<lb/>these wells she leaves personal and
				<lb/>found objects wrapped in animal skins.
				<lb/>Next to these bundles Pinto makes a
				<lb/>primitive fireplace with shards and
				<lb/>cooking utensils. She constructs a lad
				<lb/>der and leaves it down the side of the
				<lb/>well as an invitation for others to come
				<lb/>in. Reflecting on the creation of these
				<lb/>ritual sites and her activity in them,
				<lb/>Pinto writes, “The other day I spread
				<lb/>wings/split a man in half/spent a year in
				<lb/>the earth/excavated my own tomb
				<lb/>rolled over/cut out my heart/and ate
				<lb/>Donna Henes’s Spider Woman Series
				<lb/>involves web-building in natural and
				<lb/>urban environments. Henes defines
				<lb/>web-making as the "most basic female
				<lb/>instinct" and has made a personal ritu
				<lb/>al of web-making over the past three
				<lb/>years.
				<lb/>Margi Gumpert, a witch by trade and
				<lb/>by faith, performs a specific ritual
				<lb/>whenever she enters a public bathroom.
				<lb/>often notice that the mirror reflects an
				<lb/>image which makes me question myselt,
				<lb/>feel critical or dissatisfied with my ap
				<lb/>pearance. I don’t ignore it as trivial,
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb/>because I recognize that the mirror is
				<lb/>infested with a very common political
				<lb/>poison, virus hollywoodius or television
				<lb/>iensis, subtle pressure to measure up to a
				<lb/>pattern designed to enslave. Just to free
				<lb/>myself of that pressure isn’t a magical
				<lb/>operation. But hundreds of other women
				<lb/>will use that mirror. So after I have
				<lb/>cleared my own image of that false
				<lb/>cloud, I usually perform some sort of
				<lb/>magical activity to neutralize the poison.
				<lb/>pour suggestive energy into the mirror,
				<lb/>encouraging anyone who might look in it
				<lb/>to see herself in her true beauty. I rein
				<lb/>force the suggestion with all the power
				<lb/>of my will and call on the Goddess of
				<lb/>Beauty Herself, blessed Aphrodite, to
				<lb/>banish that which would deny Her, as
				<lb/>She exists in all of I
				<lb/>A ritual for the Autumn Equinox is
				<lb/>performed yearly by a group of women
				<lb/>living in the country near Wolf Creek,
				<lb/>Oregon
				<lb/>Let friends gather, each bringing with her
				<lb/>an article which represents a recent
				<lb/>accomplishment— some self-chosen task
				<lb/>she has completed. Let a circle form and
				<lb/>each one place her article in front of her,
				<lb/>and next to it a fruit, seed or cone. Join
				<lb/>hands and chant in unison the names of
				<lb/>all present—several times till the energy
				<lb/>is high. Then pause and chant the months
				<lb/>of the year from the Winter Solstice to
				<lb/>the Autumn Equinox.
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb/>Now let each one in turn hold her article
				<lb/>while she tells her friends of her accom
				<lb/>plishment and something she has learned
				<lb/>from it. When all have spoken all shall
				<lb/>pick up the fruit, seed or cone in front of
				<lb/>them and picture inwardly the process of
				<lb/>its change from seed to plant to flower
				<lb/>to seed.
				<lb/>Again let each woman speak in turn of
				<lb/>what her accomplishment has meant to
				<lb/>her growth and how she thinks it may be
				<lb/>useful to her self and others. At this
				<lb/>time if she feels grateful, let her give
				<lb/>thanks. If she wants to dance, let her
				<lb/>move. When all have expressed their
				<lb/>feeling, with closed eyes ask yourself
				<lb/>"What is the next stage in the process of
				<lb/>my growth?” Ask your inner self for
				<lb/>energy and guidance to continue.

				<lb/>Let all join hands, moving closer into a
				<lb/>hugging circle and repeat:
				<lb/>After the joy of harvest
				<lb/>After the work of the day
				<lb/>After the time of fulfillment
				<lb/>Comes the time of rest.
				<lb/>After the seed is planted
				<lb/>Nature takes care of the rest.1
				<lb/>On the streets of downtown Boston a
				<lb/>woman wearing a high feather head
				<lb/>dress makes a circle of cornmeal,
				<lb/>places three ears of corn in the center
				<lb/>of the circle and begins a rhythmic
				<lb/>chant naming the goddesses of the
				<lb/>Americas before the conquest (Tonant
				<lb/>zin, Chicomecoaltl, Blue Corn Girl,
				<lb/>IxChel, etc.) After the chant is finished,
				<lb/>she calls on women passing by, invites
				<lb/>them into the circle and blesses them
				<lb/>by saying in litany form an ancient Az
				<lb/>tec poem from the Poesia Nahautl:
				<lb/>Now o friends
				<lb/>Listen to the words of a dream
				<lb/>Each spring brings us new life
				<lb/>The golden corn refreshes us
				<lb/>And the pink corn makes us a necklace
				<lb/>At least this we know:
				<lb/>The hearts of our friends are true.
				<lb/>While the women alternate in speaking
				<lb/>the lines of the poem to each other,
				<lb/>they hold an ear of corn between them
				<lb/>and tear the sheaves down exposing the
				<lb/>fresh corn. This ritual has been per
				<lb/>formed from coast to coast with at
				<lb/>least 300 women receiving the blessing
				<lb/>since it was first done in 1975.12
				<lb/>In northern California several wom
				<lb/>en have constructed menstrual huts as
				<lb/>ritual retreats where they can go during
				<lb/>their monthly periods. Painting the red
				<lb/>quarter moon on their foreheads as a
				<lb/>symbol of their special condition, they
				<lb/>use the time spent in the hut for experi
				<lb/>encing and affirming the culmination
				<lb/>of cyclic process. It is a time for medi
				<lb/>tation and separation, but separation
				<lb/>without the patriarchal connotations of
				<lb/>impurity, defilement and unworthiness.
				<lb/>The menstrual flow is equated with the
				<lb/>particular power of the feminine and
				<lb/>time spent apart in the hut is for per
				<lb/>sonally determining the course of that
				<lb/>power."
				<lb/>The following ritual was recounted
				<lb/>in Sundance, a journal devoted to the
				<lb/>study and sharing of dreams.
				<lb/>In a past issue of Womanspirit there is an
				<lb/>article by Hallie Mountainwing describ
				<lb/>ing an overnight wilderness event attend
				<lb/>ed by twelve women. The purpose of
				<lb/>the venture was to share dreams, be
				<lb/>come deeper friends and explore the
				<lb/>meaning to each of them of being wom
				<lb/>en. To prepare for dreaming together,
				<lb/>the twelve women arranged their sleep
				<lb/>ing bags into a "wheel” surrounding a
				<lb/>central pole. In addition, each woman
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb/>had two strands of ribbon attached to
				<lb/>her sleeping bag which were then at
				<lb/>tached to the pole, making a "dream
				<lb/>net." The arrangement is quite similar to
				<lb/>the May Pole and Sun Dance ceremonies,
				<lb/>except, in this case, the people are lying
				<lb/>down, asleep and dreaming. As an ap
				<lb/>proximation to a contemporary experi
				<lb/>ment in revelation, a twelve-person
				<lb/>"dream wheel” inspires continued ex
				<lb/>ploration."
				<lb/>By way of contrast and comparison,
				<lb/>want to present a woman's ritual
				<lb/>which has been practiced on the
				<lb/>Yucatan Peninsula for centuries. A
				<lb/>form of this ritual is still performed
				<lb/>today but the following account was
				<lb/>recorded in 1930 by Basauri and trans
				<lb/>lated by J. Eric Thompson in his “The
				<lb/>Moon Goddess in Central America."
				<lb/>The ceremony is called “the song of
				<lb/>the roses," KAIK' MIKTE.
				<lb/>A hollow is made in a level place and
				<lb/>filled with water. This hollow should be
				<lb/>of sufficient size so that a woman may
				<lb/>take a bath in it. The woman, who hopes
				<lb/>to benefit from the ceremony is placed
				<lb/>in it completely naked. Once she is in
				<lb/>and the liquid reaches to the height of
				<lb/>her breasts, they [other women who par
				<lb/>ticipate in the ceremony) cover the sur
				<lb/>face with flowers. Several women, friends
				<lb/>of the one to be benefited, the numben
				<lb/>of which may vary, but never falls below
				<lb/>five, take hands and dance around the
				<lb/>bather, some singing and others saying a
				<lb/>prayer in Maya. The dance lasts an hour
				<lb/>and during that time the dancers take
				<lb/>flowers which they have already pre
				<lb/>pared, stoop down to moisten them in
				<lb/>the water in which the principal bathes,
				<lb/>and throw them on the breast of the
				<lb/>woman making the ceremony (la soli-
				<lb/>citante). During the dance it is the cus
				<lb/>tom to make nine turns in one direction,
				<lb/>stop a moment to moisten the flowers,
				<lb/>and then repeat the same number of
				<lb/>turns in the opposite direction. When the
				<lb/>ceremony is ended, the dancers retire,
				<lb/>the woman remains alone in the water,
				<lb/>and, on coming out, she takes a quantity
				<lb/>of it, which she carries with her to em
				<lb/>ploy in the preparation of her husband's
				<lb/>or lover's food."
				<lb/>Although the ritual is ostensibly
				<lb/>practiced to make their lovers remain
				<lb/>faithful, the beauty of the ceremony
				<lb/>lies in its kinship with all ritual acts,
				<lb/>both past and present, which describe
				<lb/>the healing, nurturing effect of tribal
				<lb/>sisterhood. The overt goal of the ritual
				<lb/>is not the only reason for performing it;
				<lb/>something significant is taking place in
				<lb/>the act of perfórmance too. An in
				<lb/>dividual woman is uplifted and sac
				<lb/>ralized by her sisters, her comadres,
				<lb/>her C-R group, her kind.
				<lb/>The above presentation of wom
				<lb/>an’s rituals is by no means exhaustive.
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb/>In fact thę range of expressive mate
				<lb/>rial in current feminist ritual sets is so
				<lb/>diverse, multivocal and widespread
				<lb/>that one of the major tasks of the his
				<lb/>torical branch of the women's move
				<lb/>ment must be to document the growth
				<lb/>of ritual events. Someone must also
				<lb/>take on the project of assembling what
				<lb/>cross-cultural historical evidence exists
				<lb/>of women’s rituals such as the KAIK
				<lb/>MIKTE
				<lb/>In “The Qualitative Leap Beyond
				<lb/>Patriarchal Religion," theologian Mary
				<lb/>Daly makes the following statement:
				<lb/>The Women’s revolution is not merely
				<lb/>about equality within a patriarchal soci
				<lb/>ety (a contradiction in terms). It is about
				<lb/>power and redefining power. Within
				<lb/>patriarchy, power is generally under
				<lb/>stood as power over people, the environ
				<lb/>ment, things. In the rising consciousness
				<lb/>of women, power is experienced as
				<lb/>power of presence to ourselves and to
				<lb/>each other, as we affirm our own being
				<lb/>against and beyond the alienated iden
				<lb/>tity bestowed upon us within the patri-
				<lb/>archy. This is experienced as power of
				<lb/>absence by those who would objectify
				<lb/>women as ’the other, as magnifying
				<lb/>mirrors.1
				<lb/>Daly’s insistence that redefinition of
				<lb/>power is a central goal of the women's
				<lb/>movement is crucial for understanding
				<lb/>the use of ritual by feminists, a sym
				<lb/>bolic model for discovering how to give
				<lb/>and get."power of presence." One
				<lb/>woman empowers another (or herself)
				<lb/>through reaffirmation of the body as an
				<lb/>instrument of communion (not aliena
				<lb/>tion).
				<lb/>None of the rituals mentioned above
				<lb/>would be considered effective if a
				<lb/>transfer of power had not resulted. Yet
				<lb/>it is of critical importance to note that
				<lb/>power is rarely considered an object of
				<lb/>possession which the group or individu
				<lb/>al may get hold of during ritual activity.
				<lb/>What is stressed through ritual is the
				<lb/>dynamic quality of power, the continu
				<lb/>al exchange of gifts which heightens
				<lb/>the affirmative identity of all who par
				<lb/>ticipate. Power emanates from within
				<lb/>as it is simultaneously received from
				<lb/>without. For women in revolution it is
				<lb/>imperative to create an entirely new
				<lb/>value system, the heart of which will be
				<lb/>a dramatic reassessment of the use of
				<lb/>power. Ritual serves as a primary way
				<lb/>of affirming commitment to that re
				<lb/>assessment. The ritual setting provides
				<lb/>a place for knowing the easy, direct
				<lb/>exchange and sharing of power. Cer
				<lb/>tainly ritual is an idealized microcos
				<lb/>mic experience, but it may be an en
				<lb/>durably important means of invoking a
				<lb/>new order of things in the macrocosm.
				<lb/>At the very least it has been a useful
			</p>
			<pb n='23'/>
			<p>
				<lb/>mode for envisioning what a different
				<lb/>world for women might feel like.
				<lb/>The word "feeling” deserves special
				<lb/>mention in connection with women's
				<lb/>rituals. In fact it is a word we must
				<lb/>never neglect in talking about any ritu
				<lb/>al. Evon Vogt once asked a ritual par
				<lb/>ticipant, "Why do you go through the
				<lb/>ceremonies? Why do you do what you
				<lb/>do?" The participant replied, “To fee
				<lb/>better, I want to make myself feel bet
				<lb/>ter."" In the context of ritual women
				<lb/>are creating a space in which to feel
				<lb/>better, to feel more, to feel the past as
				<lb/>well as the future. Perhaps most im
				<lb/>portant is the way in which ritual up-
				<lb/>holds and celebrates the validity of
				<lb/>feeling as a mode of revelation, com
				<lb/>munication and transvaluation. In
				<lb/>some of the rituals described above the
				<lb/>flow of feelings, change in feelings or
				<lb/>sharing of feelings with others is a high
				<lb/>ly desirable goal in performing the ritual.
				<lb/>In discussing the reasons underlying
				<lb/>the performance of ritual acts in the
				<lb/>feminist community, we must under
				<lb/>score the importance of ritual as a
				<lb/>formalized consecration of female
				<lb/>bonding. The ritual concretization of
				<lb/>the idea reflected in the popular fem
				<lb/>inist slogan "Sisterhood is Powerful" is
				<lb/>extremely important in demonstrating
				<lb/>the cohesiveness and commitment of
				<lb/>the feminist community. A primary
				<lb/>function of ritual is to connect the in
				<lb/>dividual with the group—dramatically,
				<lb/>indissoluably. In ritual the desire is to
				<lb/>achieve shared meanings, shared reso
				<lb/>lutions, shared emotion, not to pro
				<lb/>mote private images or dreams. The
				<lb/>specific rites which comprise many
				<lb/>feminist rituals reaffirm relationship,
				<lb/>belonging and identity. Ritual acts
				<lb/>maintain a symbolic center of which all
				<lb/>the participants are aware. This center
				<lb/>is a place to which one can return for
				<lb/>support and comfort long after the
				<lb/>ceremony has ended. A relational or
				<lb/>ideological bond cemented formally
				<lb/>through ritual procedure is nothing if
				<lb/>not enduring.
				<lb/>Being capable of membership in a
				<lb/>group and finding ways of expressing
				<lb/>that membership and acting it out are
				<lb/>necessary for the success of any polit
				<lb/>ical revolution. Let us not forget that
				<lb/>less than ten years ago Lionel Tiger told
				<lb/>us "women do not bond””? and in so
				<lb/>saying implied women are incapable
				<lb/>of creating significant political institu
				<lb/>tions. It is already evident that women
				<lb/>have effected widespread social
				<lb/>change (to enumerate the accomplish
				<lb/>ments to date would fill pages) since
				<lb/>the formal resumption of the feminist
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb/>movement in 1967. Ritual participation
				<lb/>will no doubt stimulate further and
				<lb/>deeper political change for there is, in
				<lb/>deed, a continuum between ritual and
				<lb/>everyday life for feminists. The female
				<lb/>bonds established in ritual lend in
				<lb/>centive to the female bonds that in
				<lb/>spire social change. The use of ritual
				<lb/>is significant as a source for the re
				<lb/>newal of commitment to evolving and
				<lb/>transforming society as a whole.
				<lb/>Many feminists in fact consider the
				<lb/>ritual setting and experience to serve as
				<lb/>a visionary mode. In feminist rituals
				<lb/>which utilize peyote, a good portion of
				<lb/>the night-long ceremony is given over
				<lb/>to envisioning the future of the self,
				<lb/>the group and the world. In authentic
				<lb/>ritual experience something, an ability
				<lb/>to break through the present, is avail
				<lb/>able which can lead to discovery and
				<lb/>creativity. Ritual is a potent source of
				<lb/>invention because the participants feel
				<lb/>the extreme intensity, sometimes the
				<lb/>ecstasy, of openness to possibility and
				<lb/>revelation. This sense of extreme open
				<lb/>ness and creativity is rare for women
				<lb/>who have been traditionally circum
				<lb/>scribed by severe limitation, con
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb/>strained by custom, with no hope for a
				<lb/>changed future.
				<lb/>Another important consideration is
				<lb/>the way feminist ritual purposefully im
				<lb/>parts information of a special kind,
				<lb/>information which has been unavail
				<lb/>able to women and actually suppressed
				<lb/>for hundreds of years. I refer specif
				<lb/>ically to the ritual communication of
				<lb/>feminine images, primarily the commu
				<lb/>nication of images of the goddesses
				<lb/>The suppression of the goddess in
				<lb/>our culture has meant the loss of
				<lb/>images which identify personal and
				<lb/>collective power in women. Invoca-
				<lb/>tions to the goddesses, references to
			</p>
			<pb n='24'/>
			<p>
				<lb/>their attributes, a reclamation of the
				<lb/>wealth of literature which remains to
				<lb/>describe them, the putting on of their
				<lb/>symbols—none of these ritual actions
				<lb/>indicates a desire to return to a golden
				<lb/>matriarchal age as some critics have
				<lb/>suggested. It is much more crucial for
				<lb/>feminists, for all women, to uncover
				<lb/>and recover their imagistic heritage (as
				<lb/>represented in the powers and tales of
				<lb/>the goddesses) and to create new im
				<lb/>ages which represent women's recent
				<lb/>emergence (as many women in the
				<lb/>plastic and performing arts are now
				<lb/>doing) than it is to prove the absolute
				<lb/>historical existence of a widespread
				<lb/>matriarchy. I have no doubt that some
				<lb/>matriarchies did exist. The important
				<lb/>consideration, however, is not the fact
				<lb/>that women ruled over men but that
				<lb/>they "ruled" themselves and that they
				<lb/>had culturally approved or at least
				<lb/>culturally active models for distin
				<lb/>guishing their powers from others. In
				<lb/>many ancient civilizations the fem
				<lb/>inine world was not as anomalous'
				<lb/>as it currently is. Women had access
				<lb/>to powerful images and used them to
				<lb/>order and maintain their particular
				<lb/>spheres of life.
				<lb/>One of the most important shrines
				<lb/>in the pre-Conquest Mayan world wa
				<lb/>located on Cozumel Island twenty
				<lb/>miles off the coast of the Yucatan.
				<lb/>It was dedicated to IxChel, the pre
				<lb/>eminent goddess of the moon, water,
				<lb/>childbirth, weaving and love, who was
				<lb/>equal in status to the great father god,
				<lb/>Itzamma. Her shrine was visited by
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb/>women from all over the Mayan world,
				<lb/>some traveling hundreds of miles from
				<lb/>Guatemala and El Salvador. Inside the
				<lb/>shrine a giant image of the goddess
				<lb/>served as an oracle for these women
				<lb/>pilgrims. The statue was hollowed out in
				<lb/>back; a priestess would stand in that pro
				<lb/>found cavity and impersonate the god
				<lb/>dess, become a speaking image of the
				<lb/>goddess and in fact imagine herself the
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb/>goddess. To imagine is to make an
				<lb/>image or become an image; impersona
				<lb/>tion of this sort was an achievement of
				<lb/>relation with the goddess and a means
				<lb/>of absorbing her powers. Images are
				<lb/>sources of identification; they tell us
				<lb/>who we most profoundly, most arche
				<lb/>typally are. The Mayan women who vis
				<lb/>ited the shrine at Cozumel were seek
				<lb/>ing affirmation of their own powers
				<lb/>(primarily the power to give birth, to be
				<lb/>fruitful) and they received it through
				<lb/>the pilgrimage itself (the association
				<lb/>with peers), idol worship (intense iden
				<lb/>tification with an image) through the
				<lb/>blessing bestowed by the personified
				<lb/>goddess, the priestess.
				<lb/>Much the same identification is
				<lb/>sought and achieved in feminist rituals.
				<lb/>Ritual is a special vehicle of commu
				<lb/>nication for feminists; ritual speaks a
				<lb/>visceral language of restoration of sym
				<lb/>bols and provides an opportunity to
				<lb/>utilize them personally. Sherry Ortner
				<lb/>says that "Efforts directed solely at
				<lb/>changing the social institutions cannot
				<lb/>have far-reaching effects if cultural
				<lb/>language and imagery continue to pur
				<lb/>vey a relatively devalued view of wom-
				<lb/>en."1° The imagery conveyed woman
				<lb/>to-woman in ritual experience is imagery
				<lb/>that upholds the value of women and
				<lb/>symbolizes the varied kinds of thein
				<lb/>power. If, as Vogt maintains, "Ritual
				<lb/>perpetuates knowledge essential to the
				<lb/>survival of the culture,"2° women are
				<lb/>just now learning how important it is to
				<lb/>their survival to store and transmit fem
				<lb/>inine knowledge through ritual means.
				<lb/>Much of the available data on wom
				<lb/>en's rituals reveal the prominence of
				<lb/>one individual as instigator or leader of
				<lb/>the ritual. This is not always the case as
				<lb/>many rituals are performed without a
				<lb/>leader, including rituals which follow
				<lb/>a format and are repeated the same
				<lb/>way every time, rituals which rely on
				<lb/>group spontaneity, group meditation or
				<lb/>chanting, etc. Nevertheless, a numbe
				<lb/>of women in the feminist community
				<lb/>have emerged as ritualists, the counter
				<lb/>part to the shaman in traditional soci
				<lb/>eties. Most women involved in intro
				<lb/>ducing ritual performance, however,
				<lb/>do not call themselves shamans or
				<lb/>think of themselves as such; they are
				<lb/>most widely known simply as ritualists
				<lb/>(or practitioners or witches if they ad
				<lb/>here solely to the witchcraft tradition).
				<lb/>The comparison between shamans and
				<lb/>feminist ritualists is instructive only in
				<lb/>demonstrating that their goals in per
				<lb/>formance are similar and, to a certain
				<lb/>extent, their conception of self is anal
				<lb/>ogous.
				<lb/>If the ultimate goal of ritual experi
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb/>ence is to effect transformation (i.e., to
				<lb/>change the order of things), in most
				<lb/>cases someone must prepare the group
				<lb/>to undergo change. A procedure must
				<lb/>be decided upon (in traditional soci
				<lb/>eties, custom determines procedure)
				<lb/>and followed correctly to lead the par
				<lb/>ticipants from one state of feeling to
				<lb/>another. Both the shaman and feminist
				<lb/>ritualist make preparations and later
				<lb/>facilitate the group's progress in the
				<lb/>actual ritual; both are capable of help
				<lb/>ing transformation to take place if the
				<lb/>participants will trust them. I am stress
				<lb/>ing here the fact that both shaman and
				<lb/>feminist ritualist express a powerful
				<lb/>sense of capability, that they can serve
				<lb/>as links, as surrogates, that they can
				<lb/>connect different realms of reality and
				<lb/>facilitaté change by embodying change.
				<lb/>Both roles are played by individuals
				<lb/>who have changed and are concerned
				<lb/>with enabling the change of others.
				<lb/>Eliade says of the shaman: "He is,
				<lb/>above all, a sick man who has been
				<lb/>cured, who has succeeded in curing
				<lb/>himself."2 The feminist ritualist is also
				<lb/>one who has been "sick” in the sense
				<lb/>that oppression makes one feel sick.
				<lb/>She who is now cured of the tyranny of
				<lb/>oppression offers that new sense of
				<lb/>well- being to others. A traditional
				<lb/>shaman may become a "professional
				<lb/>transformer” practicing his art as oc
				<lb/>cupation whereas a feminist ritualist
				<lb/>may rise to the occasion of transforma
				<lb/>tion only once in her lifetime (although
				<lb/>many ritualists practice somewhat reg
				<lb/>ularly). Still, the necessity of their in
				<lb/>dividual acceptance of their power to
				<lb/>change is crucial to the ultimate effect
				<lb/>of the ritual
				<lb/>An obvious similarity between the
				<lb/>traditional shaman and the feminist
				<lb/>ritualist is that both do their work
				<lb/>through performing (singing, dancing,
				<lb/>displaying, holding, hugging) and,
				<lb/>moreover, the performance is quite
				<lb/>often geared to awakening and stim
				<lb/>ulating the participant's body. For both
			</p>
			<pb n='25'/>
			<p>
				<lb/>ritualist and shaman see the body, not
				<lb/>the mind, as the locus of transforma
				<lb/>tion. The body is our first and last out
				<lb/>ward reality; it defines and conditions
				<lb/>our life experience and gives us per
				<lb/>sonal identity and continuity. Both
				<lb/>shaman and ritualist take the body to
				<lb/>be the clearest, purest expression of
				<lb/>self. And it is that aspect of self which
				<lb/>must feel change before the intellectual
				<lb/>or soul self can change. A chant l used
				<lb/>in a ritual performance called Seeing
				<lb/>the Voice expresses the bodily concerns
				<lb/>of the transformer:
				<lb/>My hands
				<lb/>Open the curtains of your being
				<lb/>Clothe you in a further nudity
				<lb/>Uncover the bodies of your body
				<lb/>My hands
				<lb/>Invent another body foryour body 22
				<lb/>The body is also recognized by both,
				<lb/>especially by the ritualist as the means
				<lb/>for making conscious interconnections
				<lb/>and unions that were unconscious or
				<lb/>suppressed. Ritual, through those who
				<lb/>perform it, creates a new body, one
				<lb/>body made of many, through which
				<lb/>can be understood and realized the
				<lb/>extremes of fear and love, the truly
				<lb/>political dimensions of humanness.
				<lb/>Finally, the relation between the
				<lb/>shaman and his participant community
				<lb/>and the parallel relation between the
				<lb/>feminist ritualist and her participant
				<lb/>community bears notation. Richard
				<lb/>Schechner maintains that “the deep
				<lb/>structure of shamanistic performance
				<lb/>is a protagonist-antagonist conflict by
				<lb/>means of which the secret wishes of the
				<lb/>community are exposed and redis
				<lb/>tributed....The Shaman is the vessel
				<lb/>through which all that is powerful
				<lb/>chooses to express itself. And these
				<lb/>powers are inherent in community
				<lb/>itself, are the community."23 Thus
				<lb/>both shaman and ritualist exist pri
				<lb/>marily within a community and the
				<lb/>powers they exemplity ultimately be
				<lb/>long not to them as individuals but to
				<lb/>the community which is the actual
				<lb/>source of their power. The work of both
				<lb/>the shaman and the ritualist is to make
				<lb/>available, clarify and intensify powers
				<lb/>that are the essence of community.
				<lb/>Transformation is useless in isolation.
				<lb/>A different comparison might be
				<lb/>drawn between the artist and the ritu
				<lb/>alist. Here two items seem important
				<lb/>(1) feminist ritual has some of its deep
				<lb/>est roots in the art of the 1960s and 70s
				<lb/>which gave rise to ritual-like forms
				<lb/>such as the happening and (2) some
				<lb/>feminist ritualists have come to ritua
				<lb/>performance as a direct result of their
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb/>previous interest in manipulating sym
				<lb/>bolic forms in other media (painting,
				<lb/>sculpture, film, etc.).
				<lb/>said earlier that a primary objective
				<lb/>of ritual is to achieve shared meanings
				<lb/>and a sense of shared goals, not to pro
				<lb/>mote private images or dreams. This is
				<lb/>the crucial difference between the rit
				<lb/>ualist and the artist. The artist takes
				<lb/>herself, her content and ability to ex
				<lb/>press that content as commendable to
				<lb/>the world of meaning and aesthetics.
				<lb/>She is a source of new meaning, novel
				<lb/>ty acting as a basis for determining ac
				<lb/>complishment. The ritualist is constant
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb/>ly at work to leave the self, to become
				<lb/>a channel for transcendent experience.
				<lb/>Gathering the group members, nourish
				<lb/>ing their need for each other and them
				<lb/>selves through the manipulation of
				<lb/>dramatic forms — these are her aims. As
				<lb/>Donna Henes once told me in a per
				<lb/>sonal communication, "Making art
				<lb/>locks me in myself, making rituals sets
				<lb/>me free. I don’t want to make art
				<lb/>anymore. The ritualist occupies a
				<lb/>unique space between individual and
				<lb/>group, between self-expression and
				<lb/>group cohesion. She is the exemplary
				<lb/>médiatrix, simultaneously the weaver
				<lb/>and the process of weaving. A quote
				<lb/>from Octavio Paz, though not written
				<lb/>with the ritualist in mind, helps to define
				<lb/>the sense she has of herself:
				<lb/>am the other when I am myself, my acts
				<lb/>are more my own when they are every-
				<lb/>body’s. Because to be myself I must be
				<lb/>other, go out of myself, seek myself
				<lb/>among others, those others who are not
				<lb/>if 1do not exist.2
				<lb/>This dynamic of self loss and group
				<lb/>gain are epitomized as the ritualist's
				<lb/>view of her role is crucial to the trans
				<lb/>fer of power which the ritual mode
				<lb/>promises. The ritualist defines her
				<lb/>sense of powerfulness by her capacity
				<lb/>to share it with others while the artist
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb/>is concerned with obtaining power
				<lb/>(through manipulation of media) and
				<lb/>maintaining it for others to observe or
				<lb/>partake of vicariously.
				<lb/>In stressing the communal nature of
				<lb/>the ritual experience, it may appear
				<lb/>that the concept of the self and its nur
				<lb/>turance are served by some means
				<lb/>other than ritual. As the examples given
				<lb/>earlier indicate, some feminist rituals
				<lb/>are performed solely for the purpose of
				<lb/>self-revelation. From its inception the
				<lb/>women’s movement has insisted on the
				<lb/>importance of realizing the way in
				<lb/>which political change comes out of re
				<lb/>interpretation and reinvention of the
				<lb/>personal dimension (the personal is
				<lb/>political). All women have suffered the
				<lb/>loss of affirmative, positive self-images
				<lb/>as a direct result of their second-class
				<lb/>status and consequent objectification
				<lb/>in the male-dominant society. It is pain
				<lb/>ful to consider the countless lives wast
				<lb/>ed, the talents atrophied and the sick
				<lb/>ness suffered by women who were
				<lb/>never allowed, least of all encouraged,
				<lb/>to know themselves and take strength
				<lb/>and happiness in that knowledge. Sure
				<lb/>ly one of the most highly regarded uses
				<lb/>of ritual in traditional societies is the
				<lb/>curing of "soul loss" of one form or an
				<lb/>other. Twentieth-century, postindustri
				<lb/>al, special-privileged American women
				<lb/>are engaged in ritual practice for much
				<lb/>the same reason, metaphorically speak
				<lb/>For women, the ritual setting is often
				<lb/>a place for naming individual powers
				<lb/>and sharing the affirmation of those
				<lb/>powers with the group or simply inter
				<lb/>nalizing them through private ritual
				<lb/>procedure. Ritual provides a mode for
				<lb/>getting in touch with the self and stay
				<lb/>ing in touch. Also, by definition, the
				<lb/>ritual space and activity are sacred in
				<lb/>the sense of representing the possibility
				<lb/>of self-transformation. Part of the
				<lb/>power and the fear experienced in ritual
				<lb/>is the realization that one may change
				<lb/>become ultimately different, as a result
				<lb/>of the experience or that the experience
				<lb/>may suddenly make recognizable
				<lb/>change that has been slowly rising from
				<lb/>the depths of personality and ideology
				<lb/>Victor Turner states that “When a ritual
				<lb/>does work...it can cause, in some
				<lb/>cases real transformations of character
				<lb/>and of social relationships."25 1 would
				<lb/>venture to say that many women have
				<lb/>been profoundly affected and, in some
				<lb/>cases, redirected through their experi
				<lb/>ence in ritual. A lost self is recovered,
				<lb/>nurtured and allowed to emerge fully
				<lb/>named.
				<lb/>Ritual facilitates transition for the
				<lb/>participant in specific ways. As Turner
			</p>
			<pb n='26'/>
			<p>
				<lb/>clearly states, "Practically all rituals of
				<lb/>any length and complexity represent a
				<lb/>passage from one position, constella
				<lb/>tion, or domain ot structure to an
				<lb/>other.”2é This passage occurs in individ
				<lb/>ual women most dramatically, and nos
				<lb/>without fear, separation anxiety and
				<lb/>trauma. Before women can enter new
				<lb/>roles they must leave old roles behind
				<lb/>roles that once provided the comforts
				<lb/>of self-definition and reality structure
				<lb/>Ritual participation can ease transition
				<lb/>by rendering it in dramatic, metaphor
				<lb/>ical terms and providing a support
				<lb/>group to encourage and enable the
				<lb/>necessary catharsis to take place
				<lb/>The transfer of values from one
				<lb/>framework to another leaves a womar
				<lb/>just as vulnerable, suspended between
				<lb/>two life styles. It is a dangerous time fos
				<lb/>the individual, one which requires the
				<lb/>support of the feminist community anc
				<lb/>the use of ritual to promote ease in the
				<lb/>transfer. Women are realizing that this
				<lb/>is a responsibility and a desire: to help
				<lb/>other women cross boundaries in thein
				<lb/>lives not as aggressive individuals,
				<lb/>proving themselves, but as new mem
				<lb/>bers of a community who deserve the
				<lb/>help and protection of those who have
				<lb/>gone before. We have all been guarded
				<lb/>and we must all become guardians. The
				<lb/>ritual setting allows women to know
				<lb/>the power of guarding and the comfort
				<lb/>of being guarded in a space that does
				<lb/>not demand immediate resolution of
				<lb/>the passage crisis. The crisis period
				<lb/>may continue through many phases of
				<lb/>recognition, adjustment and readjust
				<lb/>ment, the assimilation of which will fall
				<lb/>primarily on the individual. But the
				<lb/>community has developed ritual means
				<lb/>by which that transformation may be
				<lb/>asserted and its painful aspects some
				<lb/>what absorbed by a formal claim made
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb/>on the individual —a claim that she is
				<lb/>new, that she is one of many, that she is
				<lb/>welcome
				<lb/>For feminists, as for other practition
				<lb/>ers of ritual, doing the ritual is more im
				<lb/>portant than knowing the ritual. The
				<lb/>eficacy of ritual is always in the acting
				<lb/>of it, in becoming bodily involved with
				<lb/>the elements, not in understanding the
				<lb/>text of belief or ideology which may
				<lb/>underlie it. The essence of ritual is in
				<lb/>physical relationship, one woman to
				<lb/>another (or one woman to herself) in
				<lb/>the circle they have created for each
				<lb/>other
				<lb/>This article only begins the necessary
				<lb/>process of defining and evaluating the
				<lb/>emergence of ritual as an important
				<lb/>component of the greater liberatior
				<lb/>movement. To my knowledge, only
				<lb/>Lucy Lippard's article in Chrysalis
				<lb/>specifically deals with the meaning of
				<lb/>ritual for feminists. No other theoretica
				<lb/>material is available although move
				<lb/>ment media sources such as Woman
				<lb/>spirit, Lady-Unique-Inclination-of-the
				<lb/>Night and Quest have been document
				<lb/>ing ritual practices among women
				<lb/>since 1974. My sense of the importance
				<lb/>of ritual for the feminist community
				<lb/>comes out of an understanding of it
				<lb/>historical importance for humanity
				<lb/>Ritual marks the ultimate ideal of rela
				<lb/>tionship between self and community
				<lb/>the fusion of two distinct realities
				<lb/>rather than separation.

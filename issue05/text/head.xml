               <lb/>Changing the Hymns to Hers
            </p>
            <p>
               <lb/>Toni Head
            </p>
            <p>
               <lb/>During the past five years of total immersion in the
               <lb/>feminist movement, I have shared with other feminists
               <lb/>the frustration of repeatedly running up against the stone
               <lb/>wall of religious dogma. This dogma functions to preserve
               <lb/>patriarchal institutions and to prevent the establishment
               <lb/>of equal rights and opportunities for women in the United
               <lb/>States and other countries throughout the world. Far from
               <lb/>becoming more tolerant as time passes, fundamentalist
               <lb/>sects are ever more rigid in their efforts to maintain the
               <lb/>subjugation of women. Ironically, religious faiths, which
               <lb/>supposedly provide the moral and ethical basis of culture,
               <lb/>are stubbornly and irrationally opposed to the develop
               <lb/>ment of a truly just, humane, equitable society.
               <lb/>My personal religious beliefs underwent a cataclysmic
               <lb/>change during adolescence, when overnight I emerged
               <lb/>from an intensely religious period into what has remained
               <lb/>a questioning, agnostic search for a satisfactory philos
               <lb/>ophy to sustain me through life. During my childhood and
               <lb/>adolescence, I deeply experienced the damage done by
               <lb/>the prevalent attitudes towards females. Perhaps for this
               <lb/>reason, 1finally found a possible answer in feminism.
               <lb/>Of all my experiences, the most fulfilling sense of unity
               <lb/>and of purpose and belief, within myself and within rela
               <lb/>tionships, has come from reading feminist literature
               <lb/>meeting, working, demonstrating, agonizing, organizing
               <lb/>and occasionally celebrating with my sisters. Neverthe
               <lb/>less, I still felt a lack, a sense of something missing. When
               <lb/>my reading progressed to a number of books, which have
               <lb/>appeared in recent years, describing the matriarchal cul
               <lb/>tures and religions that existed in prehistoric times,
               <lb/>began to understand why
               <lb/>Itried to imagine what it must have been like to live in
               <lb/>a society where people worshipped a female deity and
               <lb/>where women held positions of power and responsibility.
               <lb/>What would it feel like to pray to God the Mother? To sing
               <lb/>paeans of praise to Her glory? As l experimented, in spite
               <lb/>of my essential agnosticism, I found myself feeling a great
               <lb/>sense of peace in the mere act of praying to a loving,
               <lb/>female God. The experience was light-years away from
               <lb/>the nightmares I had suffered as a child of being con
               <lb/>signed to hell by a punitive male god. I also felt deep
               <lb/>anguish to know that such religions had existed thousands
               <lb/>of years ago, only to have been ruthlessly destroyed by
               <lb/>barbaric patriarchal invaders.
               <lb/>When I discussed these ideas with feminists from other
               <lb/>parts of the world, at the International Women’s Year
               <lb/>Tribune in Mexico City, at the International Tribunal on
               <lb/>Crimes Against Women in Brussels and with women I met
               <lb/>during other travels, they were as enthusiastic as my
               <lb/>sisters closer to home.
            </p>
            <p>
               <lb/>The IWY Florida Conference in Orlando last July pro
               <lb/>vided the stimulus to goad me into action. Mormons,
               <lb/>Baptists and various fundamentalist religious groups were
               <lb/>there in force, joined with the American Nazi Party, John
               <lb/>Birch Society and Ku Klux Klan to try to subvert the
               <lb/>conference. When they began singing hymns, I sang along
               <lb/>but with one major difference: I changed the hymns to
               <lb/>Hers. When they sang, &quot;He’s got the whole world in his
               <lb/>hands,&quot; l happily warbled, &quot;She’s got the whole world..
               <lb/>When the conference closed with a recitation of the
               <lb/>Lord’s Prayer, I joyfully intoned, “Our Mother who art in
               <lb/>heaven...&quot; And when I returned home after the con
               <lb/>ference was over, I sent my granddaughter a new version
               <lb/>of Jesus Loves Me, which is:
               <lb/>Isis loves me, this I know
               <lb/>Mother God has told me so.
               <lb/>She is strong and so are we
               <lb/>Fighting for equality.
               <lb/>Yes, Isis loves me
               <lb/>Yes, Isis loves me
               <lb/>Yes, Isis loves me
               <lb/>Our Lady told me so.
               <lb/>After the Orlando conference, Becky Berg, Florida
               <lb/>State Coordinator of the National Organization for Wom
               <lb/>en, asked me to help her conduct a workshop on women
               <lb/>and religion at the Florida NOW State Conference last
               <lb/>September. In preparation for this conference I began to
               <lb/>think through some of the ideas that had been taking form
               <lb/>in my mind.
               <lb/>The sum total of my experiences led me to realize that
               <lb/>lack of faith in an organized religion had left a hole in my
               <lb/>life which no amount of rational, philosophical specula
               <lb/>tions about the meaning of it all can fill. The fact is
               <lb/>enjoy the rituals, symbols, songs, processions, ceremonies
               <lb/>—the full panoply of organized religion. I like to wear
               <lb/>clothing and jewelry that express my commitment to and
               <lb/>faith in my beliefs. I enjoy singing along with people,
               <lb/>joining hands, performing rites and acts that physically
               <lb/>demonstrate and symbolize my emotional, spiritual and
               <lb/>philosophical self—my deepest being. But I also realize
               <lb/>that I am quite incapable of participating in such rituals
               <lb/>while being totally opposed to the doctrines they rep
               <lb/>resent. There is no way I can take part in a religion that
               <lb/>preaches the subjugation of women.
               <lb/>The answer to this dilemma then became so obvious
               <lb/>that I am shocked not to have found it sooner. I believe
               <lb/>the answer is to reinstate a feminist religion that can fulfill
               <lb/>the human need for religious rituals at the same time that
               <lb/>it celebrates our feminist faith in the ultimate good of
            </p>
            <pb n='17'/>
            <p>
               <lb/>being female and invokes the Mother-God-given right of
               <lb/>every woman to enjoy full freedom and equal opportunity
               <lb/>in all aspects of life.
               <lb/>Such a religion would provide opportunities for women
               <lb/>to meet together to take part in ceremonies and to reaf
               <lb/>firm our faith in our feminist beliefs. This spiritual and
               <lb/>emotional renewal would strengthen the bonds among us.
               <lb/>Besides providing spiritual sustenance, the feminist
               <lb/>religion could be a powerful tool in our fight for equal
               <lb/>rights. In spite of the supposed Constitutional separation
               <lb/>of church and state, the fact is that our legal codes are
               <lb/>based on patriarchal religious dogmas and customs. The
               <lb/>frequency with which opponents of the Equal Rights
               <lb/>Amendment and other feminist issues quote the Bible to
               <lb/>justify their opposition is evidence enough of the use of
               <lb/>religion for political purposes. The doctrine of an or
               <lb/>ganized religion that propounds feminist values as the
               <lb/>direct reflection of Divine Intention is the ultimate answer
               <lb/>to those who argue that a male god has decreed other
               <lb/>wise. Fighting fire with fire, our rites could help us win our
               <lb/>rights.
               <lb/>The NOW conference workshop offered the opportu
               <lb/>nity to explain these feelings and experiences to other
               <lb/>women and to propose that we establish our own feminist
               <lb/>religion. I also offered a few specific suggestions that
               <lb/>seemed positive. First, that the religion be as undogmatic
               <lb/>and non-authoritarian as possible to best serve as a ve
               <lb/>hicle for expressing the thoughts, feelings, needs and
               <lb/>desires of all of us. Second, that care must be exercised to
               <lb/>avoid forming the usual hierarchy of clergy as separate
               <lb/>from congregation and to assure maximum participation
               <lb/>of everyone concerned in formulating and carrying out
               <lb/>the doctrines and rituals of a feminist religion.
               <lb/>do, however, believe that a formal women’s religious
               <lb/>organization would be economically advantageous in that
               <lb/>it would enable us to have access to the tax benefits
               <lb/>allowed to other religious groups. These benefits could
               <lb/>help to cover the cost of clinics, publications, learning
               <lb/>centers and many other aspects of the women’s move
               <lb/>ment
               <lb/>In addition to these considerations, there is one fun
               <lb/>damental principle that I feel must be basic to our religion
               <lb/>if it is to express feminist beliefs. This is the divine right of
               <lb/>every child to be born to a mother who wants it, which in
               <lb/>turn would assure every woman the right to control her
               <lb/>own body and to bear children only when and if she
               <lb/>wholeheartedly wants to do so. I feel that the act of
               <lb/>exercising this control, whether by means of birth control,
               <lb/>abortion or abstention, should be considered to be in
               <lb/>total accord with our belief in &quot;divine intention.
               <lb/>would also like to see the physical fact of being
               <lb/>female sanctified and celebrated. Since the aura of guilt
               <lb/>and disgust surrounding female physiology promulgated
               <lb/>by a misogynistic patriarchy is so destructive and damag
               <lb/>ing to women’s emotional and physical well-being,
               <lb/>would like to see this attitude replaced by feelings of joy
               <lb/>and self-affirmation in the inherent good of being female.
               <lb/>Generally, I would like our feminist religion to be
               <lb/>positive, joyous and free of fear. Rather than teaching the
               <lb/>dogma of original sin, we could proclaim the fact of
               <lb/>original good. I would prefer a list of “Thou shalts” rather
               <lb/>than &quot;Thou shalt nots&quot; and a philosophy of rewards for
               <lb/>doing good rather than punishments for doing wrong.
               <lb/>would like our religion to affirm the intrinsic good of all
               <lb/>expressions of love between humans, regardless of sex or
               <lb/>of other artificial restrictions imposed by a patriarchal
               <lb/>autocracy.

               <lb/>Along with the suggestions that have been mentioned,
               <lb/>we would welcome a wide diversity of other ideas, ac
               <lb/>cording to people’s needs and desires. These might come
               <lb/>from Wicca, Zen or any other source that we feel has
               <lb/>something valuable to offer us.
               <lb/>In summary, I would like to mention that the enthusi
               <lb/>astic response of those who took part in the NOW work-
               <lb/>shop convinced me that many women feel the need for a
               <lb/>religion of our own and I suggest that the time is ripe for
               <lb/>establishing it now.

               <lb/>The Mother Church Inc. is legally incorporated in the
               <lb/>state of Florida. Its members are now in the process of
               <lb/>applying for tax exempt status. Toni Head writes, &quot;Ac
               <lb/>cording to NARAL, various Dioceses and Archdioceses of
               <lb/>the Catholic Church contributed over §450,000 from Janu
               <lb/>ary 1976 to March 1977 to the National Committee for a
               <lb/>Human Life Amendment to make abortions illegal by a
               <lb/>constitutional amendment. That is only the record of
               <lb/>contributions of $500 or more. In order to protect the
               <lb/>principle of separation of church and state, I think that
               <lb/>there should be no tax exemptions for religions, but since
               <lb/>there are, it is essential that we share the advantage.

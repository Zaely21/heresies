			<p>
				The Earth has thousands of sanctuaries dedicated to the Great Goddess. Some are caves inhabited over
				30,000 years ago by our Paleolithic
				ancestors. Some are elaborate megalithic temples erected 6,000 years ago
				at the height of Goddess-centered
				civilization. And some are world
				famous architectural monuments built
				during the patriarchal age but inspired
				by and dedicated to deities in whom
				important vestiges of the Goddess
				have endured</p>
				<p>Originally the holiest places were
				those that nature created—caves
				springs, hills, groves, rivers—for the
				Earth itself was the Goddess and her
				sacred places were analogous to erogenous zones or acupuncture points in
				her body. Here the configuration of
				natural forces and energy currents was
				and is extraordinarily benevolent to
				all life forms. Such special places,
				revealed through dreams, alterec
				states of consciousness and identification with nature, became sites for
				healing rituals, prophecies, festivals
				and pilgrimages. In time, villagers
				who lived nearby constructed temples
				to honor that female power which had
				been channeled so generously through
				such sites for their benefit. The temples were not only abodes of the Goddess but also simulated her body or
				womb. Her temples induced her presence and in all probability people felt
				that she actually directed their construction much as an artist today may
				feel directed in the fabrication of a
				work. Thus it may be said that the
				temples of the Great Goddess give us
				a record of how she manifested herself. Certainly they show how she was
				seen by people in ancient times and
				how she evolved in different cultures.
			</p>
			<p>
				We can think of the Goddess’s sanctuaries as weaving around the Earth a
				network of psychic and natural forces
				conjoined for all time at the nodes
				where her temples were constructed.
				Unfortunately, large sections of this
				precious fabric have been destroyed.
				One main way that patriarchal rulers
				imposed their authority was by usurping the Goddess's earthly power
				nodes, destroying her temples and
				erecting their own monuments. Many
				of these late temples, dedicated to
				patriarchal religions, still stand as
				"navels of the world." Much research
				and excavation must be done to unearth this superimposition in order to
				reveal the original matriarchal stratum.</p>
				<p>But the temples of the Great Goddess are not merely historical relics.
				Like the rituals from which they
				evolved they are living archetypes in
				our minds today. As models of eternal
				structures of consciousness, they can
				help us unravel the patriarchal overlay
				in our own psyches that has hidden
				our original source of wholeness and
				power. Most exciting is that these and
				other archetypes are spontaneously
				reemerging in the works of contemporary artists and architects and in
				women’s visions for transforming the
				fabric of our lives, our society and our
				civilization.</p>
				<p>It was difficult to select from the
				thousands of Goddess temples in the
				world only eighteen to show here,
				but this small sample represents the
				range of temples that were built tothe
				Great Goddess starting with primitive
				sanctuaries of the Earth Mother and
				culminating in sophisticated urban
				temples to the Queen of Heaven.

				1. Catal Huyuk Shrine, Anatolia.
				Ca. 5700 B.C.</p>
				<p>In the compact, multileveled Neolithic town of Catal Huyuk, 40 of the
				139 buildings excavated were shrines.
				They were similar to the houses but
				larger and richer in artwork. Many
				images of the Goddess showed her
				flanked by two leopards as if they supported her during childbirth. In shrines
				like the one shown here, wall reliefs
				depicted the Goddess in a childbirth
				posture with bulls’ heads below her-
				an archetypal representation of the
				Goddess giving birth to the lunar bull.
				The Goddess’s upraised arms repeat
				the form of the bull's horns, a magical
				gesture common to later Near Eastern
				figures. In Egypt, the symbolic horns
				were linked to the ever-important
				Cow Goddess Hathor. At Catal Huyuk
				concentric rings were drawn over the
				womb of the birth-giving Goddess
				suggesting a primordial origin of the
				labyrinth. Breasts sculpted on walls
				transformèd some shrines into symbols of the body of the Goddess.
				Some of the breast sculptures contained vulture beaks and skulls. In
				actual practice the bones of the dead
				were probably picked clean by vultures before they were buried in the
				shrines. The breasts show that this
				process was part of the continuous
				cycle of life, death and rebirth that
				was the realm of the Great Goddess.

				2. Shrine of Sabatinovka, Soviet
				Moldavia. Ca. 4500 B.C.</p>
				<p>This temple from the Neolithic
				Cucuteni or Tripolye culture of Old
				Europe, described in Marija Gimbutas's The Cods and Coddesses of
				Old Europe, contained objects typically symbolic of the Goddess-especially the Horns of Consecration
				and the serpent. A total of thirty-two
				clay female figurines was found
				of them are schematically rendered
				with fat thighs and a snake-shaped
				head. A few were perforated through
				the shoulders, but have no arms except one who holds a baby snake or
				phallus, Gimbutas writes. In addition, there was a large horned throne,
				presumably for the presiding priestess,
				and a large oven. To Gimbutas, "the
				association of quemn and grindstone.
				with figurines portrayed in a seated
				position suggests magical grinding of
			</p>
         				<figure></figure>
			<p>
				grain and then perhaps baking of
				<lb/>sacred bread."</p>
				<p>4. Horns of Consecration, Palace of
				Knossos. Crete. 2000-1450 B.C.</p>
				<p>One of the highest civilizations of
				the ancient world flourished on Crete
				until about 1400 B.C. The important
				architectural remains consist of several fabulous so-called palaces and
				hundreds of tholos tombs. The palaces are free of signs of despotic
				power, and the lack of defensive fortifications in Cretan architecture indicates a lack of tyranny or military
				tension; this was a civilization that
				managed to achieve luxury without
				armed might. The palaces do display
				innovations that ensured a comfortable, sensuous environment:
				beautiful frescoes, sophisticated
				water and drainage systems (inventions often attributed to the Romans),
				multi-storied apartments with light
				wells and extensive temple repositories. That Cretan civilization was
				Goddess-centered is undisputed. Its
				Serpent Goddesses, sacred bulls,
				labrys’ or double axes, Horns of consecration and fabled labyrinth are
				now prime symbols of Goddess wor-
				ship against which the artifacts of
				other cultures are measured.</p>
				<p>On Crete, the Goddess was first
				worshipped in the huge natural caves
				in sacred horned mountains like
				Mount Ida, Mount Jouctas and Mount
				Dikte. These continued to be used for
				sacred rituals and to be frequented
				sanctuaries even at the height of
				Cretan civilization. In The Earth, The
				Temple, and The Cods, architectural
			</p>
         				<figure></figure>
			<p>
				historian Vincent Scully maintains
				tnat not even the palaces were of
				greatest architectural importance on
				Crete. He believes that their siting in
				the landscape was more important.
				Typically each temple, here as well as
				throughout Greece, was built in an
				enclosed valley and aligned on a
				north/south axis to have a view across
				the valley of a conical hill, and beyond that, to a horned or double-peaked mountain that contained a
				cave sanctuary. At the Palace of
				Knossos these features were sited/
				sighted through the Horns of Consecration. The proper siting of the
				palace accentuated the meaning of
				the landscape as the body of the Goddess. The valley was her encircling
				arms; the conical hill, her breast or
				nurturing function; the horned mountain, her "lap" or cleft vulva, the
				Earth’s active power; and the cave
				sanctuary, her birth-giving womb.</p>

         		<p>5. Mnajdra Temple, Malta.
         		Ca. 3300 B.C.</p>
				<pb n='34'/>
         	<figure></figure>
			<p>
				6. Hal Tarxien Temple, Malta,
				approach to the Holy of Holies</p>
				<p>The impressive temples on the Island of Malta are the most complex
				structures to have survived among a
				vast system of prehistoric megalithic
				monuments dedicated to the Goddess
				(see. The Realm of the Creat Coddess
				by Sibylle von Cles-Reden and The
				Silbury Treasure by Michael Dames).
				The Maltese temples take the form of
				the body of the Goddess more clearly
				than do any other temples. Colossal
				and diminutive statues found in the
				temples show that the Goddess worshipped there had the same shape as
				her temples—ample, rounded, generous; thus entrance into any of these
				temples was tantamount to entering
				the Goddess for physical and spiritual
				rebirth. The sanctuaries were constructed of huge stones using methods
				similar to those at Stonehenge. There
				is reason to believe that there were
				other cross-cultural influences, as the
				ubiquitous serpentine spiral carvings
				that dominate the entrances to the
				Maltese temples, and which may symbolize the telluric serpent, are alsc
				prominent in European passage graves
				and on Neolithic pottery. Revised datings of European and Maltese megalithic monuments based on corrected
				radio-carbon and tree-ring chronologies have overturned the orthodox
				view that these monuments resulted
				from the diffusion of "superior
				Mesopotamian, Egyptian or Mycenaean cultures, and have shown that
				these structures preceded similar developments in the East. The Maltese
			</p>
			<p>
				temples, so clearly dedicated to the
				Great Goddess, have been largely ignored and the finds distorted. As recently as November, 1977, the Great
				Goddess of Malta was described in
				National Ceographic simply as the
				headless fat lady.

				7. Stonehenge and its geospiral.
				Begun ca. 2200 B.C.
			</p>
			<p>
				8. Silbury Hill, England. Ca. 2700 B.C.</p>
				<p>Stonehenge was the culmination of
				a vast system of stone circles, woodhenges, earthworks and megalithic
				monuments that were first built
				around 4000 B.C. by agrarian peoples
				in Western Europe, Iberia, Scandinavia and the British Isles. Somewhat similar systems were eventually
				built throughout the Mediterranean,
				Eastern Europe, the Near East, Asia
				Oceania and the Americas. Male
				archaeologists were quick to assume
			</p>
         	<figure></figure>
			<p>
				that all such works were the products
				of patriarchal societies, and indeed
				some mounds in some places entombed the remains of important
				chieftains. Discoveries of the mathematical and astronomical significance
				of monuments like Stonehenge reinforced the idea that they were built by
				a Sky-Father-logos-oriented priesthood. But now there is mounting
				evidence that Stonehenge and the entire megalithic system also mapped
				the Earth’s telluric currents, named for
				the Roman Earth Goddess Tellus. (See
				John Michell’s books). These currents
				are spiraling and linear configurations
				in the Earth’s magnetic field produced
				by terrestrial magma, subterranean
				watercourses, the rotation and revolution of the Earth, and the influence of
				the sun, moon, planets and cosmic
				particles. Agricultural communities
				are particularly dependent upon these
				forces since they not only determine
				the weather but also profoundly affect
				the fecundity of the land. Detailed
				surveys of the telluric currents at
				Stonehenge and other megalithic sites
				were described by the dowser Guy
				Underwood in The Pattern of the Past.
				Among the currents that Underwood
				mapped at Stonehenge was the geospiral around the altar stone that
				delineated the magnetic field of a
				strong subterranean spring. Such
				"blind springs" were vital to both
				animals and humans because they
				had healing properties and affected
				fertility. They are related to the sacred
				springs of the Goddess found the
				world over.

				Stonehenge was built in several
				stages. First to be constructed was the
				outer ring of fifty-six Aubrey holes
				that predicted an 18.6-year cycle of
				lunar orbits and eclipses. Correlations
				among the moon, menstruation,
				blood, water and tides, fertility, birth
				and the Goddess are primordial women’s mysteries, and it is likely that
				Stonehenge’s Aubrey holes came out
				of this matriarchal tradition. Their telluric significance may lie in the fact
				that lunar eclipses cause demonstrable disturbances in the Earth's
				magnetic field. Zoologists have found
				that extreme disturbances in the
				Earth’s field, such as the periodic reversal of poles, cause the total extinction of many small species of life. The
				Aubrey holes may have helped to predict such subtle organic processes of
				life and death.</p>
				<p>Women wise in the ways of Wicca
				intuitively knew that stone circles
				arked magic circles, that stone alignments facilitated the observation of
				the eight sabbats, and that earth-mounds represented the body of the
				Great Goddess. This intuition is supported by evidence recently published
				(in Michael Dames’s The Silbury
				Treasure: The Creat Coddess Rediscovered) that England’s Silbury Hill,
				which stands near Stonehenge and is
				the largest prehistoric structure in all
				Europe, was built not as a tomb of a
				king but as the life-giving womb and
				all-seeing eye of the Great Goddess.
				The practice of building or visiting
				harvest hills to celebrate the First
				Fruits Festival of Lammas still survives
				today in some farming communities
				on the British Isles.

         		<p>9. Trinity Chapel, Canterbury
         		Cathedral, England. Ca. 1180 A.D.
			</p>
			<p>
				10. Labyrinth, Notre Dame de
				Chartres, France. Twelfth,
				thirteenth centuries A.D.</p>
				<p>The fact that Trinity Chapel is a structure having the same plan as the megalithic monuments at Woodhenge and
				Stonehenge, and was laid out using the
				same design principles, lends credence
				to the assumption that the chapel and
				corona were raised over pagan foundations. (Lyle Borst and Barbara Borst,
				Megalithic Software, pp. 18-19.)</p>
				<p>That cathedral apses evolved from
				the cave sanctuaries of the Goddess is
				quite certain, but recent evidence
				shows that many English cathedral
				apses or "Lady Chapels” also reflect
				the distinctive egg/womb shape of
				henge monuments like Stonehenge
				and Woodhenge. The Borsts’ drawing
				shows the geometry of the henge
				foundation at Canterbury including
				part of the pentagram that had to be
				constructed in order to lay out the irregular
			</p>
       		<figure></figure>
			<p>
				circles. The pentagram was
				apparently a fundamental geometric
				principle of megalithic architecture
				from Malta to the British Isles, and
				may have been a precursor of the pentagram of witchcraft.</p>
				<p>According to Henry Adams in
				Mont-Saint-Michel &amp; Chartres, the
				great French Gothic cathedrals were
				built during a time when the cult of
				the Virgin Mary” was burgeoning,
				when French queens were powerful,
				when women participated quite fully
				in medieval society (there are records
				of payments to female quarry owners
				and to women laborers who took part
				in building the cathedrals), and when
				European culture was being fertilized
				by passionate pagan legends dressed
				up as the literature of courtly love.
				In silent testimony to their matrilineal
				origins, nearly all French Gothic
				cathedrals had a stone labyrinth pattern in the floors of their naves. Most
				of the labyrinths were removed during
				the super-rational Age of Enlightenment; however, the one at Chartres
				has survived.</p>
				<p>11. Ziggurat in the Eanna at Erech,
				Sumer. Third millennium B.C.</p>
				<p>A crumbling mound is nearly all
				that remains of Eanna, the complex
				temple precinct in the once great city
				of Erech (Uruk). Eanna was the most
				important of several sacred centers of
				Inanna, the Sumerian Queen of Heaven (Ishtar in Babylon). It was in Eanna
				that the earliest writing was discovered
				— records dated before 3000 B.C. kept
				by scribe priestesses who managed the
				extensive business and real estate

				S.N. Kramer) are among the most truly erotic poems ever written and pre-figure Solomon’s Song of Songs. This

			<p>
				rite occurred at the New Year when
				Inanna, or her priestess surrogate,
				copulated with the king making him
				her consort, Dumuzi, thereby bestowing on him power to rule as king.
				Inanna as the Queen of Heaven was
				the supreme source of power, and her
				union with the king took place at the
				summit of the world mountain in the
				temple atop the ziggurat.</p>
				<p>References to Inanna's temples in
				the story of her descent into the
				netherworld give us another indication of her power. When she descended, wanting to be Queen of the “Great
				Below" as well as Queen of the “Great
				Above, she is described as abandoning heaven, earth and seven of her
				major temples, and fastening the
				seven me to her side. The me were all
				important to Sumerians as "the divine
				rules and regulations that keep the
				universe operating as planned.
				(Kramer, p. 167.) Elsewhere Inanna is
				named as “Queen of all the me." The
				naming of Inanna’s seven temples and
				her mastery of the seven me suggest
				power over the seven visible "planets
				which were believed to regulate the
				entire universe and course of human
				events. This belief was the accepted
				cosmological theory until the Renaissance, and even today it figures in
				astrology and in the yogic chakra system. The seven temples of Inanna
				were probably a symbolic architectural representation on Earth of the
				order of the Universe above. Queen
				of Heaven Inanna was indeed!</p>
				<p>12. Temple of Isis, Philae, Egypt.
				Fourth to second centuries B.C.</p>
				<p>The tiny island of Philae, near the
				First Cataract of Aswan on the Nile,
				was long a sanctuary for travelers;
			</p>
        	<figure></figure>
			<p>
				dedicatory inscriptions on nearby
				rocks date from as early as 2280 B.C.
				This great center of healing was covered with temples dedicated to various divinities, the most important of
				which was Isis. Nubian inscriptions
				mention the oracles of Isis which had
				for centuries been revealed through
				dreams to those who slept in the great
				rock pylon temple (see Jayne, The
				Healing Cods of Ancient Civilizations, pp. 30, 67). This temple was
				said to be the most beautiful Iseum in
				all of Egypt. Philae became the foremost center of Isis worship in the
				ancient world, and by Ptolemaic
				times was the principal holy site of
				Egypt.</p>
				<p>The protected island was the last
				stronghold of Goddess worship after
				Christian Rome either sealed of
				destroyed all the pagan temples in the
				Empire. In the mid-fifth century A.D.
				a local Nubian tribe still continuec
				their ancient annual tradition of transporting the temple’s sacred image of
				Isis by boat to the fertile hills on the
				<lb/>opposite shore where she presidec
				<lb/>over their harvest rites (see R.E. Witt,
				<lb/>Isis in the Craeco-Roman World, p.
				<lb/>62). It is no surprise then that Philae
				<lb/>continued to be a sanctuary for Nubians and desert peoples until the
				modern reservoir created by the
				Aswan Dam submerged the island and
				the nearby ancestral homelands of the
				relatively matriarchal Nubians.
				first structure to be saved from the
				threatening dam system was, of
				course, Abu Simbel, the pompous
				monument of the despotic pharaoh
				Ramesses II, but work is now underway to dismantle the Temple of Isis
				which will be rebuilt on the island of
				Agilkia 500 yards away.

				13. The Zodiac of Dendera</p>
				<p>14. Egyptian Drawing of the Temple
				of Dendera as the Horns of
				Consecration</p>
				<p>The great Temple of Dendera was
				built very late in Egyptian civilization
				and was dedicated to Hathor. As one
				of the most enduring of Goddesses
				Hathor was first worshipped as the
				lunar cow at a time in prehistory when
				animals were revered more than humans. The structures surrounding her
				temple, while by no means unique to
				Dendera, retain some undying matrilineal associations. They include a
				sacred lake, a building for divine healing, two birth houses, two wells and a
				small temple of Isis. By late pharaonic
				times most large temples, whether
				dedicated to goddesses or gods, had
				these features and all were imbued
				with magical, mythological and political significance. For instance the
				birth houses celebrated the holy birth
				of the pharaoh and sanctioned her or
				his divine authority to rule. This was
				usually shown through images of the
				pharaoh suckling Hathor’s udders.
				Through her milk, Hathor bestowed
				the power and life-sustenance that
				was the matrix of the universe. By the
				time Dendera was built, the image of
				the suckling king had probably been
				subverted politically to maintain the
				surface myth of matrilineal royal
				descent while actually strengthening
				the power of an evolving patriarchal
				order.</p>
				<p>The enduring testimony of Hathor’s
				worship provides a valuable transitional record that can greatly aid attempts to restore women’s heritage.
				For example, the drawing of the Temple of Dendera as the Horns of Consecration with Hathor ascending on
				the horizon bathed in the solar rays
				emanating from the Sky Goddess Nut,
				is rich in universal Goddess imagery.
				The Horns of Consecration recall the
			</p>
			<pb n='37'/>
			<p>
				horns of Catal Huyuk, Sabatinovka,
				Beycesultan, Knossos, and even of
				Sumer where early temples are shown
				with horns and the sacred crown consisted of tiers of horns (the tiers being
				related to the levels of the ziggurats
				and possibly to the yogic conception
				of chakra-levels of consciousness).
				Hathor’s horns may also be archetypally related to Paleolithic moon/
				menstruation/blood/bull mysteries
				and to some of the earliest art ever
				produced, such as that found in the
				Hall of Bulls at Lascaux, France.</p>
				<p>Of interest at Dendera are the many
				Hathor-headed columns in the Great
				Vestibule. There are two sets of nine
				columns, each surmounted by four
				Hathor-heads which face in the four
				directions and symbolize universal
				power. (Unfortunately every single
				head was mutilated long ago by
				Christian fanatics.) The famous Zodiac of Dendera and other celestial
				maps and symbols decorated the temple ceilings to honor Hathor as the
				Celestial Cow. The Zodiac was complete with all the astrological signs
				still in use today, and its precise orientation helped to date the temple because of the axial shift occasioned by
				the precession of the equinoxes.

				15. Eleusis with the Plutonium,
				Greece. First millennium B.C.</p>
				<p>Eleusis was the site of the great
				temple and altar that Demeter commanded to be built to teach her rites
				and to reveal the secrets of immortality. It was also the site where she
				was reunited with her daughter Persephone, who had been abducted into
			</p>
        	<figure></figure>
			<p>
				the underworld by Hades and who reemerged through the Plutonium cave.
				The nine day cycle of the Eleusinian
				Mysteries, during which the myths of
				Demeter and Persephone were probably reenacted, was the center of
				Greek religious life for centuries.
				Though thousands were initiated into
				the mysteries each year, they were
				sworn to strictest secrecy. Even today
				little is known about the rites. What
				few facts have been deduced do not
				adequatley reveal the true emotional
				and spiritual power that made the
				Eleusinian Mysteries so revered.
				Though no details of the rites were
				ever written down, there were references to their effects in the Homeric
				Hymns and other writings. Various
				scholars have speculated that the
				Mysteries created a sense of bliss by
				revealing the biological, agricultural
				and spiritual continuity of life. At a
				time when patriarchy was omnipotent, the Eleusinian Mysteries reabsorbed people into the great round of
				natural matrilineal cycles. Over the
				centuries the temple was expanded
				several times to accommodate elaborations in the rites and the growing
				numbers of initiates; however, like all
				pagan sanctuaries, Eleusis was eventually destroyed by Christians. Today
				only the ruins of Demeter’s great temple remain as one of the precious few
				records of her Mysteries.

				16. Oracle of Delphi, Greece.
				First millennium B.C.</p>
				<p>Long before the influential oracular
				site of Delphi was seized by Apollo, it
				was a sacred part of the body of the
				Earth Mother Gaea. From a seismic
				cleft in this "body of Gaea, exuded
				intoxicating gases that induced prophetic
			</p>
			<pb n='38'/>
			<p>
				visions. Apollo killed the great
				Python, protector of the site; thereafter Pythia, the priestess who pronounced the prophecies, spoke for
				Apollo rather than Gaea. The original
				site now lies buried beneath Apollo’s
				temple.</p>
				<p>The theme of male gods and heroes
				slaying serpents or dragons to gain
				control of matriarchal realms is universal in mythology. The serpent is
				usually interpreted as a symbol of unconscious instinctual drives that must
				be conquered to achieve human
				consciousness, but other interpretations are possible. Merlin Stone
				argues in When Cod Was a Woman
				that the serpent may have been an aid
				to prophecy. She cites a recent study
				showing that people who have been
				immunized by gradual exposure to
				snake-bite do not die when bitten by a
				venomous serpent, but rather experience prophetic psychedelic visions.
				We could conclude that the male
				heroes were slaying the visionary feminine imagination (i.e. the Python) in
				order to impose the rational masculine mind (i.e. Apollo).</p>
				<p>Another interpretation is that the
				serpent-slayer myth encapsulates a
				long and bloody conflict between the
				indigenous Aegean Stone and Bronze
				Age matriarchal culture, which focused on living in harmony with the
				Earth’s telluric currents (symbolized
				by the serpent), and the invading
				patriarchal Indo-European culture,
				which virtually worshipped metal
				(symbolized by the serpent-slayer).
				The Indo-Europeans were crude iron
				workers and warriors. They worshipped a god of volcanic mountains,
				and their most esteemed citizen was
				the blacksmith. Horse-drawn chariots
				and iron weapons made them formidable conquerors, and wherever
				they went, from Europe to India, their
				assimilation marked the beginning of
				the Iron Age. According to dowsers,
				ferrous metals nullify all sensitivity to
				the telluric currents. The serpent-slayer myth, then, could be a vivid
				image of the destruction of the whole
				matriarchal way of life. It encodes the
				earliest instances of the contempt for
				nature that has become so much a
				part of the patriarchy’s technological
				imperative— and such an anathema to
				the female soul.</p>
				<p>17. The Parthenon, reconstruction
				of Athene’s Statue, Greece.
				447-432 B.C.</p>
				<p>The Parthenon is the most celebrated Goddess temple in the world. Jewel
				of the Acropolis, it epitomized the
			</p>
        	<figure></figure>
			<p>
				glory of Athens, Athene’s city, and the
				whole of the classical world. For 2500
				years it has remained the architectural
				ideal of Western civilization. The Parthenon was named for and dedicated
				to Athene Parthenos. Parthenos,
				meaning "virgin” as in parthenogenesis, “virgin birth"), traditionally did
				not mean "celibate” but rather, unmarried, complete-in-herself, selfcreating. A virgin gave birth to herself, not babies, and to culture. Plato
				alluded to this when he said that those
				who are pregnant in the body give
				birth to children; those who are pregnant in the soul give birth to culture.
				Because Athene had always been a
				virgin culture-bearer as opposed to a
				wifely child-bearer, the Indo-Europeans could not convincingly domesticate her, as they had the other goddesses, by marrying her to Zeus. Finally, through the ingenious contrivance
				of making her Zeus’s daughter, born
				from his head, they corrupted her to
				serve their ends. She was turned into a
				Goddess of War who sanctioned
				bloody battles against even her own
				sisters, the Amazons. She was portrayed aiding all the heroes as they
				slew the serpents, Gorgons and other
				symbols of matriarchal order. Her
				temple was absolutely devoid of
				traditional Goddess imagery. Beautiful as it was, it had no caves, apses,
				egg/wombs, or Horns of Consecration
				—only rational mathematical proportions</p>
				<p>A monumental statue of Athene
				that has not survived dominated the
				Parthenon. However, conjectural reconstructions of it show Athene with
			</p>
			<p>
				the Gorgon’s head around her neck
				like a trophy or psychological shadow.
				Her great serpent, warrior's shield and
				spear are at her side as references to
				both the telluric serpent and lron Age
				weapons, and in her hand she holds a
				crystal ball. Her image could represent either a true matriarchal Goddess or an anima figure—the symbol
				of feminine consciousness as experienced by men. (This revised Athene
				was, after all, born from Zeus’s head).</p>
				<p>As overseer of the dominating telluric serpents and wearer of the Corgon’s head, Athene appears to represent the spiritualization of telluric
				or Kundalini energy. Kundalini symbolizes in Hindu philosophy the
				serpent-energy of the Goddess who,
				through a series of yogic exercises, is
				made to ascend the spinal column to
				elicit pure consciousness. The Western counterpart is the psychoanalytical channeling of the contents of the
				unconscious into consciousness to
				achieve self-knowledge. As the self-creating Goddess of Wisdom, Athene
				seems to combine the two traditions.
				Pure consciousness (wisdom, self-knowledge) is symbolized in Tibetan
				Buddhism by the “Jewel Ornament of
				the Liberation” and in Chinese art by a
				crystal in the claw of the telluric
				dragon. Was it symbolized in classical
				Greece by the crystal in Athene's
				hand? And is the Parthenon’s pristine
				geometry a monument to the minds
				of the men who sapped Athene's
				power or is it a monument to a form
				of pure consciousness inherent in the
				Great Goddess?

				18. Ise Shrine, Japan.
				685 A.D. or earlier</p>
				<p>As the national shrine of Shintoism,
				Ise is the most beloved sanctuary in
				Japan. Far from being a monumental
				stone structure, it is a simple, tiny
			</p>
			<pb n='39'/>
			<p>
				group of buildings made of wood and
				thatch. Strongly centered in Goddess
				worship, Shintoism remains one of the
				few nature-based religions in the
				world today. The need to renew Ise's
				nature spirits, as well as to preserve its
				material structure, has resulted in one
				of the most telling examples in the
				history of architecture of human dedication to a shrine. Every twenty
				years, from 685 A.D. to today, Ise has
				been painstakingly dismantled and rebuilt on alternating sites. The reconstruction is so exact that the history of
				Japanese religions from prehistoric to
				modern times can be read in the structures. Through studying Ise and the
				rituals performed there now, scholars
				have been able to reconstruct the
				original rite. It consisted of “a priestess, worshipping beside a sacred
				planted bough, which received the
				guardian deity when she descended
				from heaven. Sanctified at Ise are a
				hill, a bush, water and stones, a
				sacred mirror, [and) the sacred pillar,
				which is half-buried beneath the floor
				of the shrine.” (Masuda, p. 16)</p>
				<p>The whole archetypal matriarchal
				cycle from prehistory's Goddess of
				Fertility to civilization's Queen of
				Heaven, as well as the history of
				Japanese religion, is compressed into
				the two modest shrines at Ise. The
				outer shrine, called the Gegü, is dedicated to Toyukehime, the Goddess of
				Fertility and Grain—the primeval
				Earth Mother. The inner shrine, called
				the Naigü, is dedicated to Amaterasu,
				the Sun Goddess who today emblazons the Japanese flag and from
				whom all Japanese emperors claimed
				descent.</p>

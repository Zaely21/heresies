				<lb/>Temples of the Great Goddess
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb/>Mimi Lobell
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb/>The Earth has thousands of sanc
				<lb/>tuaries dedicated to the Great God
				<lb/>dess. Some are caves inhabited over
				<lb/>30,000 years ago by our Paleolithic
				<lb/>ancestors. Some are elaborate mega
				<lb/>lithic temples erected 6,000 years ago
				<lb/>at the height of Goddess-centered
				<lb/>civilization. And some are world
				<lb/>famous architectural monuments built
				<lb/>during the patriarchal age but inspired
				<lb/>by and dedicated to deities in whom
				<lb/>important vestiges of the Goddess
				<lb/>have endured
				<lb/>Originally the holiest places were
				<lb/>those that nature created—caves
				<lb/>springs, hills, groves, rivers—for the
				<lb/>Earth itself was the Goddess and her
				<lb/>sacred places were analogous to erog
				<lb/>enous zones or acupuncture points in
				<lb/>her body. Here the configuration of
				<lb/>natural forces and energy currents was
				<lb/>and is extraordinarily benevolent to
				<lb/>all life forms. Such special places,
				<lb/>revealed through dreams, alterec
				<lb/>states of consciousness and identifica
				<lb/>tion with nature, became sites for
				<lb/>healing rituals, prophecies, festivals
				<lb/>and pilgrimages. In time, villagers
				<lb/>who lived nearby constructed temples
				<lb/>to honor that female power which had
				<lb/>been channeled so generously through
				<lb/>such sites for their benefit. The tem
				<lb/>ples were not only abodes of the God
				<lb/>dess but also simulated her body or
				<lb/>womb. Her temples induced her pres
				<lb/>ence and in all probability people felt
				<lb/>that she actually directed their con
				<lb/>struction much as an artist today may
				<lb/>feel directed in the fabrication of a
				<lb/>work. Thus it may be said that the
				<lb/>temples of the Great Goddess give us
				<lb/>a record of how she manifested her
				<lb/>self. Certainly they show how she was
				<lb/>seen by people in ancient times and
				<lb/>how she evolved in different cultures.
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb/>We can think of the Goddess’s sanc
				<lb/>tuaries as weaving around the Earth a
				<lb/>network of psychic and natural forces
				<lb/>conjoined for all time at the nodes
				<lb/>where her temples were constructed.
				<lb/>Unfortunately, large sections of this
				<lb/>precious fabric have been destroyed.
				<lb/>One main way that patriarchal rulers
				<lb/>imposed their authority was by usurp
				<lb/>ing the Goddess's earthly power
				<lb/>nodes, destroying her temples and
				<lb/>erecting their own monuments. Many
				<lb/>of these late temples, dedicated to
				<lb/>patriarchal religions, still stand as
				<lb/>"navels of the world." Much research
				<lb/>and excavation must be done to un
				<lb/>earth this superimposition in order to
				<lb/>reveal the original matriarchal stra
				<lb/>tum.
				<lb/>But the temples of the Great God
				<lb/>dess are not merely historical relics.
				<lb/>Like the rituals from which they
				<lb/>evolved they are living archetypes in
				<lb/>our minds today. As models of eternal
				<lb/>structures of consciousness, they can
				<lb/>help us unravel the patriarchal overlay
				<lb/>in our own psyches that has hidden
				<lb/>our original source of wholeness and
				<lb/>power. Most exciting is that these and
				<lb/>other archetypes are spontaneously
				<lb/>reemerging in the works of contem
				<lb/>porary artists and architects and in
				<lb/>women’s visions for transforming the
				<lb/>fabric of our lives, our society and our
				<lb/>civilization.
				<lb/>It was difficult to select from the
				<lb/>thousands of Goddess temples in the
				<lb/>world only eighteen to show here,
				<lb/>but this small sample represents the
				<lb/>range of temples that were built tothe
				<lb/>Great Goddess starting with primitive
				<lb/>sanctuaries of the Earth Mother and
				<lb/>culminating in sophisticated urban
				<lb/>temples to the Queen of Heaven.

				<lb/>1. Catal Huyuk Shrine, Anatolia.
				<lb/>Ca. 5700 B.C.
				<lb/>In the compact, multileveled Neo
				<lb/>lithic town of Catal Huyuk, 40 of the
				<lb/>139 buildings excavated were shrines.
				<lb/>They were similar to the houses but
				<lb/>larger and richer in artwork. Many
				<lb/>images of the Goddess showed her
				<lb/>flanked by two leopards as if they sup
				<lb/>ported her during childbirth. In shrines
				<lb/>like the one shown here, wall reliefs
				<lb/>depicted the Goddess in a childbirth
				<lb/>posture with bulls’ heads below her
				<lb/>an archetypal representation of the
				<lb/>Goddess giving birth to the lunar bull.
				<lb/>The Goddess’s upraised arms repeat
				<lb/>the form of the bull's horns, a magical
				<lb/>gesture common to later Near Eastern
				<lb/>figures. In Egypt, the symbolic horns
				<lb/>were linked to the ever-important
				<lb/>Cow Goddess Hathor. At Catal Huyuk
				<lb/>concentric rings were drawn over the
				<lb/>womb of the birth-giving Goddess
				<lb/>suggesting a primordial origin of the
				<lb/>labyrinth. Breasts sculpted on walls
				<lb/>transformèd some shrines into sym
				<lb/>bols of the body of the Goddess.
				<lb/>Some of the breast sculptures con
				<lb/>tained vulture beaks and skulls. In
				<lb/>actual practice the bones of the dead
				<lb/>were probably picked clean by vul
				<lb/>tures before they were buried in the
				<lb/>shrines. The breasts show that this
				<lb/>process was part of the continuous
				<lb/>cycle of life, death and rebirth that
				<lb/>was the realm of the Great Goddess.

				<lb/>2. Shrine of Sabatinovka, Soviet
				<lb/>Moldavia. Ca. 4500 B.C.
				<lb/>This temple from the Neolithic
				<lb/>Cucuteni or Tripolye culture of Old
				<lb/>Europe, described in Marija Gim
				<lb/>butas's The Cods and Coddesses of
				<lb/>Old Europe, contained objects typ
				<lb/>ically symbolic of the Goddess
				<lb/>especially the Horns of Consecration
				<lb/>and the serpent. A total of thirty-two
				<lb/>clay female figurines was found
				<lb/>of them are schematically rendered
				<lb/>with fat thighs and a snake-shaped
				<lb/>head. A few were perforated through
				<lb/>the shoulders, but have no arms ex
				<lb/>cept one who holds a baby snake or
				<lb/>phallus, Gimbutas writes. In addi
				<lb/>tion, there was a large horned throne,
				<lb/>presumably for the presiding priestess,
				<lb/>and a large oven. To Gimbutas, "the
				<lb/>association of quemn and grindstone.
				<lb/>with figurines portrayed in a seated
				<lb/>position suggests magical grinding of
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb/>grain and then perhaps baking of
				<lb/>sacred bread.
				<lb/>4. Horns of Consecration, Palace of
				<lb/>Knossos. Crete. 2000-1450 B.C.
				<lb/>One of the highest civilizations of
				<lb/>the ancient world flourished on Crete
				<lb/>until about 1400 B.C. The important
				<lb/>architectural remains consist of sev
				<lb/>eral fabulous so-called palaces and
				<lb/>hundreds of tholos tombs. The pal
				<lb/>aces are free of signs of despotic
				<lb/>power, and the lack of defensive for
				<lb/>tifications in Cretan architecture in
				<lb/>dicates a lack of tyranny or military
				<lb/>tension; this was a civilization that
				<lb/>managed to achieve luxury without
				<lb/>armed might. The palaces do display
				<lb/>innovations that ensured a com
				<lb/>fortable, sensuous environment:
				<lb/>beautiful frescoes, sophisticated
				<lb/>water and drainage systems (inven
				<lb/>tions often attributed to the Romans),
				<lb/>multi-storied apartments with light
				<lb/>wells and extensive temple repos
				<lb/>itories. That Cretan civilization was
				<lb/>Goddess-centered is undisputed. Its
				<lb/>Serpent Goddesses, sacred bulls,
				<lb/>labrys’ or double axes, Horns of con
				<lb/>secration and fabled labyrinth are
				<lb/>now prime symbols of Goddess wor-
				<lb/>ship against which the artifacts of
				<lb/>other cultures are measured.
				<lb/>On Crete, the Goddess was first
				<lb/>worshipped in the huge natural caves
				<lb/>in sacred horned mountains like
				<lb/>Mount Ida, Mount Jouctas and Mount
				<lb/>Dikte. These continued to be used for
				<lb/>sacred rituals and to be frequented
				<lb/>sanctuaries even at the height of
				<lb/>Cretan civilization. In The Earth, The
				<lb/>Temple, and The Cods, architectural
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb/>h'storian Vincent Scully maintains
				<lb/>tnat not even the palaces were of
				<lb/>greatest architectural importance on
				<lb/>Crete. He believes that their siting in
				<lb/>the landscape was more important.
				<lb/>Typically each temple, here as well as
				<lb/>throughout Greece, was built in an
				<lb/>enclosed valley and aligned on a
				<lb/>north/south axis to have a view across
				<lb/>the valley of a conical hill, and be
				<lb/>yond that, to a horned or double
				<lb/>peaked mountain that contained a
				<lb/>cave sanctuary. At the Palace of
				<lb/>Knossos these features were sited/
				<lb/>sighted through the Horns of Con
				<lb/>secration. The proper siting of the
				<lb/>palace accentuated the meaning of
				<lb/>the landscape as the body of the God
				<lb/>dess. The valley was her encircling
				<lb/>arms; the conical hill, her breast or
				<lb/>nurturing function; the horned moun
				<lb/>tain, her "lap" or cleft vulva, the
				<lb/>Earth’s active power; and the cave
				<lb/>sanctuary, her birth-giving womb.

				<lb/>6. Hal Tarxien Temple, Malta,
				<lb/>approach to the Holy of Holies
				<lb/>The impressive temples on the Is
				<lb/>land of Malta are the most complex
				<lb/>structures to have survived among a
				<lb/>vast system of prehistoric megalithic
				<lb/>monuments dedicated to the Goddess
				<lb/>(see. The Realm of the Creat Coddess
				<lb/>by Sibylle von Cles-Reden and The
				<lb/>Silbury Treasure by Michael Dames).
				<lb/>The Maltese temples take the form of
				<lb/>the body of the Goddess more clearly
				<lb/>than do any other temples. Colossal
				<lb/>and diminutive statues found in the
				<lb/>temples show that the Goddess wor
				<lb/>shipped there had the same shape as
				<lb/>her temples—ample, rounded, gen
				<lb/>erous; thus entrance into any of these
				<lb/>temples was tantamount to entering
				<lb/>the Goddess for physical and spiritual
				<lb/>rebirth. The sanctuaries were con
				<lb/>structed of huge stones using methods
				<lb/>similar to those at Stonehenge. There
				<lb/>is reason to believe that there were
				<lb/>other cross-cultural influences, as the
				<lb/>ubiquitous serpentine spiral carvings
				<lb/>that dominate the entrances to the
				<lb/>Maltese temples, and which may sym
				<lb/>bolize the telluric serpent, are alsc
				<lb/>prominent in European passage graves
				<lb/>and on Neolithic pottery. Revised dat
				<lb/>ings of European and Maltese mega
				<lb/>lithic monuments based on corrected
				<lb/>radio-carbon and tree-ring chronol
				<lb/>ogies have overturned the orthodox
				<lb/>view that these monuments resulted
				<lb/>from the diffusion of "superior
				<lb/>Mesopotamian, Egyptian or Mycenae
				<lb/>an cultures, and have shown that
				<lb/>these structures preceded similar de
				<lb/>velopments in the East. The Maltese
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb/>temples, so clearly dedicated to the
				<lb/>Great Goddess, have been largely ig
				<lb/>nored and the finds distorted. As re
				<lb/>cently as November, 1977, the Great
				<lb/>Goddess of Malta was described in
				<lb/>National Ceographic simply as the
				<lb/>headless fat lady.

				<lb/>7. Stonehenge and its geospiral.
				<lb/>Begun ca. 2200 B.C.
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb/>8. Silbury Hill, England. Ca. 2700 B.C.
				<lb/>Stonehenge was the culmination of
				<lb/>a vast system of stone circles, wood
				<lb/>henges, earthworks and megalithic
				<lb/>monuments that were first built
				<lb/>around 4000 B.C. by agrarian peoples
				<lb/>in Western Europe, Iberia, Scan
				<lb/>dinavia and the British Isles. Some
				<lb/>what similar systems were eventually
				<lb/>built throughout the Mediterranean,
				<lb/>Eastern Europe, the Near East, Asia
				<lb/>Oceania and the Americas. Male
				<lb/>archaeologists were quick to assume
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb/>that all such works were the products
				<lb/>of patriarchal societies, and indeed
				<lb/>some mounds in some places en
				<lb/>tombed the remains of important
				<lb/>chieftains. Discoveries of the mathe
				<lb/>matical and astronomical significance
				<lb/>of monuments like Stonehenge rein
				<lb/>forced the idea that they were built by
				<lb/>a Sky-Father-logos-oriented priest
				<lb/>hood. But now there is mounting
				<lb/>evidence that Stonehenge and the en
				<lb/>tire megalithic system also mapped
				<lb/>the Earth’s telluric currents, named for
				<lb/>the Roman Earth Goddess Tellus. (See
				<lb/>John Michell’s books). These currents
				<lb/>are spiraling and linear configurations
				<lb/>in the Earth’s magnetic field produced
				<lb/>by terrestrial magma, subterranean
				<lb/>watercourses, the rotation and revolu
				<lb/>tion of the Earth, and the influence of
				<lb/>the sun, moon, planets and cosmic
				<lb/>particles. Agricultural communities
				<lb/>are particularly dependent upon these
				<lb/>forces since they not only determine
				<lb/>the weather but also profoundly affect
				<lb/>the fecundity of the land. Detailed
				<lb/>surveys of the telluric currents at
				<lb/>Stonehenge and other megalithic sites
				<lb/>were described by the dowser Guy
				<lb/>Underwood in The Pattern of the Past.
				<lb/>Among the currents that Underwood
				<lb/>mapped at Stonehenge was the geo
				<lb/>spiral around the altar stone that
				<lb/>delineated the magnetic field of a
				<lb/>strong subterranean spring. Such
				<lb/>"blind springs" were vital to both
				<lb/>animals and humans because they
				<lb/>had healing properties and affected
				<lb/>fertility. They are related to the sacred
				<lb/>springs of the Goddess found the
				<lb/>world over.

			<pb n='35'/>
			<p>
				<lb/>Stonehenge was built in several
				<lb/>stages. First to be constructed was the
				<lb/>outer ring of fifty-six Aubrey holes
				<lb/>that predicted an 18.6-year cycle of
				<lb/>lunar orbits and eclipses. Correlations
				<lb/>among the moon, menstruation,
				<lb/>blood, water and tides, fertility, birth
				<lb/>and the Goddess are primordial wom
				<lb/>en’s mysteries, and it is likely that
				<lb/>Stonehenge’s Aubrey holes came out
				<lb/>of this matriarchal tradition. Their tel
				<lb/>luric significance may lie in the fact
				<lb/>that lunar eclipses cause demon
				<lb/>strable disturbances in the Earth's
				<lb/>magnetic field. Zoologists have found
				<lb/>that extreme disturbances in the
				<lb/>Earth’s field, such as the periodic re
				<lb/>versal of poles, cause the total extinc
				<lb/>tion of many small species of life. The
				<lb/>Aubrey holes may have helped to pre
				<lb/>dict such subtle organic processes of
				<lb/>life and death.
				<lb/>Women wise in the ways of Wicca
				<lb/>intuitively knew that stone circles
				<lb/>marked magic circles, that stone align
				<lb/>ments facilitated the observation of
				<lb/>the eight sabbats, and that earth
				<lb/>mounds represented the body of the
				<lb/>Great Goddess. This intuition is sup
				<lb/>ported by evidence recently published
				<lb/>(in Michael Dames’s The Silbury
				<lb/>Treasure: The Creat Coddess Redis
				<lb/>covered) that England’s Silbury Hill,
				<lb/>which stands near Stonehenge and is
				<lb/>the largest prehistoric structure in all
				<lb/>Europe, was built not as a tomb of a
				<lb/>king but as the life-giving womb and
				<lb/>all-seeing eye of the Great Goddess.
				<lb/>The practice of building or visiting
				<lb/>harvest hills to celebrate the First
				<lb/>Fruits Festival of Lammas still survives
				<lb/>today in some farming communities
				<lb/>on the British Isles.

				<lb/>10. Labyrinth, Notre Dame de
				<lb/>Chartres, France. Twelfth,
				<lb/>thirteenth centuries A.D.
				<lb/>The fact that Trinity Chapel is a struc
				<lb/>ture having the same plan as the mega
				<lb/>lithic monuments at Woodhenge and
				<lb/>Stonehenge, and was laid out using the
				<lb/>same design principles, lends credence
				<lb/>to the assumption that the chapel and
				<lb/>corona were raised over pagan founda
				<lb/>tions. (Lyle Borst and Barbara Borst,
				<lb/>Megalithic Software, pp. 18-19.)
				<lb/>That cathedral apses evolved from
				<lb/>the cave sanctuaries of the Goddess is
				<lb/>quite certain, but recent evidence
				<lb/>shows that many English cathedral
				<lb/>apses or "Lady Chapels” also reflect
				<lb/>the distinctive egg/womb shape of
				<lb/>henge monuments like Stonehenge
				<lb/>and Woodhenge. The Borsts’ drawing
				<lb/>shows the geometry of the henge
				<lb/>foundation at Canterbury including
				<lb/>part of the pentagram that had to be
				<lb/>constructed in order to lay out the ir
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb/>regular circles. The pentagram was
				<lb/>apparently a fundamental geometric
				<lb/>principle of megalithic architecture
				<lb/>from Malta to the British Isles, and
				<lb/>may have been a precursor of the pen
				<lb/>tagram of witchcraft.
				<lb/>According to Henry Adams in
				<lb/>Mont-Saint-Michel &amp; Chartres, the
				<lb/>great French Gothic cathedrals were
				<lb/>built during a time when the cult of
				<lb/>the Virgin Mary” was burgeoning,
				<lb/>when French queens were powerful,
				<lb/>when women participated quite fully
				<lb/>in medieval society (there are records
				<lb/>of payments to female quarry owners
				<lb/>and to women laborers who took part
				<lb/>in building the cathedrals), and when
				<lb/>European culture was being fertilized
				<lb/>by passionate pagan legends dressed
				<lb/>up as the literature of courtly love.
				<lb/>In silent testimony to their matrilineal
				<lb/>origins, nearly all French Gothic
				<lb/>cathedrals had a stone labyrinth pat
				<lb/>tern in the floors of their naves. Most
				<lb/>of the labyrinths were removed during
				<lb/>the super-rational Age of Enlighten
				<lb/>ment; however, the one at Chartres
				<lb/>has survived.
				<lb/>11. Ziggurat in the Eanna at Erech,
				<lb/>Sumer. Third millennium B.C.
				<lb/>A crumbling mound is nearly all
				<lb/>that remains of Eanna, the complex
				<lb/>temple precinct in the once great city
				<lb/>of Erech (Uruk). Eanna was the most
				<lb/>important of several sacred centers of
				<lb/>Inanna, the Sumerian Queen of Heav
				<lb/>en (Ishtar in Babylon). It was in Eanna
				<lb/>that the earliest writing was discovered
				<lb/>— records dated before 3000 B.C. kept
				<lb/>by scribe priestesses who managed the
				<lb/>extensive business and real estate
				<lb/>holdings of the temple. (see When
				<lb/>God Was A Woman by Merlin Stone).
				<lb/>writings
				<lb/>describing
				<lb/>Later
				<lb/>Inanna’s Sacred Marriage Rite (see
				<lb/>S.N. Kramer) are among the most tru
				<lb/>ly erotic poems ever written and pre
				<lb/>figure Solomon’s Song of Songs. This
			</p>
			<pb n='36'/>
			<p>
				<lb/>rite occurred at the New Year when
				<lb/>Inanna, or her priestess surrogate,
				<lb/>copulated with the king making him
				<lb/>her consort, Dumuzi, thereby bestow-
				<lb/>ing on him power to rule as king.
				<lb/>Inanna as the Queen of Heaven was
				<lb/>the supreme source of power, and her
				<lb/>union with the king took place at the
				<lb/>summit of the world mountain in the
				<lb/>temple atop the ziggurat.
				<lb/>References to Inanna's temples in
				<lb/>the story of her descent into the
				<lb/>netherworld give us another indica
				<lb/>tion of her power. When she descend
				<lb/>ed, wanting to be Queen of the “Great
				<lb/>Below" as well as Queen of the “Great
				<lb/>Above, she is described as abandon
				<lb/>ing heaven, earth and seven of her
				<lb/>major temples, and fastening the
				<lb/>seven me to her side. The me were all
				<lb/>important to Sumerians as "the divine
				<lb/>rules and regulations that keep the
				<lb/>universe operating as planned.
				<lb/>(Kramer, p. 167.) Elsewhere Inanna is
				<lb/>named as “Queen of all the me." The
				<lb/>naming of Inanna’s seven temples and
				<lb/>her mastery of the seven me suggest
				<lb/>power over the seven visible "planets
				<lb/>which were believed to regulate the
				<lb/>entire universe and course of human
				<lb/>events. This belief was the accepted
				<lb/>cosmological theory until the Renais
				<lb/>sance, and even today it figures in
				<lb/>astrology and in the yogic chakra sys
				<lb/>tem. The seven temples of Inanna
				<lb/>were probably a symbolic architec
				<lb/>tural representation on Earth of the
				<lb/>order of the Universe above. Queen
				<lb/>of Heaven Inanna was indeed!
				<lb/>12. Temple of Isis, Philae, Egypt.
				<lb/>Fourth to second centuries B.C.
				<lb/>The tiny island of Philae, near the
				<lb/>First Cataract of Aswan on the Nile,
				<lb/>was long a sanctuary for travelers;
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb/>dedicatory inscriptions on nearby
				<lb/>rocks date from as early as 2280 B.C.
				<lb/>This great center of healing was cov
				<lb/>ered with temples dedicated to var
				<lb/>ious divinities, the most important of
				<lb/>which was Isis. Nubian inscriptions
				<lb/>mention the oracles of Isis which had
				<lb/>for centuries been revealed through
				<lb/>dreams to those who slept in the great
				<lb/>rock pylon temple (see Jayne, The
				<lb/>Healing Cods of Ancient Civiliza
				<lb/>tions, pp. 30, 67). This temple was
				<lb/>said to be the most beautiful Iseum in
				<lb/>all of Egypt. Philae became the fore
				<lb/>most center of Isis worship in the
				<lb/>ancient world, and by Ptolemaic
				<lb/>times was the principal holy site of
				<lb/>Egypt.
				<lb/>The protected island was the last
				<lb/>stronghold of Goddess worship after
				<lb/>Christian Rome either sealed of
				<lb/>destroyed all the pagan temples in the
				<lb/>Empire. In the mid-fifth century A.D.
				<lb/>a local Nubian tribe still continuec
				<lb/>their ancient annual tradition of trans
				<lb/>porting the temple’s sacred image of
				<lb/>Isis by boat to the fertile hills on the
				<lb/>opposite shore where she presidec
				<lb/>over their harvest rites (see R.E. Witt,
				<lb/>Isis in the Craeco-Roman World, p.
				<lb/>62). It is no surprise then that Philae
				<lb/>continued to be a sanctuary for Nu
				<lb/>bians and desert peoples until the
				<lb/>modern reservoir created by the
				<lb/>Aswan Dam submerged the island and
				<lb/>the nearby ancestral homelands of the
				<lb/>relatively matriarchal Nubians.
				<lb/>first structure to be saved from the
				<lb/>threatening dam system was, of
				<lb/>course, Abu Simbel, the pompous
				<lb/>monument of the despotic pharaoh
				<lb/>Ramesses II, but work is now under
				<lb/>way to dismantle the Temple of Isis
				<lb/>which will be rebuilt on the island of
				<lb/>Agilkia 500 yards away.

				<lb/>13. The Zodiac of Dendera
				<lb/>14. Egyptian Drawing of the Temple
				<lb/>of Dendera as the Horns of
				<lb/>Consecration
				<lb/>The great Temple of Dendera was
				<lb/>built very late in Egyptian civilization
				<lb/>and was dedicated to Hathor. As one
				<lb/>of the most enduring of Goddesses
				<lb/>Hathor was first worshipped as the
				<lb/>lunar cow at a time in prehistory when
				<lb/>animals were revered more than hu
				<lb/>mans. The structures surrounding her
				<lb/>temple, while by no means unique to
				<lb/>Dendera, retain some undying matri
				<lb/>lineal associations. They include a
				<lb/>sacred lake, a building for divine heal
				<lb/>ing, two birth houses, two wells and a
				<lb/>small temple of Isis. By late pharaonic
				<lb/>times most large temples, whether
				<lb/>dedicated to goddesses or gods, had
				<lb/>these features and all were imbued
				<lb/>with magical, mythological and polit
				<lb/>ical significance. For instance the
				<lb/>birth houses celebrated the holy birth
				<lb/>of the pharaoh and sanctioned her or
				<lb/>his divine authority to rule. This was
				<lb/>usually shown through images of the
				<lb/>pharaoh suckling Hathor’s udders.
				<lb/>Through her milk, Hathor bestowed
				<lb/>the power and life-sustenance that
				<lb/>was the matrix of the universe. By the
				<lb/>time Dendera was built, the image of
				<lb/>the suckling king had probably been
				<lb/>subverted politically to maintain the
				<lb/>surface myth of matrilineal royal
				<lb/>descent while actually strengthening
				<lb/>the power of an evolving patriarchal
				<lb/>order.
				<lb/>The enduring testimony of Hathor’s
				<lb/>worship provides a valuable transi
				<lb/>tional record that can greatly aid at
				<lb/>tempts to restore women’s heritage.
				<lb/>For example, the drawing of the Tem
				<lb/>ple of Dendera as the Horns of Con
				<lb/>secration with Hathor ascending on
				<lb/>the horizon bathed in the solar rays
				<lb/>emanating from the Sky Goddess Nut,
				<lb/>is rich in universal Goddess imagery.
				<lb/>The Horns of Consecration recall the
			</p>
			<pb n='37'/>
			<p>
				<lb/>horns of Catal Huyuk, Sabatinovka,
				<lb/>Beycesultan, Knossos, and even of
				<lb/>Sumer where early temples are shown
				<lb/>with horns and the sacred crown con
				<lb/>sisted of tiers of horns (the tiers being
				<lb/>related to the levels of the ziggurats
				<lb/>and possibly to the yogic conception
				<lb/>of chakra-levels of consciousness).
				<lb/>Hathor’s horns may also be arche
				<lb/>typally related to Paleolithic moon/
				<lb/>menstruation/blood/bull mysteries
				<lb/>and to some of the earliest art ever
				<lb/>produced, such as that found in the
				<lb/>Hall of Bulls at Lascaux, France.
				<lb/>Of interest at Dendera are the many
				<lb/>Hathor-headed columns in the Great
				<lb/>Vestibule. There are two sets of nine
				<lb/>columns, each surmounted by four
				<lb/>Hathor-heads which face in the four
				<lb/>directions and symbolize universal
				<lb/>power. (Unfortunately every single
				<lb/>head was mutilated long ago by
				<lb/>Christian fanatics.) The famous Zodi
				<lb/>ac of Dendera and other celestial
				<lb/>maps and symbols decorated the tem
				<lb/>ple ceilings to honor Hathor as the
				<lb/>Celestial Cow. The Zodiac was com
				<lb/>plete with all the astrological signs
				<lb/>still in use today, and its precise orien
				<lb/>tation helped to date the temple be
				<lb/>cause of the axial shift occasioned by
				<lb/>the precession of the equinoxes.

			<p>
				<lb/>15. Eleusis with the Plutonium,
				<lb/>Greece. First millennium B.C.
				<lb/>Eleusis was the site of the great
				<lb/>temple and altar that Demeter com
				<lb/>manded to be built to teach her rites
				<lb/>and to reveal the secrets of immor
				<lb/>tality. It was also the site where she
				<lb/>was reunited with her daughter Perse
				<lb/>phone, who had been abducted into
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb/>the underworld by Hades and who re
				<lb/>emerged through the Plutonium cave.
				<lb/>The nine day cycle of the Eleusinian
				<lb/>Mysteries, during which the myths of
				<lb/>Demeter and Persephone were prob
				<lb/>ably reenacted, was the center of
				<lb/>Greek religious life for centuries.
				<lb/>Though thousands were initiated into
				<lb/>the mysteries each year, they were
				<lb/>sworn to strictest secrecy. Even today
				<lb/>little is known about the rites. What
				<lb/>few facts have been deduced do not
				<lb/>adequatley reveal the true emotional
				<lb/>and spiritual power that made the
				<lb/>Eleusinian Mysteries so revered.
				<lb/>Though no details of the rites were
				<lb/>ever written down, there were ref
				<lb/>erences to their effects in the Homeric
				<lb/>Hymns and other writings. Various
				<lb/>scholars have speculated that the
				<lb/>Mysteries created a sense of bliss by
				<lb/>revealing the biological, agricultural
				<lb/>and spiritual continuity of life. At a
				<lb/>time when patriarchy was omnip-
				<lb/>otent, the Eleusinian Mysteries reab
				<lb/>sorbed people into the great round of
				<lb/>natural matrilineal cycles. Over the
				<lb/>centuries the temple was expanded
				<lb/>several times to accommodate elab
				<lb/>orations in the rites and the growing
				<lb/>numbers of initiates; however, like all
				<lb/>pagan sanctuaries, Eleusis was even
				<lb/>tually destroyed by Christians. Today
				<lb/>only the ruins of Demeter’s great tem
				<lb/>ple remain as one of the precious few
				<lb/>records of her Mysteries.
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb/>16. Oracle of Delphi, Greece.
				<lb/>First millennium B.C.
				<lb/>Long before the influential oracular
				<lb/>site of Delphi was seized by Apollo, it
				<lb/>was a sacred part of the body of the
				<lb/>Earth Mother Gaea. From a seismic
				<lb/>cleft in this "body of Gaea, exuded
				<lb/>intoxicating gases that induced pro
			</p>
			<pb n='38'/>
			<p>
				<lb/>phetic visions. Apollo killed the great
				<lb/>Python, protector of the site; there
				<lb/>after Pythia, the priestess who pro
				<lb/>nounced the prophecies, spoke for
				<lb/>Apollo rather than Gaea. The original
				<lb/>site now lies buried beneath Apollo’s
				<lb/>temple.
				<lb/>The theme of male gods and heroes
				<lb/>slaying serpents or dragons to gain
				<lb/>control of matriarchal realms is uni
				<lb/>versal in mythology. The serpent is
				<lb/>usually interpreted as a symbol of un
				<lb/>conscious instinctual drives that must
				<lb/>be conquered to achieve human
				<lb/>consciousness, but other interpreta
				<lb/>tions are possible. Merlin Stone
				<lb/>argues in When Cod Was a Woman
				<lb/>that the serpent may have been an aid
				<lb/>to prophecy. She cites a recent study
				<lb/>showing that people who have been
				<lb/>immunized by gradual exposure to
				<lb/>snake-bite do not die when bitten by a
				<lb/>venomous serpent, but rather experi
				<lb/>ence prophetic psychedelic visions.
				<lb/>We could conclude that the male
				<lb/>heroes were slaying the visionary fem
				<lb/>inine imagination (i.e. the Python) in
				<lb/>order to impose the rational mas
				<lb/>culine mind (i.e. Apollo).
				<lb/>Another interpretation is that the
				<lb/>serpent-slayer myth encapsulates a
				<lb/>long and bloody conflict between the
				<lb/>indigenous Aegean Stone and Bronze
				<lb/>Age matriarchal culture, which fo
				<lb/>cused on living in harmony with the
				<lb/>Earth’s telluric currents (symbolized
				<lb/>by the serpent), and the invading
				<lb/>patriarchal Indo-European culture,
				<lb/>which virtually worshipped metal
				<lb/>(symbolized by the serpent-slayer).
				<lb/>The Indo-Europeans were crude iron
				<lb/>workers and warriors. They wor
				<lb/>shipped a god of volcanic mountains,
				<lb/>and their most esteemed citizen was
				<lb/>the blacksmith. Horse-drawn chariots
				<lb/>and iron weapons made them for
				<lb/>midable conquerors, and wherever
				<lb/>they went, from Europe to India, their
				<lb/>assimilation marked the beginning of
				<lb/>the Iron Age. According to dowsers,
				<lb/>ferrous metals nullify all sensitivity to
				<lb/>the telluric currents. The serpent
				<lb/>slayer myth, then, could be a vivid
				<lb/>image of the destruction of the whole
				<lb/>matriarchal way of life. It encodes the
				<lb/>earliest instances of the contempt for
				<lb/>nature that has become so much a
				<lb/>part of the patriarchy’s technological
				<lb/>imperative— and such an anathema to
				<lb/>the female soul.
				<lb/>17. The Parthenon, reconstruction
				<lb/>of Athene’s Statue, Greece.
				<lb/>447-432 B.C.
				<lb/>The Parthenon is the most celebrat
				<lb/>ed Goddess temple in the world. Jewel
				<lb/>of the Acropolis, it epitomized the
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb/>glory of Athens, Athene’s city, and the
				<lb/>whole of the classical world. For 2500
				<lb/>years it has remained the architectural
				<lb/>ideal of Western civilization. The Par
				<lb/>thenon was named for and dedicated
				<lb/>to Athene Parthenos. Parthenos,
				<lb/>meaning "virgin” as in parthenogen
				<lb/>esis, “virgin birth"), traditionally did
				<lb/>not mean "celibate” but rather, un
				<lb/>married, complete-in-herself, self
				<lb/>creating. A virgin gave birth to her
				<lb/>self, not babies, and to culture. Plato
				<lb/>alluded to this when he said that those
				<lb/>who are pregnant in the body give
				<lb/>birth to children; those who are preg
				<lb/>nant in the soul give birth to culture.
				<lb/>Because Athene had always been a
				<lb/>virgin culture-bearer as opposed to a
				<lb/>wifely child-bearer, the Indo-Europe
				<lb/>ans could not convincingly domes
				<lb/>ticate her, as they had the other god
				<lb/>desses, by marrying her to Zeus. Final
				<lb/>ly, through the ingenious contrivance
				<lb/>of making her Zeus’s daughter, born
				<lb/>from his head, they corrupted her to
				<lb/>serve their ends. She was turned into a
				<lb/>Goddess of War who sanctioned
				<lb/>bloody battles against even her own
				<lb/>sisters, the Amazons. She was por
				<lb/>trayed aiding all the heroes as they
				<lb/>slew the serpents, Gorgons and other
				<lb/>symbols of matriarchal order. Her
				<lb/>temple was absolutely devoid of
				<lb/>traditional Goddess imagery. Beauti
				<lb/>ful as it was, it had no caves, apses,
				<lb/>egg/wombs, or Horns of Consecration
				<lb/>—only rational mathematical pro
				<lb/>portions
				<lb/>A monumental statue of Athene
				<lb/>that has not survived dominated the
				<lb/>Parthenon. However, conjectural re
				<lb/>constructions of it show Athene with
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb/>the Gorgon’s head around her neck
				<lb/>like a trophy or psychological shadow.
				<lb/>Her great serpent, warrior's shield and
				<lb/>spear are at her side as references to
				<lb/>both the telluric serpent and lron Age
				<lb/>weapons, and in her hand she holds a
				<lb/>crystal ball. Her image could rep
				<lb/>resent either a true matriarchal God
				<lb/>dess or an anima figure—the symbol
				<lb/>of feminine consciousness as experi
				<lb/>enced by men. (This revised Athene
				<lb/>was, after all, born from Zeus’s head).
				<lb/>As overseer of the dominating tel
				<lb/>luric serpents and wearer of the Cor
				<lb/>gon’s head, Athene appears to repre
				<lb/>sent the spiritualization of telluric
				<lb/>or Kundalini energy. Kundalini sym
				<lb/>bolizes in Hindu philosophy the
				<lb/>serpent-energy of the Goddess who,
				<lb/>through a series of yogic exercises, is
				<lb/>made to ascend the spinal column to
				<lb/>elicit pure consciousness. The West
				<lb/>ern counterpart is the psychoanalyti
				<lb/>cal channeling of the contents of the
				<lb/>unconscious into consciousness to
				<lb/>achieve self-knowledge. As the self
				<lb/>creating Goddess of Wisdom, Athene
				<lb/>seems to combine the two traditions.
				<lb/>Pure consciousness (wisdom, self
				<lb/>knowledge) is symbolized in Tibetan
				<lb/>Buddhism by the “Jewel Ornament of
				<lb/>the Liberation” and in Chinese art by a
				<lb/>crystal in the claw of the telluric
				<lb/>dragon. Was it symbolized in classical
				<lb/>Greece by the crystal in Athene's
				<lb/>hand? And is the Parthenon’s pristine
				<lb/>geometry a monument to the minds
				<lb/>of the men who sapped Athene's
				<lb/>power or is it a monument to a form
				<lb/>of pure consciousness inherent in the
				<lb/>Great Goddess?
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb/>18. Ise Shrine, Japan.
				<lb/>685 A.D. or earlier
				<lb/>As the national shrine of Shintoism,
				<lb/>Ise is the most beloved sanctuary in
				<lb/>Japan. Far from being a monumental
				<lb/>stone structure, it is a simple, tiny
			</p>
			<pb n='39'/>
			<p>
				<lb/>group of buildings made of wood and
				<lb/>thatch. Strongly centered in Goddess
				<lb/>worship, Shintoism remains one of the
				<lb/>few nature-based religions in the
				<lb/>world today. The need to renew Ise's
				<lb/>nature spirits, as well as to preserve its
				<lb/>material structure, has resulted in one
				<lb/>of the most telling examples in the
				<lb/>history of architecture of human ded
				<lb/>ication to a shrine. Every twenty
				<lb/>years, from 685 A.D. to today, Ise has
				<lb/>been painstakingly dismantled and re
				<lb/>built on alternating sites. The recon
				<lb/>struction is so exact that the history of
				<lb/>Japanese religions from prehistoric to
				<lb/>modern times can be read in the struc
				<lb/>tures. Through studying Ise and the
				<lb/>rituals performed there now, scholars
				<lb/>have been able to reconstruct the
				<lb/>original rite. It consisted of “a priest
				<lb/>ess, worshipping beside a sacred
				<lb/>planted bough, which received the
				<lb/>guardian deity when she descended
				<lb/>from heaven. Sanctified at Ise are a
				<lb/>hill, a bush, water and stones, a
				<lb/>sacred mirror, [and) the sacred pillar,
				<lb/>which is half-buried beneath the floor
				<lb/>of the shrine.” (Masuda, p. 16)
				<lb/>The whole archetypal matriarchal
				<lb/>cycle from prehistory's Goddess of
				<lb/>Fertility to civilization's Queen of
				<lb/>Heaven, as well as the history of
				<lb/>Japanese religion, is compressed into
				<lb/>the two modest shrines at Ise. The
				<lb/>outer shrine, called the Gegü, is dedi
				<lb/>cated to Toyukehime, the Goddess of
				<lb/>Fertility and Grain—the primeval
				<lb/>Earth Mother. The inner shrine, called
				<lb/>the Naigü, is dedicated to Amaterasu,
				<lb/>the Sun Goddess who today em
				<lb/>blazons the Japanese flag and from
				<lb/>whom all Japanese emperors claimed
				<lb/>descent.

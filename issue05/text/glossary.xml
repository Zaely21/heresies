				<lb/>Glossary
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb/>Some words have been included in
				<lb/>this glossary to provide supplementary
				<lb/>information but primarily we wanted
				<lb/>to demonstrate what has been aptly
				<lb/>called “The Power of Naming" with
				<lb/>the intention of reclaiming it. We
				<lb/>could choose only a small percentage
				<lb/>of the words that speak powerfully of
				<lb/>our past and of our potential.
				<lb/>Our main sources were: Webster's
				<lb/>International Dictionary Unabridgec
				<lb/>First and Third Editions, the Oxford
				<lb/>Unabridged Dictionary and Liddell &amp;
				<lb/>Scott’s Greek-English Lexicon, A
				<lb/>bridged, Oxford University Press
				<lb/>aegis (Latin from Greek aigis, aiz ’goat
				<lb/>skin.') Leather pouch worn like an apron
				<lb/>by Cretan priestesses, custom probably
				<lb/>adopted from Libya, where until recen
				<lb/>times women wore leather pouches in
				<lb/>which they kept oracular snakes. Hence
				<lb/>the archaic ’to come under the shielding
				<lb/>apron of is in modern English ’to come
				<lb/>under the patronage, sponsorship, aus
				<lb/>pices."
				<lb/>Amazon (Greek Amazon; usually giver
				<lb/>as a ’without' + mazos breast.') Legend
				<lb/>records that Amazons removed their righ
				<lb/>breasts to facilitate the use of the bow and
				<lb/>arrow. However, Zonë (in the Thracian
				<lb/>language) meant ’a woman’s girdle”; by ex
				<lb/>tension 'marriage or the sexual act, the dis
				<lb/>robing of a woman." Hence, ama suggests
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb/>’something lacking' + zone = ’a woman
				<lb/>whose girdle remains unloosened.” Greek
				<lb/>mythology records that after Heracles
				<lb/>killed Hippolyta, a queen of the Amazons
				<lb/>he stole her girdle. Zonë also was the name
				<lb/>of the capitol city of the Amazons in an
				<lb/>cient Thrace, (modern Bulgaria-Romania
				<lb/>to the Aegean and Propontus coasts.) One
				<lb/>of a race or nation of female warriors usu
				<lb/>ally associated with Scythia or Asia Minor
				<lb/>with whom the ancient Greeks of mytholo-
				<lb/>gy repeatedly warred; a tall strong mas
				<lb/>culine woman, a virago. Also see: Parthian
				<lb/>Anat, Anath Goddess who gave her
				<lb/>name to ancient Anatolia (modern Turkey),
				<lb/>later revered in Canaan. Her worship was
				<lb/>suppressed and inveighed against in Bibli
				<lb/>cal times. Ana is a universal name given to
				<lb/>women in all cultures, meaning 'risen,
				<lb/>heavenly. See: anatheme
				<lb/>anathema (Greek from ana+thema
				<lb/>upon+law [god); usually given as any
				<lb/>thing set up.’) Hence, a thing consecrated
				<lb/>to divine use; a votive offering, which in
				<lb/>Late Latin became anything devoted to
				<lb/>evil, curse. See: Anath
				<lb/>apotropaism. The science and art ot pre
				<lb/>venting or overcoming evils, usually by in
				<lb/>cantation or a ritual act.
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb/>cereal (Latin cerealis from Ceres, God
				<lb/>dess of Grain, akin to crescere ’to grow.') A
				<lb/>plant yielding seeds suitable for food,
				<lb/>wheat, maize, rice. See: crescent
				<lb/>clitoridectomy Sexual mutilation of the
				<lb/>female genitals, the surgical practices of
				<lb/>which vary: 1) Excision of the clitoris, labia
				<lb/>minora and sometimes all external vaginal
				<lb/>genitalia. 2) Infibulation or Pharaonic cir
				<lb/>cumcision — After excision, labia are
				<lb/>scraped and sutured to close the female
				<lb/>introitus. This operation is usually per
				<lb/>formed on girls between the ages of four
				<lb/>and eight years to guarantee virginity. 3
				<lb/>Sunna circumcision—Removal of the pre
				<lb/>puce and tip of the clitoris, which must be
				<lb/>done by a skilled surgeon. Clitoridectomies
				<lb/>have been performed in hospitals through
				<lb/>out the world. In Moslem countries, wom
				<lb/>en of all classes are subjected to clitori
				<lb/>dectomies. The practice is sanctioned by
				<lb/>the Islamic religion.
				<lb/>crescent
				<lb/>(Latin crescere, creare ’to cre
				<lb/>ate, bring forth’; from Greek koros ’boy,
				<lb/>puppet; kore ’girl, virgin, pupil of th
				<lb/>eye.’) A heraldic charge that consists of
				<lb/>the figure of the crescent moon with the
				<lb/>horns directed upwards; the time between
				<lb/>the new and the full moon. See: cereal;
				<lb/>also myth of Kore and Demeter
				<lb/>crown (Latin from Greek korone ’any
				<lb/>thing curved,' skairein ’to dance'; Sanskrit
				<lb/>kridati ’she dances and plays.*) Basic
			</p>
			<pb n='129'/>

				<lb/>meaning: turning, bending. Probably re
				<lb/>lated to crescent and Kore.

				<lb/>wegian and Swedish dialects kunta, Mid
				<lb/>dle Low German kutte, all meaning’female
				<lb/>pudenda,' but in Middle High German
				<lb/>kotze ’pudenda' became ’prostitute.' Like
				<lb/>the English words, cot, cottage, cunt ap
				<lb/>pears to derive from Sanskrit khatya ’bed
				<lb/>stead, bier of Dravidian origin. The Dra
				<lb/>vidians were the indigenous goddess wor
				<lb/>shippers of India before the Brahmanic
				<lb/>conquest.
				<lb/>Dame, dame (Latin Domina ’woman
				<lb/>in authority, female head of family; re

				<lb/>Goth gatarhjan ’to mark,' Greek derkesthai

				<lb/>sayati ’she causes to see.“ The basic mean
				<lb/>ing is ’to see.') A woman who watche
				<lb/>vigilantly and fiercely over the welfare of
				<lb/>her charges.
				<lb/>devil (Greek diablos; dia Latin and
				<lb/>Greek for Goddess + Greek ballo ’to throw
				<lb/>over, slander, mislead, impose upon.’) The
				<lb/>temporal and spiritual adversary of god
				<lb/>although subordinate to him and able to
				<lb/>act only by his sufferance, frequently rep
				<lb/>resented as the leader of all apostate an
				<lb/>gels and as the ruler or hell. See: hell
				<lb/>(Greek gyneh ’woman"; related to
				<lb/>Greek gen meaning origin or beginning.
				<lb/>Both derived from Sanskrit Cna, the name
				<lb/>of a Goddess.) A prefix used to mean
				<lb/>knowledge as in gnomon or gnostic; later
				<lb/>developed into ’know’ from Latin gnoscere
				<lb/>to know.' See: queen

				<lb/>ticoat rule—usually disparaging.

				<lb/>(Old
				<lb/>hag
				<lb/>aegtesse, Old High
				<lb/>German hagzissa ’harpy, witch,' both from
				<lb/>a prehistoric Germanic compound whose
				<lb/>components are akin respectively to Old
				<lb/>English haga ’hedge’ and to Greek dialect
				<lb/>hagia ’holy.’) Female demon; an ugly re
				<lb/>pulsive old woman. In the British dialect
				<lb/>the word has many meanings: to goad; an
				<lb/>enclosed wooden area; the stroke of an ax,
				<lb/>also a wild female hawk or falcon who
				<lb/>preys for herself and is later caught when
				<lb/>in her adult plumage. Hence a wild person
				<lb/>(at first a female), one not to be captured
				<lb/>Therefore, a wise woman of independent
				<lb/>spirit. See: hedge
				<lb/>Halloween (Old English hallow’holy +
				<lb/>e’een ’eve.’) Hallowday is the first of No
				<lb/>vember (Christian All Saints’ Day.) The last
				<lb/>night of October is the Eve of All Hallows.
				<lb/>In the Old Celtic calendar the year began
				<lb/>on November 1, October 31 being ’Old
				<lb/>Year’s Night, the night of all witches. Hal
				<lb/>lowmas, the Celtic fire festival of Samhain,
				<lb/>marked the zenith between Autumnal E-
				<lb/>quinox (c. September 23) and Winter Sol
				<lb/>stice (c. December 21.) It is the Witches
				<lb/>New Year coming at the end of the harvest.
				<lb/>See: halo
				<lb/>halo (Creek alous ’threshing floor,' the
				<lb/>first hallowed place.) From alous comes
				<lb/>the name of the Greek Haloa festival, cel
				<lb/>ebrated in honor of Demeter and by wom
				<lb/>en only, featuring a harvest feast. A nim
				<lb/>bus of sacrality said to surround a person

				<lb/>with the fingers. See: crown, harpy
				<lb/>harpy (Greek harpazein ’to snatch’ as in
				<lb/>playing a harp, ’plucking with the fingers.“
				<lb/>One of a group of foul malign creatures
				<lb/>part woman-part bird, who seized the souls
				<lb/>of the wicked and punished evil-doers.
				<lb/>heal (Middle English helen, possibly re
				<lb/>lated to helan Old English root for ’hell';
				<lb/>from Coth hailijan the same root as ’holy,
				<lb/>healthy, whole.’) Etymology suggests that
				<lb/>the concepts and practices of healing de
				<lb/>rive from and may be named for the pre
				<lb/>Greek culture of the Helenes. See: heleni
				<lb/>um, Helladic
				<lb/>(Old Norse heithinn; Coth
				<lb/>heathen
				<lb/>haithno specifically ’heathen woman,

				<lb/>hedge
				<lb/>(Old High German hag ’hedge."
				<lb/>Hedged in enclosure; to modify a state
				<lb/>ment or position; to allow for contingen
				<lb/>cies; to avoid rigid commitment. As 'hag
				<lb/>means ’witch,' these connotations suggest
				<lb/>connections with the wiccian religion. See:
				<lb/>hag, wicca
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb/>helenium

				<lb/>from helene, akin to Creek helix, adj.

				<lb/>helix (Latin from Greek) Anything of
				<lb/>spiral shape. See: helenium
				<lb/>Hell (Originally Old English helan meant
				<lb/>to conceal'; possibly related to heal. In
				<lb/>Old Norse hel was defined as 'heathen."
				<lb/>Both related to Sanskrit sarana ’screen
				<lb/>ing.’) Place designated as the abode of the
				<lb/>dead in various religions. See: heal, hea
				<lb/>then
				<lb/>Helladic (Greek Helladikos) Of or relat

				<lb/>the same Asianic word as Isis ish-ish,
				<lb/>meaning ’she who weeps.") The powerful
				<lb/>Babylonian Goddess who, like Isis,
				<lb/>mourned the death of her annually slain
				<lb/>son-lover. See: Isis

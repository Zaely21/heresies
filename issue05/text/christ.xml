			<p>
				At the close of Ntosake Shange’s stupendously successful Broadway play For Colored Cirls Who Have Considered Suicide When the Rainbow Is Enuf, a tall beautiful
				Black woman rises from despair to cry out, &quot;l found God
				in myself and 1 loved her fiercely.”1 Her discovery is
				echoed by women around the country who meet spontaneously in small groups on full moons, solstices anc
				equinoxes to celebrate the Goddess as symbol of life and
				death powers and waxing and waning energies in the
				universe and in themselves.2</p>
				<p>It is the night of the full moon. Nine women stand in a
				circle, on a rocky hill above the city. The western sky i
				rosy with the setting sun; in the east the moon’s face begins
				to peer above the horizon. .. The woman pours a cup of
				wine onto the earth, refills it and raises it high. “Hail Tana,
				Mother of Mothers!&quot; she cries. &quot;Awaken from your long
				sleep, and return to your children again!&quot;3</p>
				<p>What are the political and psychological effects of this
				fierce new love of the divine in themselves on women
				whose previous spiritual experience has been focusec
				upon the male God of Judaism and Christianity? Is the
				spiritual dimension of feminism a passing diversion, an
				escape from difficult but necessary political work? Or
				does the emergence of the symbol of Goddess among
				women have significant political and psychological ramifications for the feminist movement?</p>
				<p>To answer these questions, we must first understand
				the importance of religious symbols and rituals in human
				life. According to anthropologist Clifford Geertz religious
				symbols shape a cultural ethos, defining the deepest
				values of a society and the persons in it. “Religion,
				Geertz writes, &quot;is a system of symbols which act to produce powerful, pervasive, and long-lasting moods and
				motivations”“ in the people of a given culture. A &quot;mood
				for Geertz is a psychological attitude such as awe, trust or
				respect, while a “motivation” is the social and political
				trajectory created by a mood which transforms mythos
				into ethos, symbol system into social and political reality.
				Symbols have both psychological and political effects because they create the inner conditions (deep-seated attitudes and féelings) which lead people to feel comfortable with or to accept social and political arrangements that correspond to the symbol system. Because
				religion has such a compelling hold on the deep psyches
				of so many people, feminists cannot afford to leave it in
				the hands of the fathers. Even people who no longer &quot;believe in God&quot; or participate in the institutional structure
				of patriarchal religion still may not be free of the power of
				the symbolism of God the Father. A symbol’s effect is not
				dependent on rational assent, for a symbol also functions
				on levels of the psyche other than the rational. Religion
				fulfills deep psychic needs by providing symbols and
			</p>
			<p>
				rituals which enable people to cope with difficult situations? in human life (e.g., death, evil, suffering) and to
				pass through life’s important transitions (e.g., birth, marriage, death). Even people who consider themselves completely secularized will often find themselves sitting in a
				church or synagogue when a friend or relative gets married, or when a parent or friend dies. The symbols associated with these important rituals cannot fail to affect the
				deep or unconscious structures of the mind of even a person who has rejected these symbolisms on a conscious
				level—especially if that person is under stress. The reason
				for the continuing effect of religious symbols is that the
				mind is uncomfortable with a vacuum. Symbol systems
				cannot simply be rejected, they must be replaced. I believe where there is no replacement, the mind will revert
				to familiar structures at times of crisis, bafflement or
				defeat</p>
				<p>Religions centered on the worship of a male God keep
				women in a childish state of psychological dependence
				on men and male authority, and at the same time legitimate the political and social authority of fathers and sons
				in the institutions of society. The damage done to women
				by exclusively male symbolism in religion and culture is
				both psychological and political: women feel their own
				power is inferior or dangerous and they therefore give
				over their will to male authority figures in family and
				society.</p>
				<p>Religious symbol systems focused on exclusively male
				images of divinity are psychologically devastating to
				women because they create the impression that female
				This message need never be explicitly stated (as for example it is in the story of Eve) for its effect to be felt. A
				woman completely ignorant of the myths of female evil in
				Biblical religion nonetheless acknowledges the anomaly
				of female power when she prays exclusively to a male
				God. She may see herself as like God (created in the
				image of God) by denying her own sexual identity and
				affirming God’s transcendence of sexual identity, but she
				can never have the experience which is freely available to
				every man and boy in her culture, of having her full sexual
				identity affirmed as being in the image and likeness of
				God. Her mood is one of trust in male power as salvific
				and distrust of female power in herself and other womer
				as inferior or dangerous. Such a &quot;powerful, pervasive, and
				long-lasting” mood cannot fail to become a motivation
				which translates into social and political reality.</p>
				<p>As Z Budapest has noted, the easiest way to conquer a
				people is through religion, because after the people internalize the symbols of a religion, they function as their
				own &quot;internal policemen” and force is no longer necessary
				to keep them in line.° The conquest of the psyche ensures
			</p>
			<pb n='9'/>
			<p>
				control of the body politic, as politicians as diverse as
				Hitler and Mao have known well.</p>
				<p>Feminist theologian Mary Daly has detailed the political ramifications of Father religion for women in Beyond
				God the Father:</p>
				<p>If God in “his&quot; heaven is a father ruling his people, then it
				is the &quot;nature” of things and according to divine plan and
				the order of the universe that society be male-dominated
				Within this context a mystification of roles takes place: the
				husband dominating his wite represents God “himself.&quot;
				The images and values of a given society have been projected into the realm of dogmas and “Articles of Faith,
				and these in turn justify the social structures which have
				given rise to them and which sustain their plausibility.</p>
				<p>The secular philosopher Simone de Beauvoir is well
				aware of the function of patriarchal religion as legitimater
				of male power:</p>
				<p>Man enjoys the great advantage of having a god endorse
				the code he writes; and since man exercises a sovereign
				authority over women it is especially fortunate that this
				authority has been vested in him by the Supreme Being.
				For the Jews, Mohammedans, and Christians, amongothers,
				man is Master by divine right; the fear of God will therefore
				repress any impulse to revolt in the downtrodden female.8</p>
				<p>The political consequences of patriarchal religion were
				evident to nineteenth-century suffragist Elizabeth Cady
				Stanton who came to view the churches as the single most
				potent force opposing female suffrage. Thus she brought
				together her now famous revising committee to write The
				Women’s Bible, an early feminist attempt to challenge
				directly the power of patriarchal religion</p>
				<p>This brief discussion of the psychological and political
				effects of God religion puts us in an excellent position to
				begin to understand the significance of the symbol of
				Goddess for women. But before proceeding to that discussion.
			</p>
			<p>
				let me briefly identify the sources for the symbolism of Goddess as it is reemerging in womanspirit and
				of traditions but their attitudes toward these traditions are
				eclectic and selective. Ancient traditions are filtered
				through modern experience and there is no sense that
				every aspect of ancient or culturally distant religious consciousness must be adopted as whole cloth.</p>
				<p>At the simplest and most basic level, the symbol of
				Goddess is an acknowledgment of the legitimacy of female power as a beneficent and independent power. A
				woman who echoes Ntosake Shange’s dramatic statement, &quot;I found God in myself and I loved her fiercely, is
				saying, &quot;Female power is strong and creative.” She is saying that the divine principle, the saving and sustaining
				power, is in herselt, that she will no longer look to men or
				male figures as saviors. This meaning of the symbol of
				Goddess is simple and obvious, and yet it is difficult for
				many to comprehend. It stands in sharp contrast to the
				paradigms of female dependence on males which have
				been predominant in our culture. The internationally acclaimed French novelist Monique Wittig captured something of the novelty and flavor of the affirmation of female power when she wrote in her mythic work Les
				Cuérillères:</p>
				<p>There was a time when you were not a slave, remember
				that. You walked alone, full of laughter, you bathed barebellied. You say you have lost all recollection of it, remember. .. you say there are no words to describe it, you say it
				does not exist. But remember. Make an effort to remember. Or, failing that, invent.9</p>
				<p>While Wittig does not speak directly of the Goddess, she
				nonetheless captures a sense of the mood created in
				women who define their identities through the symbol of
				Goddess. This mood is one of a joyous celebration of
				female freedom and independence, as well as a fearless
			</p>

			<p>
				affirmation of the female body, a 
				point discussed more fully below.</p>
				<p>The affirmation of female power contained in the symbol of Goddess has both psychological and political consequences. Psychologically it means the defeat of the internal policeman who reminds women that their power is
				inferior and dangerous. This new mood of affirmation of
				female power leads to new motivations; it supports and
				undergirds women&apos;s trust in their own power and the
				power of other women in family and society.</p>
				<p>have said that the simplest meaning of the symbo
				&quot;Goddess&quot; is an affirmation of the legitimacy and beneficence of female power. For one raised in the West, a
				question immediately arises, &quot;ls the Goddess simply female power writ large, and if so, why bother with the symbol ’Goddess’ at all? Or do you really mean to refer to a
				Goddess ’out there&apos; who is not reducible to a human
				potential?” Many women have rediscovered the power of
				Goddess in solitude as a result of their own inner quests,
				or with other women through the women’s spirituality
				movement; their answers to this question vary. Three
				meanings attach to the symbol &quot;Goddess” for these women: (1) the Goddess as divine female, as personification
				who can be invoked in prayer and ritual; (2) the Goddess
				as symbol of the life, death and rebirth energy in nature
				and culture, in personal and communal life; (3) the Goddess as affirmation of the legitimacy and beauty of female
				power (made possible by the new becoming of women in
				the women’s liberation movement). If one were to ask the
				women who participate in the symbol of Goddess which
				of these meanings is the &quot;correct” one, different responses
				would be given. Some would assert that the Goddess is
				definitely not “out there,” that the symbol of a divinity
				&quot;out there” is part of the legacy of patriarchal oppression,
				which brings with it the authoritarianism, hierarchicalism
				and dogmatic rigidity associated with Biblical monotheistic religions. They might argue that the symbol of
				Goddess reflects the sacred power within women and
				nature, suggesting the connectedness between women&apos;s
				cycles of menstruation, birth and menopause and the life
				and death cycles of the universe. Others seem quite comfortable with the notion of Goddess as a divine female
				protector and creator and would find their experience of
				Goddess limited by the assertion that she is not also out
				there as well as within themselves and in all natural
				processes. When asked what the symbol of Goddess
				meant, feminist witch Starhawk replied, &quot;It all depends
				on how 1 feel. When 1 feel weak, She is someone who can
				help and protect me. When I feel strong She is the symbol
				of my own power. At other times 1 feel her as the natural
				energy in my body and the world.&quot;”° How are we to evaluate such a statement? Theologians would call these the
				words of a sloppy thinker. But my deepest intuition tells
				me they contain a wisdom Western theological thought
				has lost.</p>
				<p>To one trained in theology these differing views of the
				&quot;meaning&quot; of the symbol of Goddess sound like an incipient Trinitarian controversy. Is there, I wonder, a way of
				developing a theology that does not lead into dogmatic
				controversy or require us to say definitively that one understanding is true and the others false? Could we possibly
				share our common relation to the symbol and make that
				primary and yet allow our varying interpretations? The
				diverse explications of the symbol “Goddess&quot; suggest that
			</p>
			<p>
				the symbol has a richer significance than any one explication can express. This phenomenological fact suggests the
				need for an abstract theory of symbol in which the symbol
				is viewed as the primary fact and the meanings are viewed
				as secondary. It also suggests that a thea-logy” of the
				Goddess would be very different from the theo-logy we
				know in the West. But to spell out the primacy of symbol
				in thea-logy in contrast to the primacy of explanation in
				theo-logy would be to write another paper. Let me simply
				state that I believe it is incumbent upon woman, who
				have been deprived of a female religious symbol systen
				for so long and who are therefore in an excellent position
				to recognize the power and primacy of symbols, to develop a theory of symbol and thea-logy congruent with their
				experience</p>
				<p>A second important implication of the Goddess symbol
				for women is the affirmation of the female body. Because
				of women’s unique position as menstruants, birth-givers,
				and because they have traditionally cared for the young
				and the dying, women’s connection to the body, nature
				and finitude has been an obvious fact. In early religious
				consciousness birth-giving powers were celebrated and
				women were positively valued. But as Western religions
				entered into a state of alienation from the body, nature
				and this world, women were denigrated because they
				seemed more carnal, fleshy and earthy than the culture
				creating males.12 The misogynist anti-body tradition in
				Western thought is symbolized in the myth of Eve who is
				traditionally viewed as a sexual temptress, the epitome of
				women’s carnal nature. This tradition reaches its nadir in
				the Malleus Maleficarum (The Hammer of Evil-Doing
				Women) which states, “All witchcraft stems from carna
				lust which in women is insatiable.&quot;13</p>
				<p>The denigration of the female body is also expressed in
				the taboos of our culture that surround menstruation and
				childbirth. While menstruation taboos may have originated in a perception of the awesome powers of the female
				body,”4 they have degenerated into a simple perception
				that something is “wrong” with female bodily functions
				Menstruation is viewed as a curse, and women grow up
				believing that the bloody facts of menstruation are best
				hidden. Judy Chicago’s Menstruation Bathroom broke
				these taboos. In a sterile white bathroom she exhibited
				boxes of tampons and Kotex on an open shelf, while the
				wastepaper basket overflowed with bloody tampons and
				Kotex.15 Many women who saw the piece felt relieved to
				have their &quot;dirty secret” out in the open.</p>
				<p>The denigration of the female body and its powers is
				further expressed in Western culture’s attitudes toward
				childbirth. Civing birth is treated as a disease requiring
				hospitalization and the woman is viewed as a passive object, anesthetized to ensure her acquiescence to the will
				of the doctor.16. The women’s liberation movement has
				aided the advocates of natural childbirth and home birth
				by emphasizing the need for women to control and take
				pride in their bodies.</p>
				<p>The symbol of Goddess aids this process of naming and
				reclaiming the female body and its functions. In the ancient world and among modern women, the Goddess symbol represents the birth, death and rebirth processes of the
				natural and human worlds. The female body is viewed as
				a direct expression or incarnation of waxing and waning,
				life and death cycles in the universe because of the connection between the 28-day cycles of menstruation and
			</p>
			<pb n='11'/>
			<p>
				the 28-day cycles of the moon. How amazing it is for
				modern women to learn that many of the ancient Goddess
				figures were painted with red ochre between the legs, the
				menstrual blood out in the open, a symbol of female
				power.&quot;7. The Goddess is often depicted in the act of giving birth, and the birth process is viewed as a symbol of
				the life-giving powers of the universe.18 The possibilities
				of reclaiming the powers of the female body in Goddess
				rituals are expressed in the summer solstice ritual created
				by Barbry MyOwn and Hallie Mountainwing. In this ritual
				the women simulated a birth canal through which they
				birthed each other into their circle. They raised power by
				placing their hands on each other’s bellies and chanting
				together. Finally, they marked each other’s faces with rich
				dark menstrual blood saying, “This is the blood that promises renewal. This is the blood that promises sustenance.
				This is the blood that promises life.&quot;19 From hidden dirty
				secret to symbol of the life power of the Goddess, women’s blood has come full circle. The degree to which this
				ritual seems indelicate or shocking indicates how far
				modern culture is from perceiving the sacrality of the
				female body</p>
				<p>The mood created by the symbol of Goddess as life
				and birth power is one of positive, joyful affirmation of
				the female body and its powers and processes. The motivations are to overcome the stereotypes of menstruant
				women as hysterical, to recognize the blood bonds shared
				by women, to value birth as an expression of the ultimate
				life power, to return the birth process to the hands of
				women and to overcome the spirit/flesh dualism of Western culture.</p>
				<p>While the symbolic reclamation of the body and nature is especially important to women who have been associated with the despised body, it also has profound significance
			</p>

				for men and all beings. The denigration of the
				body and the spirit/flesh, mind/body split has been injurious to men too. The denigration of the body and
				nature has also contributed to our current ecological crisis
				because nature has been viewed simply as material for
				human consumption. Thus, the Goddess as symbol of the
				revaluation of body and nature can pull together many of
				the themes addressed separately in the human potential
				and ecology movements. In this case the mood is one of
				affirmation, awe and respect for the body and nature and
				the motivation is to respect the teaching of the body and
				the rights of all living beings</p>
				<p>A third important implication of the symbol of Goddess for women is the positive valuation of will in a Coddess-centered framework. Here 1 am not referring to the
				symbol of Goddess in general, but specifically to the notion of will in Goddess-centered ritual magic and spell-casting. The basic notion behind ritual magic and spell-casting is energy as power. The Goddess is a center or
				focus of power and energy; She is the personification of
				the energy which flows between beings in the natural and
				human worlds. According to Starhawk, “witches conceive
				of psychic energy as having form and substance that can
				be perceived and directed by those with a trained awareness. The power generated within the circle is built into a
				cone form, and at its peak is released—to the Goddess, to
				reenergize the members of the coven, or to do a specific
				work such as healing.&quot;20 In ritual magic, energy is directed by will power.</p>
				<p>The emphasis on the will is important for women because women traditionally have been taught to devalue
				their wills, to believe that they cannot achieve their will
				through their own power and even to suspect that the assertion of will is evil. Faith Wilding&apos;s poem &quot;Waiting
				sums up women’s sense that their lives are defined not by
				their own will, but by waiting for others to take the initiative.</p>
				<p>Waiting for my breasts to develop
				<lb/>Waiting to wear a bra
				<lb/>Waiting to menstruate
				<lb/>Waiting for life to begin, Waiting..
				<lb/>Waiting to be somebody
				<lb/>Waiting to get married
				<lb/>Waiting for my wedding day
				<lb/>Waiting for my wedding night
				<lb/>Waiting for the end of the day
				<lb/>Waiting for sleep. Waiting... 21</p>
				<p>Patriarchal religion has enforced the view that female
				initiative and will are evil through the juxtaposition of Eve
				and Mary. Eve caused the fall by asserting her will over
				and against the command of God, while Mary began the
				new age with her response to God’s initiative, “Let it be
				done to me according to thy word” (Luke 1:38). Even for
				men, patriarchal religions value the passive will. The
				classical doctrines of sin and grace view sin as the prideful
				assertion of will and grace as the obedient subordiatnion
				of human will (female or male) to the divine initiative or
				order. Although this view of will might be questioned
				from a human perspective, Valerie Saiving Goldstein has
				argued that it has particularly deleterious consequences
				for women in Western culture. According to Goldstein,
				secular Western culture encourages males in the assertion
			</p>
			<pb n='12'/>
			<p>
				of will; thus in practice we may find that the male form of
				sin is an excess of will. But since culture discourages females in the assertion of will, the traditional doctrines of
				sin and grace encourage women to remain in their form of
				sin, which is self-negation or insufficient assertion of
				will.22 One possible reason for the denigration of will in a
				patriarchal religious framework is that both human and
				divine will are often pictured as arbitrary, self-initiatec
				and exercised without regard for other wills.</p>
				<p>In a Goddess-centered context, in contrast, the will is
				valued. A woman is encouraged to know her will, to believe that her will is valid and to believe that her will can
				be achieved in the world—three sources of strength and
				motivation to take direct action, sources traditionally
				denied to her in patriarchy. In a Goddess-centered framework a woman’s will is not subordinated to the Lord God
				as King and Ruler, nor to men as His representatives. Thus
				a woman is not reduced to waiting for and acquiescing to
				the will of others as she is in patriarchy. But neither does
				she adopt the egocentric form of will that pursues self-interest without regard for the interests of others.</p>
				<p>The Goddess-centered context provides a different understanding of will than that available in the traditiona
				patriarchal religious framework. In the Goddess framework, will can be achieved only when it is exercised in
				harmony with the energies and wills of other beings. Wise
				women, for example, raise a cone of healing energy at the
				full moon or solstice when the lunar or solar energies are
				at their high points with respect to the earth. This discipline encourages them to recognize that not all times
				are propitious for the achieving of every will. Similarly
				they know that spring is a time for new beginnings in work
				and love; summer, a time for producing external manifestations of inner potentialities; and fall or winter, times
				for stripping down to the inner core and for extending
				roots. Such awareness of waxing and waning processes in
				the universe discourages the arbitrary ego-centered assertion of will, while at the same time encouraging the assertion of individual will in cooperation with natural
				energies and the energies created by the wills of others.
				Wise women also have a traditional belief that whatever is
				sent out will be returned, and this reminds them to assert
				their wills in cooperative and healing ways rather than in
				egocentric and destructive ones. This view of will allows
				women to begin to recognize, claim and assert their will:
				without adopting the undesirable characteristics of the
				patriarchal understanding and use of will. This is not,
				however, to imply that women invariably exercise their
				wills for good. Women have as much of a capacity for
				positive and negative thoughts and actions as men do. All
				1am saying is that in the Goddess-centered context, the
				will of women is not devalued per se as it is in the Biblical
				and theological traditions discussed above.</p>
				<p>In the Goddess-centered framework the mood is one of
				positive affirmation of personal will in the context of the
				energies of other wills or beings. The motivation is for
				women to know and to assert their wills in cooperation
				with other wills and energies.</p>
				<p>The fourth and final aspect of the symbol of Goddess is
				the significance of the Goddess for a revaluation of
				mother-daughter relations and women’s heritage. According to Virginia Woolf, a sentence such as “Chloe liked
				Olivia,” which describes a woman’s relationship to another woman, rarely occurs in stories written by men because
			</p>
			<p>
				men write
				women only in their relationship to a
				man (or men).23 Adrienne Rich points out that the mother-daughter relationship, perhaps the most important relationship of woman to woman, a relationship &quot;resonant
				with charges. ..the flow of energy between two biologically alike bodies, one of which has lain in amniotic bliss
				inside the other, one of which has labored to give birth to
				the other”24 is rarely celebrated in patriarchal religion anc
				culture. Christianity celebrates the father’s relation to the
				son and the mother’s relation to the son but the story of
				the mother and daughter is missing.</p>
				<p>In patriarchal literature and psychology, the relationship between mothers and daughters is seldom considered
				or even mentioned. As de Beauvoir has noted, the mother
				daughter relationship is distorted in our male-defined
				culture because the mother (perhaps subconsciously) be
				lieves her role is to prepare her daughter to enter into that
				male-controlled culture in which women are viewed as
				inferior.25 The mother socializes her daughter to become
				subordinate to men, and if the daughter challenges patriarchal norms, the mother is likely to defend the patriarchal structures against her own daughter.</p>
				<p>The bond ot woman to woman is beginning to be celebrated in the new women’s culture. Holly Near has written
				several songs that celebrate the woman bond and women’s heritage. In one of her finest songs she writes of an
				&quot;old time woman” who is &quot;waiting to die.” A young woman feels for the life that has passed the old woman by and
				begins to cry, but the old woman looks her in the eye and
				says, &quot;Ifl had not suffered, you wouldn’t be wearing those
				jeans/ Being an old time woman ain’t as bad as it seems.&quot;2e
				This song expresses and celebrates a bond and a heritage
				passed down from one woman to another. In another of
				Near’s songs, she sings of &quot;a hiking boot mother who&apos;s
				seeing the world/ For the first time with her own little
				girl.&quot; In this song, the mother tells the drifter who has
				been traveling with her to pack up and travel alone if he
				thinks &quot;traveling three is a drag” because “l’ve got a little
				one who loves me as much as you need me/ And darling
				that’s loving enough.&quot;2 This song is significant because
				the mother places her relationship to her daughter above
				her relationship to a man, something that is rare for women to do in patriarchy.28</p>
				<p>One of the few accounts of a relationship between
				mother and daughter that has survived from ancient times
				is the myth of the Goddess Demeter and her daughter
				Persephone. This story was told, possibly enacted, in connection with the religious rites of the Thesmophoria
				which were for women only, and the Eleusinian Mysteries
				of Greece. In this story Persephone is abducted by the
				God of the Underworld and forced to live in the Underworld as his wife. Unwilling to accept this state of affairs,
				Mother Demeter, in her rage, withholds the rain and thus
				prevents the growth of all food until her daughter is returned to her. What is important for women in this ancient religious story is that the mother fights for her
				daughter and for her relationship to her daughter. This is a
				completely different view of the mother’s relationship to
				her daughter from that which exists in a patriarchal culture. The mood created by the story of Demeter and Persephone is one of sacred celebration of the mother
				daughter bond and the motivation is for mothers and
				daughters to affirm the heritage passed on from mother to
				daughter and to reject the patriarchal pattern in which
			</p>
			<pb n='13'/>
			<p>
				mother and daughter betray each other for the sake of
				men.
				The symbol of the goddess has much to offer women
				who are struggling to be rid of the “powerful, pervasive,
				and long-lasting moods and motivations” of the devaluation of female power, denigration of the female body, distrust of female will and denial of the mother-daughter
				bond and women’s heritage that have been engendered
				by patriarchal religions. As women struggle to create a
				new culture in which women’s power, bodies, will and
				bonds are celebrated, the symbol of the Goddess naturally
				reemerges and speaks to the deep mind, expressing our
				new vision of the beauty, strength and power of women.</p>

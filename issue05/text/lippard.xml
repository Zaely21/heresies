               <lb/>When he saw that Amaterasu was about to
               <lb/>celebrate the feast of first-fruits, he secretly
               <lb/>voided excrement in the New Palace. Moreover,
               <lb/>when he saw that Amaterasu was in her sacred
               <lb/>weaving hall, engaged in weaving garments of the
               <lb/>gods, he flayed a piebald colt of heaven, and
               <lb/>breaking a hole in the roof-tiles of the hall, flung
               <lb/>it in. Then Amaterasu started with alarm and
               <lb/>wounded herself with the shuttle. Indignant of
               <lb/>this, she straightaway entered the Rock-cave of
               <lb/>heaven and having fastened the Rock-door, dwelt
               <lb/>there in seclusion. Therefore constant darkness
               <lb/>prevailed on all sides and the alternation of night
               <lb/>and day was unknown.
            </p>
            <p>
               <lb/>The result can be seen in the coating of rocks
               <lb/>and pebbles perceptible in one lunar period, inert
               <lb/>in another. In the circles the rows the rings the
               <lb/>kistvaens the cairns the barrows the banks. In the
               <lb/>beds of streams. In a line of ragged stones
               <lb/>climbing the slope to meet a ring of ashes. In
               <lb/>stone blades cutting the throat of the sky on some
               <lb/>days, dulled by the mists on others. In the strain
               <lb/>felt by enormous Earth groaning my children you
               <lb/>have a savage father he was the one who started
               <lb/>using violence. In execution sites and prisons
               <lb/>where the spirals are reversed. But do not doubt
               <lb/>the capacity of a high wind to transport the
               <lb/>hawthorn may willow yew elm apple or hazel
               <lb/>seeds such distances. We cannot after all fathom
               <lb/>the doings of Tiamat. The stone has shared with
               <lb/>its surroundings the conditions of estrangement
               <lb/>saturation punishment sunken lanes twisted trunks
               <lb/>acid soil and sucking bogs directed from the body
               <lb/>below.

               <lb/>At first there was water everywhere. The peat is cut by convicts. Moss. Springy with thorns and yellow
               <lb/>flowers. In caves above caves women have always made sacrifices, and if such a stone is broken an iron stair
               <lb/>will be found extending completely across its red ash, its flinty luster, the irridescent film which forms on
               <lb/>small pools. Being dried, being moved through the monthly bloodshed the red clay carved as the child knows
               <lb/>the mother, all breasts hips, full and round, head inclined forward, lined with stones and mosses, leaning slabs
               <lb/>beneath the mounds. Burned and buried bones. Excavated by a woman by a fox. A woman named Nameless.
               <lb/>A woman named Restlessness after me. Lo! Even the trees on high mountains near the clouds and the sky
               <lb/>father crouch low toward the earth mother for warmth and protection. A root to the mouth of each corpse
               <lb/>Some of the stones have fallen in the bracken. Some of the stones have been lost to local gates and thresholds.
               <lb/>Some of the stones have been blunted in the effort to push up from underworlds. Flat tops are male triangular
               <lb/>ones female. No one knows. Then even nothingness was not nor existence. There was no air then nor the
               <lb/>heavens beyond it. What covered it? Where was it? In whose keeping? Was there then cosmic water in depths
               <lb/>unfathomed?
               <lb/>What an extraordinary
               <lb/>sight. Succulent madness.
               <lb/>The very absence of
               <lb/>building secrets stolen
               <lb/>from women by masons
               <lb/>who hid the triangle in
               <lb/>circular barns crypts stiles
               <lb/>moorstones with holes cut

            <p>
               <lb/>through and survivors. Too
               <lb/>many little things growing.
               <lb/>A poisoned well squanders
               <lb/>thirst. His dead wife pur
               <lb/>sues him but lzanagi,
               <lb/>managing to escape by the
               <lb/>same way he had gone down under the earth, casts a great rock over the aperture. Husband and wife talk
               <lb/>together for the last time, separated from each other by this rock. Izanagi pronounces the sacramental formula
               <lb/>for separation between them and then goes up to heaven while Izanami goes down forever into subterranean
               <lb/>regions to become goddess of the dead. A mob waving yellow flags follows. Two spotted ponies are trampled
               <lb/>before them. The young one ran and ran and ran across a treeless horizon but the camera followed so she
               <lb/>never seemed to move. A grotesque insect rose from her swaddled corpse. The soil is moist, self-contradictory,
               <lb/>gleaming cruelly under a cold sun.
               <lb/>The persistence of the struggle for existence in an attempt to avoid twin catastrophes. The dialectical
               <lb/>reversal. What has all this got to do with feminism, with real life? With wages for housework, with socialism,
               <lb/>with patriarchy imperialism and the torture of women by fascists in uniform, with witches burned and wives
               <lb/>beaten and little girls drowned, with the irrational objective? Those who regard the conquest of nature as a
               <lb/>social goal pretend not to understand the stones. It is but Tiamat, a woman, who opposed thee with weapons
               <lb/>Draw a line from inside to outside and devour everything in between. Thatâs what. Itâs the guts from which the
               <lb/>screams rise, the
               <lb/>roots of the rage.
               <lb/>Draw a warm bath
               <lb/>and dream of scaling
               <lb/>slimy cliffs. Because
               <lb/>the snake is the only
               <lb/>landliving vertebrate
               <lb/>that naturally and
               <lb/>frequently reproduces
               <lb/>the geodetic spiral.
               <lb/>Remember snakes
               <lb/>coming into women
               <lb/>asleep in the Spanish
               <lb/>fields. And earth
               <lb/>quakes. Because
               <lb/>everything in the
               <lb/>belly of the earth is
               <lb/>alive and growing
               <lb/>Stone circles demand
               <lb/>blood to become
               <lb/>precious. Roses and
            </p>
            <pb n='31'/>
            <p>
               <lb/>crosses. That's what. Ripened tin becoming gold. Veins of petrified water threading their way through the
               <lb/>twisting passageways to the swelling cavern. Through the web woven with silence growing anyway changing
               <lb/>geological to biological time under an average rainfall of summer showers on the last day of the month alas.
               <lb/>An earth caught between layers of water waiting for the spirals to reverse. In spite of holy wet divined with
               <lb/>rods, the powers of knapweed, toadflax and angelica, haloes have shadows. Weaving animals mark the
               <lb/>surfaces with paths. Wavy aquastats mark meandering stone lines. Labyrinths become dances. Feeling down.
               <lb/>Looking up. Underground waters overhead stars. Why not a double alignment? Satene drew a spiral with nine
               <lb/>turns on a dancing ground and placed herself at the center of it. From Hainuweleâs arms she made a door and
               <lb/>summoned the men, âSince you have killed I will no longer live here, I shall leave this very day. Now you will
               <lb/>have to come to me through this door.
               <lb/>From the warmth of our skin from the damp of our sex from the thrust of our bone through our flesh over
               <lb/>the blind springs where animals give birth to stone people between the notched peaks and I am living not by
               <lb/>accident at a well over a spring in a valley on a hill within the metamorphic halo around the granite uplands,
               <lb/>your stones are growing. Petra genetrix, Matrix mundi, we will vomit our desires excrete our sacrifices piss
               <lb/>away our bitterness bleed out our triumphs onto your slippery lap. Our stench will spread through the porous
               <lb/>ruin. Our circles will last another three thousand years, reaching from spirals of underground waters to their
               <lb/>reflections in the nebulae. We suffer the diseases of granite and stagnant pools. Our waters cannot escape by
               <lb/>surface flow but must raise mists, press the bloodstreams in layers that answer to sun and moon. Like the
               <lb/>mistletoe our seeds are quickened only when dropped near blind springs where seeing is forgetting and the
               <lb/>blades cling flat to the groundswells in the November gales and crystallize in frosts. Even the swarming fossils
               <lb/>feed our impatience.
               <lb/>You digress. Ãf course. One fragment placed over another. No such thing as coincidence tunneling
               <lb/>unnoticed unexplained through salty dirt. Unexcavated. Living in the present expecting the future and waiting
               <lb/>for the moon to grow fuller and fuller until it bursts into stars in the past. The circles the rows the kistvaens the
               <lb/>cairns the barrows the banks the rotting memories. Scraps of pottery, oaks choked by ivy. Mud. And celestial
               <lb/>events under cloud cover. Question marks are hooks as questions are? Itâs antiquated romantic irrelevant
               <lb/>belongs somewhere else. But I found this place by accident in the green rain?

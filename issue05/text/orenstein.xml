				<lb/>The Reemergence of the Archetype of the Great
				<lb/>Goddess in Art by Contemporary Women
				<lb/>Gloria Feman Orenstein
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb/>As the archetype of the Great God
				<lb/>dess reemerges into consciousness
				<lb/>today, women artists, through trans
				<lb/>personal visionary experiences, are
				<lb/>bringing to light energic psychic
				<lb/>forces, symbols, images, artifacts and
				<lb/>rituals whose configurations con
				<lb/>stitute the basic paradigm of a new
				<lb/>feminist myth for our time.
				<lb/>When a psychological need arises i
				<lb/>seems inevitably the deeper layers of
				<lb/>the collective unconscious are acti
				<lb/>vated and sooner or later the memory of
				<lb/>a myth of an event or an earlier psychic
				<lb/>state emerges into consciousness.
				<lb/>Evoking the memory of an earlien
				<lb/>psychic state, one in which divinity
				<lb/>was seen to reside in matter and the
				<lb/>energies of the earth were revered as
				<lb/>sacred, the Goddess has become that
				<lb/>symbol of transformation which
				<lb/>activates those forces within woman
				<lb/>identified with holiness and with cre
				<lb/>ative power. If the artist is the avatar
				<lb/>of the new age, the alchemist whose
				<lb/>great Art is the transformation of con
				<lb/>sciousness and being, then contem
				<lb/>porary women artists such as Mary
				<lb/>Beth Edelson, Carolee Schneemann,
				<lb/>Mimi Lobell, Buffie Johnson, Judy
				<lb/>Chicago, Donna Byars, Donna Henes,
				<lb/>Miriam Sharon, Ana Mendieta, Betsy
				<lb/>Damon, Betye Saar, Monica Sjoo and
				<lb/>Hannah Kay, by summoning up the
				<lb/>powers associated with the Goddess
				<lb/>archetype, are energizing a new forn
				<lb/>of Goddess consciousness, which, in
				<lb/>its most recent manifestation is ex
				<lb/>orcising the patriarchal creation myth
				<lb/>through a repossession of the female
				<lb/>visionary faculties.
				<lb/>This new Goddess consciousness
				<lb/>might be described most effectively as
				<lb/>a holistic mind-body totality. As we
				<lb/>move away from the cultural dom
				<lb/>inance of the masculine archetype
				<lb/>characterized by a mind-body duality,
				<lb/>we find that the model of the sor
				<lb/>cerer’s vision serves as a corrective
				<lb/>alternative for a consciousness expan
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb/>sion in which intuitive body-knowl-
				<lb/>edge is reaffirmed as a faculty of intel
				<lb/>ligence. Transcending the false du
				<lb/>alities and dichotomies established by
				<lb/>patriarchal systems of thought which
				<lb/>split mind from body, spirit from mat
				<lb/>ter and sacred from profane, the Great
				<lb/>Goddess as a psychic symbol suggests
				<lb/>the rebirth of woman to a holistic
				<lb/>psychophysical perception of the
				<lb/>sacred, as a new form of her feminist
				<lb/>evolution.
				<lb/>Artists who are in touch with the
				<lb/>archetype of the Goddess are now us
				<lb/>ing the female form in both image and
				<lb/>ritual as an instrument of spirit-knowl
				<lb/>edge. They are training the body so
				<lb/>that it functions as a conscious per
				<lb/>ceptor and transformer of the power
				<lb/>ful energies that reside in matter, both
				<lb/>animal and vegetable. Through the
				<lb/>psychophysical participation in Edel
				<lb/>son’s magical ceremonies of evoca
				<lb/>tion, through the transformation of
				<lb/>the body into a living totem in
				<lb/>Damon’s rituals, through the stimula
				<lb/>tion of the body via meditation upon
				<lb/>the power points in the body icons of
				<lb/>Kurz’s self-portrait as the Durga, or
				<lb/>Mailman's mirror image as God,
				<lb/>through the fusion of the body with
				<lb/>the earth itself in Mendieta’s alchem
				<lb/>ical burials, through the sacrilization
				<lb/>of the body in Lobell's Goddess Tem
				<lb/>ple, and through a merging with the
				<lb/>spirit of the Goddess in Suzanne Ben
				<lb/>ton’s masked ritual theater, women
				<lb/>are gradually repossessing the powers
				<lb/>long associated with the various man
				<lb/>ifestations of the archetype of the
				<lb/>Goddess.
				<lb/>This new art (in which the arche
				<lb/>type of the Goddess plays a catalytic
				<lb/>role) is not based upon an original
				<lb/>creation myth connected with the fer
				<lb/>tiity and birth mysteries. In its modern
				<lb/>transformed meaning, it is about the
				<lb/>mysteries of woman’s rebirth from
				<lb/>the womb of historical darkness, in
				<lb/>which her powers were so long en
				<lb/>shrouded, into a new era where a cul-
				<lb/>ture of her own making will come
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb/>about as a result of a new Earth
				<lb/>Alchemy.
				<lb/>If the alchemy performed by the
				<lb/>male magician sought essentially to
				<lb/>purify brute matter by transforming it
				<lb/>into spirit, taking gold or the philos
				<lb/>opher’s stone as the symbol of spir
				<lb/>itual enlightenment, the supreme goal
				<lb/>of alchemy for women artists today is
				<lb/>to restore the spirit already inherent in
				<lb/>the natural world; to consider matter
				<lb/>itself as a storehouse of the potent
				<lb/>energies most available for transfor
				<lb/>mations in their natural organic state
				<lb/>Women are attempting nothing less
				<lb/>than the magical dealchemizing of
				<lb/>the philosopher’s stone, the recon
				<lb/>stitution of the Earth Goddess’s origi
				<lb/>nal herborium on the planet and the
				<lb/>energizing of the self through the
				<lb/>internalization of its sacred spirits. It
				<lb/>is no mere coincidence that the al
				<lb/>chemical symbols of “witchcraft,” the
				<lb/>magic of the wise women who wor-
				<lb/>shipped the Goddess, are herbs,
				<lb/>grains, plants and seeds. The desire to
				<lb/>alter both mental and physical func
				<lb/>tioning translates an impulse to in
				<lb/>tegrate the Earth Goddess’s chemica
				<lb/>secrets into the body and to carry the
				<lb/>Goddess within the self. In so doing,
				<lb/>women now activate a Goddess con
				<lb/>sciousness within matter by means of
				<lb/>which all contemporary culture will
				<lb/>be awakened
				<lb/>Jung said: "To carry a god around in
				<lb/>yourself is a guarantee of happiness
				<lb/>of power, and even of omnipotence in
				<lb/>so far as these are attributes of divin
				<lb/>ity."2
				<lb/>Contemporary woman's need to
				<lb/>carry a "god" around within the self
				<lb/>her desire to transform herself into the
				<lb/>image of the Goddess, arises from a
				<lb/>deep historical imperative. Research
				<lb/>into the history of Goddess worship
				<lb/>gives ample evidence of the desecra
				<lb/>tion of Goddess temples, shrines,
				<lb/>altars and sanctuaries, and of the sys
				<lb/>tematic erasure of all traces of God
				<lb/>dess worship from the face of the
				<lb/>earth. Through the persecution of
			</p>
			<pb n='75'/>
			<p>
				<lb/>witches, sacred knowledge of the Old
				<lb/>Religion had to be transmitted through
				<lb/>visual and oral lore from generation to
				<lb/>generation. Where once the Goddess
				<lb/>was worshipped at sacred natural sites
				<lb/>with the Earth identified as the body
				<lb/>of the Great Mother, today women
				<lb/>are transforming their own bodies into
				<lb/>those sacred repositories of Goddess
				<lb/>knowledge and energy
				<lb/>The repossession by woman of the
				<lb/>attributes of the Great Goddess is
				<lb/>necessary in order to provide fun
				<lb/>damental changes in vision and re
				<lb/>ality. Under the hegemony of patri
				<lb/>archal religions, notably Christianity,
				<lb/>which has conditioned Western con
				<lb/>sciousness over many centuries
				<lb/>through image-making and ritual, a
				<lb/>profound mystification has been per
				<lb/>petrated on so large a scale that one
				<lb/>of the first functions of this new art is
				<lb/>to exorcise the sexist impact and in
				<lb/>terpretation of all sacred imagery.
				<lb/>Christian art, for example, by estab
				<lb/>lishing the paradoxical image of the
				<lb/>Virgin Mother, has encouraged wom
				<lb/>en to hallucinate an impossibility as if
				<lb/>it were a natural image of reality. In
				<lb/>order to reestablish the validity of the
				<lb/>natural image of Mother and Child as
				<lb/>incorporated in the archetype of the
				<lb/>Fertility Goddess, contemporary
				<lb/>artists are celebrating sexuality by in
				<lb/>voking ancient images of the Great
				<lb/>Mother that exalt procreation and
				<lb/>superimposing them over the former
				<lb/>image of the Virgin and Child.
				<lb/>Another integral part of the process
				<lb/>of Goddess-culture art are the expedi
				<lb/>tions to caves, mounds, sanctuaries
				<lb/>shrines or megalithic sites in search of
				<lb/>the energy evoked and the artifacts or
				<lb/>symbols of veneration left by ancient
				<lb/>cults which worshipped the Goddess.
				<lb/>In this kind of search artists are mak
				<lb/>ing the heretofore invisible, manifest
				<lb/>again. This visionary technique of
				<lb/>rendering the invisible and the real
				<lb/>visible once more and ultimately
				<lb/>abolishing the separation between the
				<lb/>spiritual and the material plane rees
				<lb/>tablishes the human and the natural
				<lb/>as the legitimate realm of the divine.
				<lb/>The energy formerly required to ac
				<lb/>cept Christian illusion is now released
				<lb/>for the accomplishment of the true
				<lb/>work of alchemical transformation
				<lb/>that of preparing and retraining the
				<lb/>mind-body perceptor so that womer
				<lb/>may now perform their highest
				<lb/>functions.
				<lb/>This exaltation of natural energies
				<lb/>releases enormous potential so that
				<lb/>women may begin to transform them
				<lb/>selves into living repositories of
				<lb/>sacred knowledge, storing their total
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb/>history within their bodies, their
				<lb/>psychic memory and their art as a
				<lb/>natural form of protection against
				<lb/>future persecution or annihilation. As
				<lb/>bearers of sacred tradition, contem
				<lb/>porary feminist artists use ritual to re
				<lb/>sacrilize the female body, creating a
				<lb/>new sacred space for the enactment
				<lb/>of those magical rebirth ceremónies
				<lb/>that are first coming into our culture
				<lb/>through art.
				<lb/>In Beyond Cod the Father, Mary
				<lb/>Daly, redefining God as a verb, as a
				<lb/>participation in being, rather than
				<lb/>anthropomorphically as a being, sug
				<lb/>gests that women’s participation in
				<lb/>history, her new sisterhood, is a
				<lb/>means of saying "us vs. nonbeing.
				<lb/>What we are about is the human be
				<lb/>coming of that half of the human race
				<lb/>that has been excluded from humanity
				<lb/>by sexual definition.. What is at stake
				<lb/>is a real leap in human evolution, in
				<lb/>itiated by women.
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb/>The Goddess, then, is that arche
				<lb/>type which mediates between image,
				<lb/>energy and history, evolving and un
				<lb/>folding destiny through the redirec
				<lb/>tion of energy into a revolutionary
				<lb/>manifestation of being. When imaged
				<lb/>and celebrated in contemporary art,
				<lb/>the Goddess signifies Being as a verb,
				<lb/>as a creative energy, as a transfor
				<lb/>mative energy, as sacred earth-energy
				<lb/>and as psychic energy. Contemporary
				<lb/>women artists are using the documen
				<lb/>tation that is being gathered on the
				<lb/>various manifestations of the Goddess
				<lb/>from the Upper Paleolithic and Neo
				<lb/>lithic communities to the present both
				<lb/>as visual and as informational data, as
				<lb/>elements of the new art works or
				<lb/>events they are creating in accordance
				<lb/>with the elaboration of a new myth
				<lb/>synonymous with the exigencies of
				<lb/>female culture in the 1970s
				<lb/>Architect Mimi Lobell and two
				<lb/>other women, one a Jungian, have de
			</p>
			<pb n='76'/>
			<p>
				<lb/>signed a Goddess Temple which ex
				<lb/>presses the theme of initiation and
				<lb/>rebirth into a Goddess-centered cul
				<lb/>ture. They consider the temple to be
				<lb/>the externalization of an archetypal
				<lb/>structure that exists within the psy
				<lb/>che. The temple, whose eventual site
				<lb/>will be a mountainous region near
				<lb/>Aspen, Colorado, is conceived as an
				<lb/>alogous to the body of the Goddess
				<lb/>through which the initiate will pass in
				<lb/>a ceremony of transformation. Its
				<lb/>form and materials function as a
				<lb/>catalyst for this process. According to
				<lb/>Lobell, "To go through the temple will
				<lb/>be to experience an initiation into the
				<lb/>mysteries of the feminine and activate
				<lb/>a prelogical consciousness."“
				<lb/>As planned, the temple is ap
				<lb/>proached via an uphill walk along a
				<lb/>"sacred way" lined with figures of
				<lb/>animals. The entrance is at the lower
				<lb/>level, which appears to be buried in
				<lb/>rock. Deep in this rock the veiled
				<lb/>entry leads to a nine-ring labyrinth.
				<lb/>Reversing the process of birth one
				<lb/>enters through the vaginal orifice and
				<lb/>journeys toward the third eye of en
				<lb/>lightenment. The walls of the labyrinth
				<lb/>are covered with exotic fabrics and
				<lb/>tapestries, weavings, batiks, silks and
				<lb/>lace from various ethnic sources. In
				<lb/>the center of the labyrinth lies the
				<lb/>sunken grail pool, inscribed with a
				<lb/>serpentine spiral. A helical ladder, 15
				<lb/>feet high, rises out of the pool and
				<lb/>ascends to the upper temple, which at
				<lb/>eye level becomes a 360-degree open
				<lb/>windowed panorama of the moun
				<lb/>tains and valleys. Over the windows
				<lb/>are 29 perforations in the shape of the
				<lb/>moon, one for each of its monthly day
				<lb/>cycle. The altar is a part of the Great
				<lb/>Eye of Vision of the Eye Goddess.
				<lb/>We are one with that all receptive 360
				<lb/>degree panoramic perception in the
				<lb/>Oculus of the Eye Goddess, warmed by
				<lb/>the fires of Vesta, the libidinous energy
				<lb/>that keeps us integrated with our bodies
				<lb/>and with all of our sensuous lenses onto
				<lb/>the mysteries of the universe. The water
				<lb/>of the hydolunar force has been trans
				<lb/>muted into the fire that ignites the fem
				<lb/>inine wisdom of Sophia and the Muses
				<lb/>and the Oracles and Sybils.
				<lb/>Becoming conscious of the pres
				<lb/>ence of Goddess imagery in one's
				<lb/>work is a long arduous process of
				<lb/>visual reeducation. Carolee Schnee
				<lb/>mann, who in childhood saw the
				<lb/>radiant face of the Great Mother in
				<lb/>the moon and believed that the world
				<lb/>was permeated by invisible energies
				<lb/>unconsciously made her first Goddess
				<lb/>image in 1963 when she was working
				<lb/>on her theater piece Chromolodeon.
				<lb/>In her desire for a companion figure
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb/>for the piece, she made the head of a
				<lb/>horned bull and mounted it on a
				<lb/>clothed dressmaker’s dummy. Seven
				<lb/>years later she was to discover that the
				<lb/>bull was the sacred beast of the Great
				<lb/>Goddess. In the 1960s Schneemann
				<lb/>did not yet understand the real signif
				<lb/>icance of the bull iconography in her
				<lb/>work. In her series of body pieces
				<lb/>such as Meat Joy of 1964, she began
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb/>to put the materials from the static
				<lb/>works onto herself, and in Eye Body
				<lb/>(1963) she used two snakes on her
				<lb/>body in a set of transformative ac
				<lb/>tions. Later, reviewing her artistic
				<lb/>evolution through the 1970’s, Schnee
				<lb/>mann came to understand that the
				<lb/>serpents in her earlier works were re
				<lb/>lated to the Minoan Snake Goddess
				<lb/>through a series of iconographica
				<lb/>similarities and personal connections
				<lb/>The figure of the Minoan Snake
				<lb/>Goddess, arms upright, is currently
				<lb/>featured in much Goddess-culture art
				<lb/>This merging of the self with that of
				<lb/>the Goddess functions as a mirror
				<lb/>reflection in which women see them
				<lb/>selves as the Goddess and the God
				<lb/>dess in themselves.
				<lb/>The process of the evolution of
				<lb/>Goddess consciousness itself became
				<lb/>the theme of Homerunmuse (per
				<lb/>formed at the Brooklyn Museum dur
				<lb/>ing the Women Artists 1550-1950
				<lb/>show, Fall 1977). In a meditation
				<lb/>upon the female and the muse, whose
				<lb/>presence is indicated in the word
				<lb/>"museum," but whose usual absence
				<lb/>from the institution was made ob
				<lb/>vious by the fact of the women artists'
			</p>
			<pb n='77'/>
			<p>
				<lb/>show, Schneemann rejects “the ab
				<lb/>stracted token Muse as fragmenta
				<lb/>tion. Through a collage of texts
				<lb/>Schneemann reiterates the theme of
				<lb/>woman remaking herself into the
				<lb/>image of the Goddess.
				<lb/>Israeli artist Miriam Sharon per
				<lb/>forms desert rituals that are rites of
				<lb/>exorcism overthrowing the patriarchal
				<lb/>model that constructed alienating
				<lb/>cityscapes of concrete over the an
				<lb/>cient earth shrines and sacred sites.
				<lb/>Her pilgrimage to the desert put her in
				<lb/>contact with the Bedouins, “the last
				<lb/>survivors of the Earth Living Culture."
				<lb/>Her own Space Project-Earth People
				<lb/>which grew out of her stay in the
				<lb/>desert is a ritual act of identification
				<lb/>with the Earth Culture. Through med
				<lb/>itation rituals in the wilderness,
				<lb/>Sharon expresses the wish to recreate
				<lb/>an ancient lost myth of the Earth.
				<lb/>Sharon’s reclamation of the barren
				<lb/>earth as the natural holy shrine and
				<lb/>her use of the desert as a temple for
				<lb/>meditation exemplify the return to
				<lb/>primal matter as holy matter. Her par
				<lb/>ticipation with the Bedouins in the life
				<lb/>of the desert as Goddess-space paral
				<lb/>lels the initiatory experience of
				<lb/>Lobell’s Goddess Temple. However,
				<lb/>Sharon defines “holy” as without
				<lb/>shrines or temples, holy in its being
				<lb/>only.
				<lb/>The Bedouins (whom I adopted some
				<lb/>years ago as part of my work) are part
				<lb/>of this “meditative” existence of the
				<lb/>desert. They meditate daily in front of
				<lb/>the wide seas or wide wilderness of the
				<lb/>desert. They kiss the earth for their
				<lb/>existence. They never thanked their
				<lb/>"god" by building huge temples, but
				<lb/>just kissed the sands. When they will
				<lb/>disappear they will never leave behind
				<lb/>any traces for their existence, except
				<lb/>the stones of their burial places. I try
				<lb/>through my art, not to build static
				<lb/>sculptures or monuments in the spaces
				<lb/>but only put human energy through my
				<lb/>art (a ritual art) into something that is
				<lb/>disappearing.
				<lb/>Sharon’s recent Sand Tent Project
				<lb/>involved the participation of a Bed
				<lb/>ouin tribe and a Kibbutz settlement
				<lb/>(Kerem Shalom). The Bedouin Mother
				<lb/>who taught her how to create such a
				<lb/>tent is the last survivor of the tent life
				<lb/>in that area. Sharon’s apprenticeship
				<lb/>to the wise women who know the
				<lb/>secrets of the earth is an affirmation
				<lb/>of woman as Goddess-incarnation.
				<lb/>The desert, for Sharon, symbolizes
				<lb/>patriarchal spiritual values (the barren
				<lb/>emptiness) which must be exorcised
				<lb/>and is, at the same time, that pure
				<lb/>clear space of the new frontier, repre
				<lb/>senting the new female space of
				<lb/>herstory upon which our lost traces
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb/>will be reinscribed and our new destiny
				<lb/>will be written.
				<lb/>Ana Mendieta, who came to the
				<lb/>U.S. from Cuba in 1961, thinks of the
				<lb/>Earth as the Goddess. She recalls a
				<lb/>mountain in Cuba, La Mazapan de
				<lb/>Matanza, that is in the shape of a re
				<lb/>clining woman. Her transformational
				<lb/>rituals explore the boundaries be
				<lb/>tween spirit and matter. In a piece
				<lb/>she did in a labyrinth, Silueta de
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb/>Laberinto (1974), she worked with the
				<lb/>metamorphosis of the self that occurs
				<lb/>in sorcery and trance. In this piece
				<lb/>someone traced her silhouette on the
				<lb/>ground. When Mendieta left the laby
				<lb/>rinth, her image was imprinted upon
				<lb/>the earth, suggesting that through a
				<lb/>merging with the Goddess spirits are
				<lb/>evoked that infuse the body and cause
				<lb/>such occurrences as out-of-body
				<lb/>journeys or astral travel. In Earth

				<lb/>Sorcery, of which all her works are
				<lb/>examples, the Earth Goddess is the
				<lb/>shaman and the spell is invoked
				<lb/>through a magical rite in which
				<lb/>unification with the Earth Mother
				<lb/>transpires. Mendieta is concerned
				<lb/>with rebirth and her grave and buria
				<lb/>mound pieces suggest that material
				<lb/>death does not imply spiritual death
				<lb/>In some of her works, Mendieta
				<lb/>wraps herself in black cloth, imposing
				<lb/>her mummified form upon the ground
				<lb/>which is then dug out around her. A
				<lb/>series of these imprints are eventually
				<lb/>lit with gun powder, leaving silhou
				<lb/>etted after-images embedded in the
				<lb/>earth as a testimony to the magical
				<lb/>site of transformation, the dwelling of
				<lb/>the Goddess, where the human and
				<lb/>the divine had come to mingle as
				<lb/>preparation for a new destiny. Her art
				<lb/>concretizes that process of Earth
				<lb/>Alchemy, using prime matter itself as
				<lb/>the alchemistic vessel through which
				<lb/>spirit will be made to reenter matter
				<lb/>and transform woman into the vital
				<lb/>incarnation of the Earth Goddess once

				<lb/>Buffie Johnson’s paintings celebrate
				<lb/>the natural symbols of the universe
				<lb/>which were recognized as sacred in
				<lb/>the worship of the Great Goddess. The
				<lb/>plant and animal manifestations of
				<lb/>the Goddess are energizers of trans
				<lb/>formation which function like the star
				<lb/>and cross in the Judeo-Christian tradi
				<lb/>tion. They are reminders of the nu
				<lb/>minous state in which all of nature
				<lb/>was held to be sacred. Erich Neumann
				<lb/>writes:
				<lb/>Because originally human life was so
				<lb/>strongly affected by its participation
				<lb/>mystique with the outside world that
				<lb/>stone, plant, and man [sic.], animal
				<lb/>and star were bound together in asingle
				<lb/>stream, one could always transtorm
				<lb/>itself into another.
				<lb/>These symbols reinforce in us an
				<lb/>awareness that we are all manifesta
				<lb/>tions of the one "single stream, the
				<lb/>spirit of the Mother Goddess.
				<lb/>The general "theme" of Johnson's
				<lb/>work since the late 1940s is drawn
				<lb/>from the Jungian concept of the col
				<lb/>lective unconscious and from her
				<lb/>scholarly research on the Great God
				<lb/>dess. The paintings which evolved
				<lb/>with specific reference to the Goddess
				<lb/>show her aspects as Mistress of the
				<lb/>Beasts and Lady of the Plants. Around
				<lb/>the latter, she has created single
				<lb/>image plants in varying aspects of
				<lb/>cyclical transformation, which stim
				<lb/>ulate the unconscious and evoke
				<lb/>mythic memories. The paintings serve
				<lb/>as sacred icons to resurrect the layers
				<lb/>of consciousness in which our most
			</p>
			<pb n='79'/>
			<p>
				<lb/>primordial images, those of the Great
				<lb/>Goddess and of our true origin, lie
				<lb/>buried. In Ariadne ("Barley Mother,
				<lb/>1971), the Goddess of Vegetation is
				<lb/>evoked by the image of the long-grain
				<lb/>barley flowing gently down in a skirt
				<lb/>of rain. A pomegranate bursting from
				<lb/>within (Pomegranate, 1972) recalls
				<lb/>the myth of Persephone and Demeter
				<lb/>and their connection with the life
				<lb/>giving powers of the Feminine. The
				<lb/>monolithic opium seed-pod Lapis
				<lb/>(1970) is a cosmic starglobe exploding
				<lb/>with life, a metaphor for the Goddess
				<lb/>from whose womb all is born. In
				<lb/>Pasiphae (1976) the image of the iris,
				<lb/>the sacred lily of Crete, merges with
				<lb/>that of a bovine head, so that both
				<lb/>animal and plant symbols of the God
				<lb/>dess coalesce in a new charged sign.
				<lb/>References to the myth of the Min
				<lb/>otaur and the labyrinth are suggested;
				<lb/>the labyrinth of the Goddess being the
				<lb/>place where one loses and finds one
				<lb/>self again—the unconscious. The col
				<lb/>lective symbols are here employed as
				<lb/>forces of awakening, the artist reach
				<lb/>ing deep into the buried past when the
				<lb/>Goddess and all of nature were re
				<lb/>vealed as One.
				<lb/>Donna Byar’s work shows the cre-
				<lb/>ative processes at work in the de
				<lb/>ciphering of the oracle of the Goddess
				<lb/>as She speaks to the artist through the
				<lb/>labyrinth of dream and visionary ex
				<lb/>perience. Oracle Stone Crove, for ex
				<lb/>ample, evolved from a dream.
				<lb/>A stone woman who sat in a grove of
				<lb/>trees spoke to me in vapors, not words.
				<lb/>She was very poetic and mystical and
				<lb/>spoke only in truths. All of a sudden, like
				<lb/>in a faint, she slid from her chair into a
				<lb/>hole in the underground. I grabbed her
				<lb/>before she went underground and when
				<lb/>she came up she was no longer able to
				<lb/>speak. I woke up with a terrible feeling
				<lb/>of sadness.
				<lb/>In the piece itself, “All the com
				<lb/>ponents. .. sit on the floor and do not
				<lb/>occupy any wall space, two stones are
				<lb/>arranged perpendicular to each othe
				<lb/>sitting on an old paint scratched
				<lb/>rocker in a grove of four weeping fig
				<lb/>trees. For Byars, the Grove becomes a
				<lb/>shrine.
				<lb/>In works such as Vested Relic where
				<lb/>stone and silver wings are enclosed
				<lb/>within a blindfolded cage, creating a
				<lb/>secret altar and a reliquary, Byars pre
				<lb/>serves the magical objects that reveal
				<lb/>to her the presence of the Goddess as
				<lb/>a guardian spirit in her world. The
				<lb/>blindfolding of the cage symbolizes
				<lb/>that these sacred objects can only be
				<lb/>perceived with the inner eye. Byar's
				<lb/>glass collages make visible the appari
				<lb/>tions of the Mother Goddess in images
			</p>
			<pb n='80'/>
			<p>
				<lb/>of a winged being and a shaman, who
				<lb/>appears to us during altered states of
				<lb/>consciousness.
				<lb/>For Byars, the world is vibrant and
				<lb/>alive with signs and guideposts. Many
				<lb/>of her pieces are themselves omens
				<lb/>assembled from objects and materials
				<lb/>which spoke to her in oracular modes
				<lb/>One such object is Swathe, which
				<lb/>combines feathers and a wing on a
				<lb/>swathed ironing board that has lilies
				<lb/>of the valley wrapped in chamois
				<lb/>placed upon it. These totems and
				<lb/>talismans conjure up archaic imagery
				<lb/>from the distant past. Animal horns,
				<lb/>wings, feathers, shells, trees, serpents,
				<lb/>brought together in these mytho
				<lb/>poetic assemblages, activate intimate
				<lb/>relationships between natural mate
				<lb/>rials, objects and living things that il
				<lb/>luminate essences which were former
				<lb/>ly only visible to seers and shamans.
				<lb/>The presence of the Goddess is thus
				<lb/>revealed and brought into contem
				<lb/>porary consciousness.
				<lb/>Mary Beth Edelson’s work has long
				<lb/>been intimately involved in the ex
				<lb/>plorations of the Goddess. In 1961 her
				<lb/>painting of Madonna and Child en
				<lb/>titled Codhead introduced concentric
				<lb/>circles as sources of energy from the
				<lb/>Madonna’s head. In these early paint
				<lb/>ings? her women were frequently de
				<lb/>picted with their arms uplifted, rem
				<lb/>iniscent of the posture of many early
				<lb/>Goddess figures. The primal image of
				<lb/>the outstretched arms of the ancient
				<lb/>Goddess, whose power must be re
				<lb/>claimed by women for themselves to
				<lb/>day, is seen by Edelson not only as a
				<lb/>spiritual signifier, but as a contem
				<lb/>porary symbol of our political ac
				<lb/>tivism.
				<lb/>In 1969 she began to evolve a more
				<lb/>defined and specific area of arche
				<lb/>typal imagery, out of which emerged
				<lb/>the exhibition Woman Rising, revolu
				<lb/>tionary in the way it brought to con
				<lb/>sciousness psychic material about the
				<lb/>Great Goddess. Her most innovative
				<lb/>images for today have been the body
				<lb/>images she has created through per
				<lb/>forming private body rituals where the
				<lb/>body itself is the house of wisdom. In
				<lb/>these, the artist calls upon Goddess
				<lb/>energy, using her own body as a
				<lb/>stand-in for the Goddess and as a
				<lb/>symbol for Everywoman, whose ex
				<lb/>panded states of body-consciousness
				<lb/>and multiple transformations are
				<lb/>evoked through contact with powerful
				<lb/>natural energies.
				<lb/>1977, Edelson per
				<lb/>On March 1,
				<lb/>formed a mourning ritual ceremony
				<lb/>for her exhibition, Your 5,000 Years
				<lb/>Are Up, entitled Mourning Our Lost
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb/>Herstory, at the Mandeville Gallery,
				<lb/>University of California at La Jolla.
				<lb/>Ten women sat in a circle in the cen
				<lb/>ter of a fire ring, the only source of
				<lb/>light, chanting and wailing while
				<lb/>seven silent eight-foot high black
				<lb/>draped figures, which had previously
				<lb/>seemed to be an uninhabitated formal
				<lb/>sculptural installation on the back
				<lb/>wall, came alive and began to move
				<lb/>around the cavernous gallery. More
				<lb/>recently, she performed a mourning
				<lb/>reclamation ritual at A.I.R. Gallery,
				<lb/>New York City, entitled Proposals For.
				<lb/>Memorials to the 9,000,000 Women
				<lb/>Burned as Witches in the Christian
				<lb/>Era. This ritual, based on research
				<lb/>about witch burning in relation to
				<lb/>women who were Goddess worship
				<lb/>pers evoked the spirits of individual
				<lb/>women who were tortured during the
				<lb/>Inquisition. Edelson is not content,
				<lb/>however, to exorcise the past; her art
				<lb/>is about mythic recreation of holy
				<lb/>spaces for women’s culture today.
				<lb/>Donna Henes’s Spider Woman, a
				<lb/>series of process environmental sculp
				<lb/>tures, makes reference to the Mother
				<lb/>Goddess of the Navaho Emergence
				<lb/>Myth about whom Sheila Moon has
				<lb/>written, "She is the protective fem
				<lb/>inine objectivity. Spider Woman is the
				<lb/>unobtrusive but powerful archetype
				<lb/>of fate—not in the sense of deter
				<lb/>minism, but in the sense of the
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb/>magical law of one's own ’gravity
				<lb/>which leads always beyond itself
				<lb/>towards wholeness.””0 In a state of
				<lb/>trance and meditation, Henes spins
				<lb/>her web of various kinds of fibers in
				<lb/>natural settings and in public places
				<lb/>where they can be altered by the
				<lb/>specific environmental conditions of

				<lb/>the web as a map of the subconscious
				<lb/>and as a form of primal meditation.
				<lb/>Henes performs a yearly winter sol
				<lb/>stice celebration Reverence to Her: A
				<lb/>Chant to Invoke the Female Forces of
				<lb/>the Universe Present in All People.
				<lb/>The winter solstice is the time when
				<lb/>"the Great Mother gives birth to the
				<lb/>sun, who is Her son, and stands at the
				<lb/>center of the matriarchal mysteries.
				<lb/>At the winter solstice, the moon oc
				<lb/>cupies the highest point in its cycle,
				<lb/>the sun is at its nadir, and the constel
				<lb/>lation Virgo rises in the east."12
				<lb/>Henes’s participatory chant invokes
				<lb/>the Great Goddess, the archetypal
				<lb/>female principle of communal crea
				<lb/>tion and continuity, and gives rev
				<lb/>erence to the female power “who ex
				<lb/>ists in all beings in the form of con
				<lb/>sciousness, reason, sleep, hunger,

				<lb/>If the webs are a materialization of
				<lb/>a female spirit-presence in the en

				<lb/>ture within matter itself, her work
				<lb/>makes us visualize this presence,
				<lb/>evokes it, and brings it forth out of the
				<lb/>void, making manifest the intercon
				<lb/>nectedness of all space and time
				<lb/>through the weaving of the great web
				<lb/>of life, which is the work of the Mother

				<lb/>Betye Saar’s work, through its mys
				<lb/>tical, visionary imagery, probes the

				<lb/>and the Queen of the Witches, col
				<lb/>lecting the amulets and artifacts of
				<lb/>these cultures and placing them in her
				<lb/>boxes in order to create potent talis

				<lb/>1977, Betsy Damon covered herself

				<lb/>the artist and her assistant, through

				<lb/>seeks to transform the body and the

				<lb/>Damon has been performing rituals

				<lb/>each woman gives birth to another
				<lb/>chanting, "I am a woman. I can give
				<lb/>birth to you." In the Naming Ritual
				<lb/>performed in Ithaca, women chanted,
				<lb/>"I am a woman. I give you my hand
				<lb/>We are women. Our circle is power

				<lb/>that parallels the advent of female

				<lb/>then the whole universe. A woman's
				<lb/>body is, in itself, the whole universe:
				<lb/>birth, life, death, and communica

				<lb/>Judy Chicago has made a major
				<lb/>contribution to this tradition by con
				<lb/>ceptualizing and creating a traveling
				<lb/>multi-media exhibition, The Dinner
				<lb/>Party Project, an environmental re
				<lb/>casting of the history of Western
				<lb/>civilization in feminist terms.15. Ac
				<lb/>companying the Dinner Party Proj-
				<lb/>ect's exhibition, is a book in the form
				<lb/>of an illuminated manuscript of five
				<lb/>sections, some of which include a re
				<lb/>writing of Genesis as an alternate
				<lb/>creation myth in which the Goddess is
				<lb/>the supreme Creatrix. It also contains
				<lb/>a section of myths, legends and tales
				<lb/>of the women, a vision of the Apoc
				<lb/>alypse which is a vision of the world
				<lb/>made whole by the infusion of fem
				<lb/>inist values, and the Calling of the
				<lb/>Disciplines, a list of the women rep
				<lb/>resented in the table relating who they
				<lb/>were and what they did.
				<lb/>Chicago’s work has long been mak
				<lb/>ing links between female iconography
				<lb/>and a feminist reinterpretation of the
				<lb/>Creation Myth. In her series of por
				<lb/>celain plates entitled The Butterfly
				<lb/>Coddesses: Other Specimens (1974)
				<lb/>which includes The Butterfly Vagina
				<lb/>as the Venus of Willendorf, The But
				<lb/>terfly Vagina as the Creat Round, etc.
				<lb/>sexuality is expressly connected to
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb/>spiritual transformation. For Chicago
				<lb/>the butterfly symbolizes both liberty
				<lb/>and metamorphosis. The new speci
				<lb/>mens in The Butterfly Coddess series
				<lb/>represent a new breed of women:
				<lb/>these are women yet to be born to a
				<lb/>world in which the Goddess is recog
				<lb/>nized as the original deity; women
				<lb/>whose sexual energy is accepted as a
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb/>legitimate form of creative power
				<lb/>Her Womantree series suggests the
				<lb/>principle of a female Tree of Life out
				<lb/>of which these "Ancient New Beings'
				<lb/>will emerge, possessing all the secrets
				<lb/>of the matriarchal past transmitted
				<lb/>over time through the sacred matri
				<lb/>lineage women now reclaim. Chica-
				<lb/>go’s flower forms, seed shapes and
				<lb/>pod forms relate to the principles of
				<lb/>feminist alchemy and suggest the final
				<lb/>transmutation into “The Ancient New
				<lb/>Being" of which the butterfly is her
				<lb/>prime symbol.
				<lb/>Chicago’s dream has always been to
				<lb/>bring art out of the world and back
				<lb/>into the culture so that it will effect
				<lb/>the people as it once did in the Middle

				<lb/>Monica Sjoo’s synthesizing of ar

				<lb/>of AIl, which will be published by

				<lb/>a poetic attempt to cull all informa

				<lb/>feminist occult reading of history,
				<lb/>symbolism, myth, art and literature,
				<lb/>and bring it into a powerful reevalua
				<lb/>tion of many of the philosophical
				<lb/>underpinnings of contemporary
				<lb/>thought. Her art works create Goddess
				<lb/>emblems which narrate the story of
				<lb/>the real crucifixion, that of women
				<lb/>who have been sacrificed upon the
			</p>
			<pb n='84'/>
			<p>
				<lb/>cross of patriarchal culture. They
				<lb/>speak of female rebirth into a new
				<lb/>ethos through the revolutionary force
				<lb/>of women as workers and visionaries.
				<lb/>Contemporary Goddess-culture art
				<lb/>with its many varied manifestations,
				<lb/>is creating a whole new constellation
				<lb/>of charged signs, aspirational images
				<lb/>icons for contemplation, talismanic
				<lb/>artifacts, and symbolic rites of pas
				<lb/>sage that constitute the source of a
				<lb/>new reality for women
				<lb/>Artists of the Surrealist tradition like
				<lb/>Leonora Carrington, Leonor Fini
				<lb/>Meret Oppenheim, Frida Kahlo anc
				<lb/>Remedios Varo, artists participating ir
				<lb/>the Sister Chapel exhibition (Woman
				<lb/>art, Winter 1977) such as Diana Kurz
				<lb/>and Cynthia Mailman, Canadiar
				<lb/>artists Jovette Marchessault (totemic
				<lb/>sculptural figures) and Suzanne Guité
				<lb/>(stone sculpture), Thérèse Guité
				<lb/>(batik) and other contemporary Amer
				<lb/>ican artists such as Faith Wilding,
				<lb/>Suzanne Benton (welded sculpture
				<lb/>and mask ritual theater), Julia Barklen
				<lb/>etc. are creating a new feminist myth
				<lb/>in which woman becomes the vital
				<lb/>connecting link between all forms of
				<lb/>life in the cosmos; the great catalyser
				<lb/>and transformer of life energies. By
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb/>the repossession of Goddess power
				<lb/>and by a full participation in Her Be
				<lb/>ing, women are bringing into ex
				<lb/>istence a vastly expanded state of
				<lb/>ecstatic consciousness.
				<lb/>Through the many ceremonies of
				<lb/>rebirth and reclamation, the rituals of
				<lb/>mourning and self-transformation, th
				<lb/>energizing of new psycho-physica
				<lb/>centers of being, the activation of a
				<lb/>new Earth-Alchemy, the rewriting of
				<lb/>sacred texts, myth and history, and a
				<lb/>new scanning of the universal system
				<lb/>of hieroglyphics, using trance, med
				<lb/>itation and dream, women artists are
				<lb/>bringing about a planetary goddess
				<lb/>consciousness revolution, a cycle o
				<lb/>female rebirth and a new feminist
				<lb/>ethos in our time.

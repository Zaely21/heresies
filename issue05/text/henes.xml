               <lb/>SUMMER SOLSTICE
               <lb/>lying on a bag of my own breath. falling asleep touching myself. closing my
               <lb/>circuits. settling in-for the solstice waking on the seventh morning of the fast.
               <lb/>spending the day preparing libations in service to ourselves. packing the
               <lb/>preparations. climbing the trails to the cliff on the bay. painting auspicious
               <lb/>symbols of the day on ourselves, using paint made with oil and ashes from our
               <lb/>fire. squatting on the point. rocking ourselves keeping time with the tide.
               <lb/>chanting the sounds of the sun on our solar chakras. sitting simply in a solstice
               <lb/>sentinel watching the longest sun sink into the sea. toasting ourselves with
               <lb/>camomile we’d gathered and dried. in ceremony celebrating a cyclic aware
               <lb/>ness. knowing our own season would have to carry us.

               <lb/>SPRING EQUINOX
            </p>
            <p>
               <lb/>saturday at 6:50 am a group of us celebrated the vernal equinox in the park
               <lb/>across the street in the manner of chinese peasants. there are two physical
               <lb/>manifestatíons of the special pull of gravity at the moment of the equinox
               <lb/>which we attempted. for a time surrounding the equinox it is possible to stand
               <lb/>an egg on end, this is true and we saw it. the egg feels discernibly heavier and
               <lb/>you can feel the yolk moving around on the inside seeking its balance in the
               <lb/>universe. so we stood egg on end in the park and at least one on every
               <lb/>body's counter for the good luck that observing such a phenomena can bring.
               <lb/>the other demonstration is to dig a hole and stand a hollow joint of bamboo in
               <lb/>it leaving about an inch sticking above the ground and drop a goose down
               <lb/>feather into it. at the moment of the equinox the feather flies up out of the
               <lb/>earth. this is true but we did not see it, it coudn't work because the ground in
               <lb/>the park is not really part of the greater ground. for all intents and purposes it's
               <lb/>a flower box sitting on the roof of the parking garage which is on top of the
               <lb/>subway tunnels but anyway just seeing the eggs was enough to erase the ef
               <lb/>feets of an extremely difficult pisces and mark the true beginning of another
               <lb/>cycle.

               <lb/>WINTER SOLSTICE
            </p>
            <p>
               <lb/>yes. reverence to her. the chant on the winter solstice on the full moon on the
               <lb/>beach in the snow in the full spirit of the great round. on the darkest night of
               <lb/>the year in the dark of the snow which obscured the moon and in the company
               <lb/>of nine cars of city state and federal police who forbade the fire on the order
               <lb/>of a superior who had the authority to forbid. but the moon asserted herself in
               <lb/>the huge white waves which contained us in their rhythm and glow and rocked
               <lb/>the chanting into a trance of chanting really chanting. or maybe i myself was
               <lb/>in a trance from the very beginning anyway carrying totems and images of
               <lb/>people i loved in the pockets of my spacesuit chanting my own rites of passage
               <lb/>for myself. and the fire asserted itself too in the form of a delayed due to ex
               <lb/>treme cold chemical reaction calising a spontaneous combustion in the sacri
               <lb/>ficial bowl. it was perfect. a surprise chance to see ourselves only eyes showing
               <lb/>—between ponchos and parkas. chanting in circles around the tiny fire in the
               <lb/>wooden bowl under the white canopy which also appeared spontaneously. and
               <lb/>more chanting. and altered chanting. and invocations and glorifications and in
               <lb/>general much reverence to her. to her to us to each other, and then at a cer
               <lb/>tain point which we all realized together the chanting was over. for this time
               <lb/>and the chanters lined up and passed the unlit fire log by log hand over hand
               <lb/>over beach over fence back into the truck. and hugged and kissed each other
               <lb/>and me and separated in the dark in the snow back in cars and bus back into
               <lb/>the other world.

            </p>
            <p>
               <lb/>tuesday, i dream i am sitting at my green telephone table and i hear a bird
               <lb/>shriek. i run into the studio to investigate. a little bird has flown in and gotten
               <lb/>caught in the space where the two panes of glass of the open window overlap.
               <lb/>it tries to fly thyough the glass and panics flapping up and down in its flat glass
               <lb/>cage, i just reach in and grab it and carry it out to the fire escape. it flies off
               <lb/>immediately, then turns around and flies back and lands on my shoulder. i
               <lb/>send omar inside to get some seeds to feed it he comes back with sesame and,
               <lb/>sunflower seeds on a pie plate which he offers to the bird. and instead of peck
               <lb/>ing at the seeds the bird picks them up with its hand and puts them into its
               <lb/>mouth.
            </p>
            <p>
               <lb/>wednesday. i tell my dream at breakfast.
               <lb/>thursday. i am siting at my green telephone table and i hear a bird shriek. i
               <lb/>run into the studio to investigate. a little bird has flown in and gotten caught
               <lb/>in the space where the two panes of the open window overlap. it tries to fly
               <lb/>through the glass and panics flapping up and down in its flat glass cage. i just
               <lb/>reach in and grab it and carry it out to the fire escape. it flies off immediately
               <lb/>singing
            </p>
            <p>
               <lb/>friday, i tell a wise one about the sequence. and she says "oh yes. and now
               <lb/>you’ll have to be careful what you dream.”

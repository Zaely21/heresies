			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_101_r_5_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>well documented. Analysis has shown the
				<lb facs='#facs_101_r_5_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>ways in which women’s unpaid domestic

				<lb facs='#facs_101_r_5_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>I began to research the ways in which
				<lb facs='#facs_101_r_5_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>the general social organization of male

				<lb facs='#facs_101_r_5_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>female conversations between intimates in
				<lb facs='#facs_101_r_5_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>their homes.
				<lb facs='#facs_101_r_5_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>Initially, I hoped to tape record argu

				<lb facs='#facs_101_r_5_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>discovered that such overt power strug

				<lb facs='#facs_101_r_5_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>talk reveals a division of labor between

				<lb facs='#facs_101_r_5_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>It is not simply two people talking that

				<lb facs='#facs_101_r_2_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>turn. They must be begun, developed and

				<lb facs='#facs_101_r_2_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>speaking is an attempt at producing con
				<lb facs='#facs_101_r_2_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>versation. The question of whether the
				<lb facs='#facs_101_r_2_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>attempt is successful or not depends on
				<lb facs='#facs_101_r_2_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>the participants&apos; willingness to do inter

				<lb facs='#facs_101_r_2_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>stop it right there
				<lb facs='#facs_101_r_2_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>How, then, is the work of interaction
				<lb facs='#facs_101_r_2_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>accomplished in conversations between
				<lb facs='#facs_101_r_2_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>male and female intimates? Who does
				<lb facs='#facs_101_r_2_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>what kind of work? To find out, I listened
				<lb facs='#facs_101_r_2_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>to 52 hours of tape-recorded conversation
				<lb facs='#facs_101_r_2_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>between three couples who had agreed to

				<lb facs='#facs_101_r_2_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>their apartments. The apartments were
				<lb facs='#facs_101_r_2_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>small enough for the recorder to pick up
				<lb facs='#facs_101_r_2_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>all conversation from the kitchen and
				<lb facs='#facs_101_r_2_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>living room as well as louder talk from the
				<lb facs='#facs_101_r_2_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>bedroom and bath. The tape recorder was
				<lb facs='#facs_101_r_2_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>in place from four to 14 days. The tapes
				<lb facs='#facs_101_r_2_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>could run for four hours without interrup

				<lb facs='#facs_101_r_2_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>couples insisted on doing the switching

				<lb facs='#facs_101_r_6_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>from one to four hours. The talk did not

				<lb facs='#facs_101_r_6_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>I made some interesting discoveries
				<lb facs='#facs_101_r_6_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>even before I began my analysis, through
				<lb facs='#facs_101_r_6_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>casual conversations with the people in
				<lb facs='#facs_101_r_6_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>volved in the taping. First, in all three
				<lb facs='#facs_101_r_6_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>cases, the men set up the tape recorders
				<lb facs='#facs_101_r_6_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>and nearly always turned them on and
				<lb facs='#facs_101_r_6_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>off, sometimes without letting the women

				<lb facs='#facs_101_r_6_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>situation in general—not only what wil
				<lb facs='#facs_101_r_6_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>be talked about, but whether there will be

			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_101_r_3_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>conversation, and under what terms it
				<lb facs='#facs_101_r_3_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>will occur. The tape recorder introduced a
				<lb facs='#facs_101_r_3_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>new element into the routine home situa
				<lb facs='#facs_101_r_3_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>tion. Controlling the tape recorder meant

				<lb facs='#facs_101_r_3_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>conversation took place.
				<lb facs='#facs_101_r_3_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>Second, there was the issue of normally
				<lb facs='#facs_101_r_3_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>private interactions being available to a
				<lb facs='#facs_101_r_3_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>third party, the researcher. In addition to

				<lb facs='#facs_101_r_3_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>the tapes, they made other attempts to
				<lb facs='#facs_101_r_3_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>control what I heard. For instance, the
				<lb facs='#facs_101_r_3_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>clicks that are recorded when the machine
				<lb facs='#facs_101_r_3_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>is turned off (and my own sense of the
				<lb facs='#facs_101_r_3_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>conversations) helped me to separate time
				<lb facs='#facs_101_r_3_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>segments. One man carefully erased all
				<lb facs='#facs_101_r_3_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>clicks on his and his partner&apos;s tapes, con
				<lb facs='#facs_101_r_3_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>fusing my attempts to identify different
				<lb facs='#facs_101_r_3_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>time segments.
				<lb facs='#facs_101_r_3_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>The second case was worse. I had made
				<lb facs='#facs_101_r_3_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>the mistake of asking one couple to heli

				<lb facs='#facs_101_r_3_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>of theirs—a conversation about a book
				<lb facs='#facs_101_r_3_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>club selection. In fact, they couldn’t hear
				<lb facs='#facs_101_r_3_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>themselves any better than I could, and
				<lb facs='#facs_101_r_3_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>the man wanted to know why I was
				<lb facs='#facs_101_r_3_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>interested in the conversation. He kept

			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_101_r_8_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>tion, kept saying that only the gist of the

				<lb facs='#facs_101_r_8_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>important, and repeatedly tried to tell me

				<lb facs='#facs_101_r_8_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>These preliminaries already suggested
				<lb facs='#facs_101_r_8_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>that men are more likely than women to
				<lb facs='#facs_101_r_8_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>control conversation. The men made sure

				<lb facs='#facs_101_r_8_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>I listened to all 52 hours of tape and

				<lb facs='#facs_102_r_1_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>did not fail because of anything inherent
				<lb facs='#facs_102_r_1_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>in their talk, but because the men did not

				<lb facs='#facs_102_r_1_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>Questions are a powerful kind of utter

				<lb facs='#facs_102_r_1_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>Q-A is a unit, not two separate things.
				<lb facs='#facs_102_r_1_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>Questions demand answers, while state
				<lb facs='#facs_102_r_1_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>ments do not demand other statements. If
				<lb facs='#facs_102_r_1_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>no answer is given, its absence is notice
				<lb facs='#facs_102_r_1_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>able and can be complained about. A
				<lb facs='#facs_102_r_1_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>question in conversation works by begin

				<lb facs='#facs_102_r_1_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>each of two participants.
				<lb facs='#facs_102_r_1_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>Counting the questions in about seven
				<lb facs='#facs_102_r_1_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>hours of tape, I found that the women
				<lb facs='#facs_102_r_1_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>asked two and a half times more questions
				<lb facs='#facs_102_r_1_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>than the men did—150 to 59. At times, it
				<lb facs='#facs_102_r_1_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>seemed that all the women did was ask
				<lb facs='#facs_102_r_1_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>questions. Then I began noticing my own
				<lb facs='#facs_102_r_1_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>speech and discovered the same pattern. I
				<lb facs='#facs_102_r_1_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>often made questions out of remarks that
				<lb facs='#facs_102_r_1_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>could have been statements: &quot;Isn&apos;t it a

				<lb facs='#facs_102_r_1_1_tl_45' n='N045'/>shopping?&quot; I then tried to break myself of
				<lb facs='#facs_102_r_1_1_tl_46' n='N046'/>the &quot;habit&quot; and found it was difficult.
				<lb facs='#facs_102_r_1_1_tl_47' n='N047'/>Many remarks came out as questions be

				<lb facs='#facs_102_r_1_1_tl_51' n='N051'/>asking so many questions out of habit,
				<lb facs='#facs_102_r_1_1_tl_52' n='N052'/>but because unless I did, my attempts at

				<lb facs='#facs_102_r_1_1_tl_60' n='N060'/>did not, indicating the women’s difficulty

				<lb facs='#facs_102_r_5_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>response. l&apos;ve identified three types of
				<lb facs='#facs_102_r_5_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>attention-getting devices.
				<lb facs='#facs_102_r_5_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>The first was originally discussed by
				<lb facs='#facs_102_r_5_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>Harvey Sacks when he explored children&apos;s
				<lb facs='#facs_102_r_5_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>restricted rights to speak in the presence
				<lb facs='#facs_102_r_5_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>of adults.” Sacks noticed one type of
				<lb facs='#facs_102_r_5_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>question used extensively by children as a
				<lb facs='#facs_102_r_5_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>conversational opening:
				<lb facs='#facs_102_r_5_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>D’ya know
				<lb facs='#facs_102_r_5_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>what?&quot; This type of question is answered
				<lb facs='#facs_102_r_5_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>by another question: &quot;What?&quot; The first
				<lb facs='#facs_102_r_5_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>speaker is then in the position of having
				<lb facs='#facs_102_r_5_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>obtained the attention needed to say what
				<lb facs='#facs_102_r_5_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>he or she wanted to say in the first place.
				<lb facs='#facs_102_r_5_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>This is a Q-Q-A sequence, setting off a
				<lb facs='#facs_102_r_5_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>three-part exchange. Sacks further point
				<lb facs='#facs_102_r_5_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>ed out that while the use of this device
				<lb facs='#facs_102_r_5_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>ensures children&apos;s rights to speak, at the
				<lb facs='#facs_102_r_5_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>same time it acknowledges their restricted
				<lb facs='#facs_102_r_5_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>rights. These three-part sequences in con
				<lb facs='#facs_102_r_5_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>versations tell us about the work of guar

				<lb facs='#facs_102_r_5_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>ing differential rights of the participants.
				<lb facs='#facs_102_r_5_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>In the five hours of my transcripts, the
				<lb facs='#facs_102_r_5_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>women used this device twice as often as
				<lb facs='#facs_102_r_5_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>the men.
				<lb facs='#facs_102_r_5_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>Second, there were many instances of

				<lb facs='#facs_102_r_5_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>an attempt to see if the other person is
				<lb facs='#facs_102_r_5_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>paying attention. It was used 34 times by
				<lb facs='#facs_102_r_5_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>the women and three times by the men.
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_102_r_6_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>The use of the phrase increased as the
				<lb facs='#facs_102_r_6_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>men’s responses decreased.
				<lb facs='#facs_102_r_6_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>Third, &quot;This is interesting,&quot; or a varia
				<lb facs='#facs_102_r_6_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>tion, was used throughout the tapes. By
				<lb facs='#facs_102_r_6_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>engaging in conversation people indicate
				<lb facs='#facs_102_r_6_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>that there is a mutual interest in what is

				<lb facs='#facs_102_r_6_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>worthy of attention. The speaker is work-
				<lb facs='#facs_102_r_6_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>ing to establish the interest of the remark.
				<lb facs='#facs_102_r_6_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>In the five hours of transcribed material,
				<lb facs='#facs_102_r_6_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>the women used this device ten times, the

				<lb facs='#facs_102_r_6_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>actants. The first person makes a remark,
				<lb facs='#facs_102_r_6_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>the second person responds to it, and
				<lb facs='#facs_102_r_6_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>together they establish its joint interest.
				<lb facs='#facs_102_r_6_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>Minimal Response
				<lb facs='#facs_102_r_6_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>A minimal response refers to a speaker
				<lb facs='#facs_102_r_6_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>saying &quot;yeah,&quot; “umm,&quot; &quot;huh,&quot; and little
				<lb facs='#facs_102_r_6_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>more. Both men and women used this
				<lb facs='#facs_102_r_6_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>but often in different ways. The men used
				<lb facs='#facs_102_r_6_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>the monosyllabic response as one step
				<lb facs='#facs_102_r_6_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>short of not responding at all. For exam
				<lb facs='#facs_102_r_6_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>ple, the woman made a long remark, and
				<lb facs='#facs_102_r_6_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>the man responded with &quot;yeah,&quot; which
				<lb facs='#facs_102_r_6_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>neither encouraged her to continue nor

				<lb facs='#facs_103_r_1_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>The women also used this kind of min

				<lb facs='#facs_103_r_1_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>way that is best termed &quot;support work.
				<lb facs='#facs_103_r_1_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>While the man talks, the woman skillfully
				<lb facs='#facs_103_r_1_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>inserts &quot;mmm, &quot;yeah, oh,&quot; throughout
				<lb facs='#facs_103_r_1_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>the stream of talk. By doing this, the
				<lb facs='#facs_103_r_1_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>woman signals that she is paying atten

				<lb facs='#facs_103_r_1_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>speaker’s pauses, seldom causing even
				<lb facs='#facs_103_r_1_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>slight overlaps. Nothing in either tone or
				<lb facs='#facs_103_r_1_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>structure suggests that the woman is try

				<lb facs='#facs_103_r_1_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>Finally, there are statements that do no
				<lb facs='#facs_103_r_1_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>specific conversational work. Of course,
				<lb facs='#facs_103_r_1_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>by its mere existence, a statement pro
				<lb facs='#facs_103_r_1_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>vides for a response, and thereby does
				<lb facs='#facs_103_r_1_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>some minimal work. However, it also
				<lb facs='#facs_103_r_1_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>shows the speaker’s assumption that any
				<lb facs='#facs_103_r_1_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>attempt will be successful and interesting,
				<lb facs='#facs_103_r_1_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>that he or she will be responded to. It is as
				<lb facs='#facs_103_r_1_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>if the speaker assumes there are no prob
				<lb facs='#facs_103_r_1_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>lems, that success is naturally his or hers.
				<lb facs='#facs_103_r_1_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>In the transcribed material, the men made
				<lb facs='#facs_103_r_1_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>this kind of statement more than twice as
				<lb facs='#facs_103_r_1_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>many times as the women. The substance
				<lb facs='#facs_103_r_1_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>of their remarks was not more interesting
				<lb facs='#facs_103_r_1_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>than the women’s, but took on that char
				<lb facs='#facs_103_r_1_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>acter because they generated interaction.
				<lb facs='#facs_103_r_1_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>An Example
				<lb facs='#facs_103_r_1_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>One segment of conversation from my

				<lb facs='#facs_103_r_1_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>tion. The woman is reading a book in her
				<lb facs='#facs_103_r_1_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>academic specialty and the man is making
				<lb facs='#facs_103_r_1_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>a salad. I originally transcribed it for
				<lb facs='#facs_103_r_1_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>analysis because conversation seemed dif

				<lb facs='#facs_103_r_1_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>tegies to ensure some response. I suggest
				<lb facs='#facs_103_r_1_1_tl_45' n='N045'/>reading the transcript before continuing

				<lb facs='#facs_103_r_1_1_tl_47' n='N047'/>The woman (F) starts off in Set I with

				<lb facs='#facs_103_r_1_1_tl_50' n='N050'/>man’s (M’s) attention. It seems to be the
				<lb facs='#facs_103_r_1_1_tl_51' n='N051'/>right assumption, since M’s response in
				<lb facs='#facs_103_r_1_1_tl_52' n='N052'/>Set 3 is minimal and both fall silent. Fs

				<lb facs='#facs_103_r_1_1_tl_59' n='N059'/>7-8. Fs success is short-lived, however; M
				<lb facs='#facs_103_r_1_1_tl_60' n='N060'/>fails to respond to her last contribution
				<lb facs='#facs_103_r_1_1_tl_61' n='N061'/>and thus ends the exchange.

			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_103_r_2_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>“That’s really interesting.&quot; As M makes
				<lb facs='#facs_103_r_2_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>no attempt to follow up on any of her
				<lb facs='#facs_103_r_2_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>statements, F continues talking for 30
				<lb facs='#facs_103_r_2_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>seconds, using two &quot;y’knows&quot; and a ques

				<lb facs='#facs_103_r_2_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>yknow&quot; a third time. Though there are
				<lb facs='#facs_103_r_2_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>further attempts made by F later in the
				<lb facs='#facs_103_r_2_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>interaction, a conversation on this topio
				<lb facs='#facs_103_r_2_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>never develops.
				<lb facs='#facs_103_r_2_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>The transcript shows some ways the
				<lb facs='#facs_103_r_2_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>strategies described earlier are used in
				<lb facs='#facs_103_r_2_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>actual conversation. It shows the woman

				<lb facs='#facs_103_r_2_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>fully. As the interaction develops and F
				<lb facs='#facs_103_r_2_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>becomes more aware of her difficulties, F
				<lb facs='#facs_103_r_2_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>brings more pressure on M by increasing
				<lb facs='#facs_103_r_2_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>her use of strategies. Even so, she only
				<lb facs='#facs_103_r_2_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>ensures immediate, localized responses,
				<lb facs='#facs_103_r_2_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>not a full conversational exchange.
				<lb facs='#facs_103_r_2_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>Immediately following this transcribed

				<lb facs='#facs_103_r_3_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>Conclusions
				<lb facs='#facs_103_r_3_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>There is a division of labor in conversa
				<lb facs='#facs_103_r_3_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>tion. Though the women generally do
				<lb facs='#facs_103_r_3_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>more work, the men usually control the
				<lb facs='#facs_103_r_3_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>conversations couples have. Since the
				<lb facs='#facs_103_r_3_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>men s remarks develop into conversation
				<lb facs='#facs_103_r_3_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>more often than the women s, men end up
				<lb facs='#facs_103_r_3_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>defining what will be talked about and
				<lb facs='#facs_103_r_3_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>which aspects of reality are the most
				<lb facs='#facs_103_r_3_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>important.
				<lb facs='#facs_103_r_3_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>Women are required to do specific
				<lb facs='#facs_103_r_3_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>kinds of interactional work in conversa
				<lb facs='#facs_103_r_3_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>tions with men. More than that, we are
				<lb facs='#facs_103_r_3_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>generally required to be available. The

				<lb facs='#facs_103_r_3_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>differs according to the situation; some

				<lb facs='#facs_103_r_3_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>&quot;good listeners, because we are not
				<lb facs='#facs_103_r_3_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>otherwise needed. We may have to fill
				<lb facs='#facs_103_r_3_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>silences and keep conversations moving.
				<lb facs='#facs_103_r_3_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>Sometimes we are supposed to develop
				<lb facs='#facs_103_r_3_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>other people’s topics and other times to
				<lb facs='#facs_103_r_3_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>present and develop topics of our own.
				<lb facs='#facs_103_r_3_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>There are subtle demands on women to
				<lb facs='#facs_103_r_3_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>be available for interaction. If women do
				<lb facs='#facs_103_r_3_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>not answer these demands—if we are not
				<lb facs='#facs_103_r_3_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>naturally” available, we get in trouble.
				<lb facs='#facs_103_r_3_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>Women who sit silently while a conversa-
				<lb facs='#facs_103_r_3_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>tion flounders are seen as hostile or inept.
				<lb facs='#facs_103_r_3_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>Women who consistently and successfully
				<lb facs='#facs_103_r_3_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>control interactions are criticized, particu
				<lb facs='#facs_103_r_3_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>larly by men who question the female’s
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_103_r_5_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>status as a woman. They are likely to be

				<lb facs='#facs_103_r_5_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>gressive. When women attempt even
				<lb facs='#facs_103_r_5_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>temporarily to control conversation with
				<lb facs='#facs_103_r_5_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>men, it often starts an argument.
				<lb facs='#facs_103_r_5_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>Women who do not behave interac-
				<lb facs='#facs_103_r_5_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>tionally are punished; often it is implied
				<lb facs='#facs_103_r_5_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>that they are not “real women. One&apos;s
				<lb facs='#facs_103_r_5_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>sexual identity is crucial. It is the most

				<lb facs='#facs_103_r_5_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>there is. But it is not simply our bodies
				<lb facs='#facs_103_r_5_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>that define gender. We must constantly
				<lb facs='#facs_103_r_5_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>behave as male or female in order for our
				<lb facs='#facs_103_r_5_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>gender to be taken for granted in interac

				<lb facs='#facs_103_r_5_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>tinually.

				<lb facs='#facs_103_r_5_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>quires women to be available to do what
				<lb facs='#facs_103_r_5_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>ever needs to be done in interactions.
				<lb facs='#facs_103_r_5_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>Since interactional work is tied up with
				<lb facs='#facs_103_r_5_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>female identity, with what a woman is,
				<lb facs='#facs_103_r_5_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>the fact that it is work is obscured. It is
				<lb facs='#facs_103_r_5_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>not seen as something we do, but as part
				<lb facs='#facs_103_r_5_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>of what we are, similar to caring for the
				<lb facs='#facs_103_r_5_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>house and children, which have also been
				<lb facs='#facs_103_r_5_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>seen as part and parcel of what women
				<lb facs='#facs_103_r_5_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>are. In both cases, the value and necessity
				<lb facs='#facs_103_r_5_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>of the work are hidden behind the screen
				<lb facs='#facs_103_r_5_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>of the sexual division of labor.
				<lb facs='#facs_103_r_5_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>This view is influenced by the work in con

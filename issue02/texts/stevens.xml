               <l>Moving from chair to bed to table she opens the</l>
               <l>door to the field, waits to receive words of praise</l>
               <l>and affection. The days of no figure crossing the</l>
               <l>field have moved to this moment. We are together.</l>
               <l>We drive off. She has nothing to say. She is humming.</l>

               <l>As children in Chatham Alice and her sister Mary</l>
               <l>went for picnics on a boat down the River Miramichi</l>
               <l>as far as Bav de Vin and Burnt Church where the boat</l>
               <l>turned around. They caried sandwiches and lemon</l>
               <l>meringue pie homemade by Nelle Morn who hooked</l>
               <l>five or six rugs a vear, took in laundry, baked</l>
               <l>and sold fresh bread in herstore, made all the</l>
               <l>familv s clothes and delivered milk to her neishbors.</l>
               <l>Three of her four children were girls but they never</l>
               <l>learned to do allthe things their mother did. She</l>
               <l>had no time to teach them.</l>
               <l>Alice was in the second grade when Nellie Morn threw</l>
               <l>a log from the top of the woodpile into Alice's left</l>
               <l>eye. Her blue dress turned red.</l>
               <l>Alice was twelve when her father died. She went to work</l>
               <l>as mothers helper for the Snowballs and the Steeds</l>
               <l>who lived in the big house on the hill. Thev owned the</l>
               <l>pulp mill.</l>
               <l>Later she came to Boston, got a job in a Chinese</l>
               <l>restaurant where she waited on True N. Stevens half-</l>
               <l>owner of Stevens and Greene Groceries and his boy Ralph</l>
               <l>who flirted with her. Asked what A.D. on the bill stood</l>
               <l>for she said after dinner. They got married. She was</l>
               <l>twenty-four. I was the first of their two children</l>
               <l>the one who lived.</l>
               <l>She is nearly eighty now. She has a pink-gummed smile</l>
               <l>incredibly innocent and sweet without the least inflec-</l>
               <l>tion of twenty vears confinement in the back wards of</l>
               <l>state mental hospitals. The light in the one eye that</l>
               <l>sees has never gone out.</l>

               <l>Loosened strands slip down deep divided back.</l>
               <l>Buttocks shelfslides to creasing thighs. Knees</l>
               <l>keep a partial crouch. Belly slings body center</l>
               <l>forward over a hairless pouch. She lifts each breast</l>
               <l>soaping the smell of age. She (matter self-propelled</l>
               <l>mushrooms pink and lavender, lustful, greedy, feeding)</l>
               <l>steps into air, hands stroking space, trusting someone</l>
               <l>is there to towel her drv, pin remnant hair, give back</l>
               <l>her name, her watch, her storv. She loves being clean</l>
               <l>but who has time to wash her every day? Is she a baby</l>
               <l>with a future? She loves hair dresed but fears over</l>
               <l>handling may make it thin. Dampish stil, flushed,</l>
               <l>talced, her body blooming, she swings foot, hums</l>
               <l>nightgowned beside the bed, waits for milk and pills.</l>
               <l>Glasses folded under pillow, sheet clutched high,</l>
               <l>one hand slipped between her thighs, she sleeps a</l>
               <l>sleep she will denv, in tongues converses with</l>
               <l>familiars, unshareable. No she did not speak she lies</l>
               <l>keeping her secret garden, loving the long continuous</l>
               <l>dialog, absorbing, obsessing, warm and sweet as ex-</l>
               <l>crement newly made, unspeakable, but hers, and real.</l>

				<lb facs='#facs_121_r_1_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>sider it generically as any form of communication which is per
				<lb facs='#facs_121_r_1_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>ceived as humorous by any of the interacting parties. “Women’s
				<lb facs='#facs_121_r_1_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>humor&quot; is used to connote humor created by women and dealing
				<lb facs='#facs_121_r_1_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>in some way with woman’s role in the human condition. Of the
				<lb facs='#facs_121_r_1_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>various theories, the psycho-sociological approach, stressing the
				<lb facs='#facs_121_r_1_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>notion of humor as social interchange, may be most fruitful for
				<lb facs='#facs_121_r_1_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>our purposes. Humor is potentially part of every social structure
				<lb facs='#facs_121_r_1_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>and affects all social systems. When the subject is relationships
				<lb facs='#facs_121_r_1_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>between women and men, men are traditionally permitted to
				<lb facs='#facs_121_r_1_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>tease or make fun of women, who in turn are required to take no
				<lb facs='#facs_121_r_1_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>offense; in fact, we are frequently expected to join in the &quot;fun,
				<lb facs='#facs_121_r_1_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>even though it is at our own expense. This context is similar to
				<lb facs='#facs_121_r_1_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>that of racist humor—gratifying one group at the expense of the
				<lb facs='#facs_121_r_1_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>underdog; its purpose is to throw blame on some group and to
				<lb facs='#facs_121_r_1_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>reinforce its inferior position. In this process the role of the
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_121_r_2_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>scapegoat itself is vital. Generally, as O. E. Klapp points out, the
				<lb facs='#facs_121_r_2_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>scapegoat has a specific socially defined role and position. To the
				<lb facs='#facs_121_r_2_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>dominant group, &quot;the fool represents values which are rejected by
				<lb facs='#facs_121_r_2_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>the group, causes that are lost, incompetence, failure, and fi
				<lb facs='#facs_121_r_2_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>asco.&quot;“ The fool’s position is degraded, but simultaneously val
				<lb facs='#facs_121_r_2_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>ued—s/he serves as the scapegoat, the butt of humor, the cathar
				<lb facs='#facs_121_r_2_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>tic symbol of aggression. But even beyond that, Klapp suggests
				<lb facs='#facs_121_r_2_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>that there is an underlying, continuous, collective process that
				<lb facs='#facs_121_r_2_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>ascribes this fool’s role to a group of people as a means of
				<lb facs='#facs_121_r_2_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>enforcing conformity, maintaining the status quo, pressuring for
				<lb facs='#facs_121_r_2_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>status adjustments, or simply eliminating an undesired form of
				<lb facs='#facs_121_r_2_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>deviance. In fact, this has been one of the components of every

				<lb facs='#facs_122_r_2_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>answer is that for the most part, there weren’t any. Yes, there

				<lb facs='#facs_122_r_2_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>one or two others, but generally there has been no women’s

				<lb facs='#facs_122_r_2_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>Why not? Women have been identifiable as a group in every

				<lb facs='#facs_122_r_2_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>emulated it and its values, making the same kind of disparaging

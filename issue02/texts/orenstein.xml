               <lb facs='#facs_52_l_1689' n='N001'/>Anais Nin is a writer. She was born in
               <lb facs='#facs_52_r_3_1_tl_1' n='N002'/>1920 in Neuilly near Paris. When she was
               <lb facs='#facs_52_r_3_1_tl_2' n='N003'/>eleven her father left her. He was a Span
               <lb facs='#facs_52_r_3_1_tl_3' n='N004'/>ish pianist. Her mother, a Spanish dancer,
               <lb facs='#facs_52_r_3_1_tl_4' n='N005'/>lived with her and her brother. When her
               <lb facs='#facs_52_r_3_1_tl_5' n='N006'/>father left her she started writing a diary.
               <lb facs='#facs_52_r_3_1_tl_6' n='N007'/>It was really a letter to her father to try to
               <lb facs='#facs_52_r_3_1_tl_7' n='N008'/>get him to come back to her.
               <lb facs='#facs_52_r_3_1_tl_8' n='N009'/>The family was living in Richmond Hill
               <lb facs='#facs_52_r_3_1_tl_9' n='N010'/>in Queens and her father went to Paris to
               <lb facs='#facs_52_r_3_1_tl_10' n='N011'/>become a famous pianist. She had even
               <lb facs='#facs_52_r_3_1_tl_11' n='N012'/>actually sent him a letter, only her mother
               <lb facs='#facs_52_r_3_1_tl_12' n='N013'/>didn’t mail it and said it had gotten lost in
               <lb facs='#facs_52_r_3_1_tl_13' n='N014'/>the mail. When she was about 24 years
               <lb facs='#facs_52_r_3_1_tl_14' n='N015'/>old she wrote some very beautiful poems
               <lb facs='#facs_52_r_3_1_tl_15' n='N016'/>and stories but since she was a woman
               <lb facs='#facs_52_r_3_1_tl_16' n='N017'/>(and there weren’t many women writers)
               <lb facs='#facs_52_r_3_1_tl_17' n='N018'/>no one would publish her works. But
               <lb facs='#facs_52_r_3_1_tl_18' n='N019'/>Anais Nin thought that they were good
               <lb facs='#facs_52_r_3_1_tl_19' n='N020'/>enough to be published; so she set up a
               <lb facs='#facs_52_r_3_1_tl_20' n='N021'/>printing press and she published all her
               <lb facs='#facs_52_r_3_1_tl_21' n='N022'/>works herself. Since then they have be
               <lb facs='#facs_52_r_3_1_tl_22' n='N023'/>come very famous.
               <lb facs='#facs_52_r_3_1_tl_23' n='N024'/>Anais Nin’s career started very late
               <lb facs='#facs_52_r_3_1_tl_24' n='N025'/>and, still today, she is writing some of her
               <lb facs='#facs_52_r_3_1_tl_25' n='N026'/>best novels and stories.
               <lb facs='#facs_52_r_3_1_tl_26' n='N027'/>Anais Nin is unlike most people. When
               <lb facs='#facs_52_r_3_1_tl_27' n='N028'/>she dreams she wants these dreams to
               <lb facs='#facs_52_r_3_1_tl_28' n='N029'/>come true. She says that dreams won&apos;t
               <lb facs='#facs_52_r_3_1_tl_29' n='N030'/>come to you. You have to make them
               <lb facs='#facs_52_r_3_1_tl_30' n='N031'/>come true. Once she dreamed about a nice
               <lb facs='#facs_52_r_3_1_tl_31' n='N032'/>big houseboat. Then she saw an ad for a
               <lb facs='#facs_52_r_3_1_tl_32' n='N033'/>houseboat on the Seine in the newspaper.
               <lb facs='#facs_52_r_3_1_tl_33' n='N034'/>She bought the houseboat and moved into

               <lb facs='#facs_52_r_8_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>she became a Spanish dancer. (Since he
               <lb facs='#facs_52_r_8_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>was a Spanish pianist she figured he could
               <lb facs='#facs_52_r_8_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>play and she could dance.) She performed
               <lb facs='#facs_52_r_8_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>in Paris under the name Anita Aguilera
               <lb facs='#facs_52_r_8_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>and even though she was a writer and was
               <lb facs='#facs_52_r_8_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>doing it for her father, she was a very
               <lb facs='#facs_52_r_8_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>good dancer.

               <lb facs='#facs_52_r_8_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>to Djuna Barnes and she never received an
               <lb facs='#facs_52_r_8_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>answer, so she decided to answer all her
               <lb facs='#facs_52_r_8_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>mail if she ever became famous. Even

               <lb facs='#facs_53_r_23_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>A friend once told me about a feminist workshop in which each woman was asked to acknowledge her matrilineal ancestry by
               <lb facs='#facs_53_r_23_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>repeating the phrase: &quot;I am the daughter of ...&quot; and then naming her mother. To everyone’s amazement, many of the women in that
               <lb facs='#facs_53_r_23_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>small, randomly selected group spontaneously responded: “T am the daughter of Anais Nin.
               <lb facs='#facs_53_r_23_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>A major theme of the women’s movement has been that biology is not destiny. Therefore a doctor’s words to the youthful Anais are
               <lb facs='#facs_53_r_23_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>ironic: “You were not built for maternity.&quot; Instead of becoming a biological mother, Anais Nin was the spiritual mother to an entire
               <lb facs='#facs_53_r_23_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>generation of women writers. As a biological mother and a feminist, I can think of no greater gift to my own children than a spiritual
               <lb facs='#facs_53_r_23_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>parent. It was with this in mind that in 1974 I suggested that my ten-year-old, Claudia, contact Anais Nin.
               <lb facs='#facs_53_r_23_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>One of Anais’ recurring motifs has been the transcendence of loss through artistic creation. I wanted to share this motif with my
               <lb facs='#facs_53_r_23_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>daughter. My husband and I had recently separated. I was teaching a college course on Anais Nin’s Diaries. I began to realize how very
               <lb facs='#facs_53_r_23_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>much like my own children Anais had felt when her father left her at approximately the same age. Claudia’s English class project was to
               <lb facs='#facs_53_r_23_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>write the biography of a famous person. She had chosen Shakespeare, but was making little progress. It occurred to me that the painful
               <lb facs='#facs_53_r_23_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>after-effects of her parents’ separation might be connected to this “writing block.&quot; But I found myself in the position of being unable to
               <lb facs='#facs_53_r_23_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>help her at the time she needed me precisely because I was her mother. The person my children missed most in the world was the person
               <lb facs='#facs_53_r_23_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>against whom I harbored extremely bitter sentiments. I felt torn between my own anger and my children’s need for me to understand that
               <lb facs='#facs_53_r_23_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>they still loved their father. I knew instinctively that Anais Nin, through the Diaries, could do the spiritual mothering I found impossible,
               <lb facs='#facs_53_r_23_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>that reading about how she had used her own pain as a source óf creative energy might give Claudia confidence that childhood wounds
               <lb facs='#facs_53_r_23_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>could be overcome.
               <lb facs='#facs_53_r_23_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>When I spoke to Claudia about Anais, she perked up and instantly switched her topic from Shakespeare to Nin. Then she wrote to
               <lb facs='#facs_53_r_23_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>Anais, telling her about the project and asking if there were any possibility of obtaining the childhood journal, written, as Anais tells us
               <lb facs='#facs_53_r_23_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>&quot;as a diary of a journey to record everything for my father. It was written for him and I had really intended to send it to him. It was really
               <lb facs='#facs_53_r_23_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>a letter so he could follow us into a strange land, know about us.&quot; Claudia included some of her own poetry with her letter and soon
               <lb facs='#facs_53_r_23_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>received an enthusiastic response.
               <lb facs='#facs_53_r_23_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>If Anais Nin’s Diaries can speak personally to a child of ten, it is because Nin herself has never lost sight of the child she was. It is this
               <lb facs='#facs_53_r_23_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>intermingling of past, present and future that gives the Diaries their universal and timeless ap peal for the young and old alike. She says in
               <lb facs='#facs_53_r_23_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>the fourth Diary: “We live back and forth in the past or in the present or in the future. With the young one lives in the future. I prefer
               <lb facs='#facs_53_r_23_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>that. Changes occur constantly according to the vision, image or myth that possesses one..... We never discard our childhood. We
               <lb facs='#facs_53_r_23_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>never escape it completely ... The young’s attraction for the old is the protection of their future. The need of faith and the elder’s vision
               <lb facs='#facs_53_r_23_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>into the future.&quot; If, as Anais states, “changes occur according to the myth we are possessed by,” it is no wonder that those who read the
               <lb facs='#facs_53_r_23_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>Diaries and become possessed by the myth of transcendence through creation undergo the therapeutic effects of a transpersonal healing. It
               <lb facs='#facs_53_r_23_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>was precisely this faith in the future and the elder’s vision that I wanted to pass on to my daughter and that caused just such a psychic
               <lb facs='#facs_53_r_23_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>healing to take place.
               <lb facs='#facs_53_r_23_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>I think Claudia was helped most in handling that difficult period in her life by the knowledge she gained from Anaïs that reality need

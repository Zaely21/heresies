            <p> HERESIES is an idea-oriented journal devoted to the examination of art and politics
               from a feminist perspective. We believe that what is commonly called art can have a
               political impact, and that in the making of art and of all cultural artifacts our
               identities as women play a distinct role. We hope that HERESIES will stimulate
               dialogue around radical political and aesthetic theory, encourage the writing of the
               history of femina sapiens, and generate new creative energies among women. It will be
               a place where diversity can be articulated. We are committed to the broadening of the
               definition and function of art.</p>
            <p> HERESIES is structured as a collective of feminists, some of whom are also
               socialists, marxists, lesbian feminists or anarchists; our fields include painting,
               sculpture, writing, anthropology, literature, performance, art history, architecture
               and filmmaking. While the themes of the individual issues will be determined by the
               collective, each issue will have a different editorial staff made up of contributors
               as well as members of the collective. Each issue will take a different visual form,
               chosen by the group responsible. HERESIES will try to be accountable to and in touch
               with the international feminist community. An open evaluation meeting will be held
               after the appearance of each issue. Themes will be announced well in advance in order
               to collect material from many sources. (See inside of back cover for list of
               projected issues.) Possibly satellite pamphlets and broadsides will be produced
               continuing the discussion of each central theme.</p>
            <p> As women, we are aware that historically the connections between our lives, our arts
               and our ideas have been suppressed. Once these connections are clarified they can
               function as a means to dissolve the alienation between artist and audience, and to
               understand the relationship between art and politics, work and workers. As a step
               toward a demystification of art, we reject the standard relationship of criticism to
               art within the present system, which has often become the relationship of advertiser
               to product. We will not advertise a new set of genius-products just because they are
               made by women. We are not committed to any particular style or aesthetic, nor to the
               competitive mentality that pervades the art world. Our view of feminism is one of
               process and change, and we feel that ir the process of this dialogue we can foster a
               change in the meaning of art.</p>

            <p> This issue of HERESIES was edited and produced by three groups which met separately
               and together for more than four months: a nine-woman editorial collective, which
               takes final responsibility for the magazine; an eight-woman adjunct group which
               worked on general ideas, research and specific articles; and a five-woman
               design/production group. Still other women helped with additional aspects, such as
               copyediting, proofreading and mechanicals, and the larger HERESIES Collective
               supported us all. Because of the number of women involved and the number of
               manuscripts received (more than twice as many as were submitted to our first issue),
               the process was complex. Editorial work was new to most of us, and we needed a lot of
               time to listen to each other, to reflect on our disparate experiences and
               viewpointsâand to develop an overview of the magazine, which finally affected our
               decisions almost as much as individual submissions. We worked collectively on each
               piece, arriving at a consensus only after much discussion. Sometimes we frustrated
               those authors and artists who had hoped to hear more from us sooner. As we worked, we
               found that we were indeed involved in a process of communication with all the women
               who wanted to participate in this issue, as well as with each other. If this process
               was at times confusing, it was also intensely satisfying. </p>
            <p> As this issue went into production, Ree Morton, an artist whose friendship, work and
               commitment to feminism made her close to many ofus, died of injuries sustained in an
               automobile accident. We will miss her. </p>

            <head>Magic Songs</head>
            <byline>Collected by Anne Twitty*</byline>
            <note>* From a collection begun while working with Julia Blackburn, who found two of the
               poems.</note>
            <p>Magic is a universal language, a technique for transformation. It works by binding or
               loosing, invoking, destroying, leading away. Wherever they were, the women who said
               or chanted these incantations had the same purposes—they wanted to stop the flow of
               blood or start the flow of milk, to ease childbirth, to send a fever back into the
               forest it came from. For them, the word was not the refuge of the helpless but a
               medicine or a thunderbolt, a sacramental tool. Their words were acts. </p>
            <lg>
               <l>The child's mother first wipes her sexual organ with the shirt and </l>
               <l>then the child's face, saying: </l>
               <l>Flee marvel from marvel. </l>
               <l>Here is a greater marvel. </l>
               <l>White partridges flew by and brought white milk. </l>
               <l>They pour it out of the stone, </l>
               <l>they pour it round out of the stone. </l>
               <l>One hand fastens the sleeve of the other. </l>
               <l>The axe by itself cuts the Evil Eyes. </l>
               <l>Let the Evil Eyes melt away </l>
               <l>like bees over the flowers, </l>
               <l>like lard on the coals, </l>
               <l>like foam on muddy water. </l>
               <l>We shall tread over the water, </l>
               <l>we shall make the Evil Eyes wither and dry up, </l>
               <l>that they appear no more</l>

            <note>A southern Slav charm collected by Phyllis Kemp, who practiced medicine there
               before World War II, and made an extensive study of folk medicine/magic.</note>

               <l>The god comes on the rainbow </l>
               <l>to his shrine. </l>
               <l>He comes with the red rain </l>
               <l>and the blue. </l>
               <l>It is the sign of the god. </l>
               <l>He comes down here to earth. </l>
               <l>Dance, all ye children of his!</l>

            <note>From Ifaluk Atoll, an island south of the Marianas, where the women write all the
               poetry. This is an invitation to a god.</note>

               University of Washington Press, Seattle, 1963, p. 353.)</bibl>

            </lg>
            <note>From Adayme, Africa. The pregnant woman is bound with magic strings. Then, as the
               charm is said, line by line, each string is cut. First around the head, then the
               neck, then the waist, the knees and the feet.</note>

               Anthropologist, v. 29, 1927, p. 178; Twitty version.)</bibl>

            <note>Gypsy. The Earth Woman is thought to suckle children so that they refuse their
               mother's milk. She has many sister spirits child-stealers and child-destroyers like
               the Hebrew Lilith and the Islamic Karina—who appear to be destroying shadows, the
               woman's double.</note>

				<lb facs='#facs_105_r_2_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>greed and ambition; and a commitment to the land, however
				<lb facs='#facs_105_r_2_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>bleak. These are recurring themes in the broken threads of
				<lb facs='#facs_105_r_2_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>Canadian culture, the most timely of which is that of the loner,

				<lb facs='#facs_105_r_2_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>a phenomenon common in world history —men who see them

				<lb facs='#facs_106_r_1_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>Canadian filmmaking was small, there was at least room for
				<lb facs='#facs_106_r_1_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>women’s participation in key roles. As in most professions at the
				<lb facs='#facs_106_r_1_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>earliest stages, there was no rigid role tradition to prevent women
				<lb facs='#facs_106_r_1_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>definitively from any or all interests or occupations. Most of the
				<lb facs='#facs_106_r_1_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>women active in early Canadian filmmaking did, however, work
				<lb facs='#facs_106_r_1_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>in husband-and-wife production teams. They shared the work-
				<lb facs='#facs_106_r_1_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>rarely the credit. Only recently was Nell Shipman correctly cred

				<lb facs='#facs_106_r_1_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>since its inception in 1941. John Grierson, founder and director of
				<lb facs='#facs_106_r_1_1_tl_45' n='N045'/>the NFB, believed that the organizational skills and talents of
				<lb facs='#facs_106_r_1_1_tl_46' n='N046'/>librarians were ideal credentials for beginning filmmakers. Much
				<lb facs='#facs_106_r_1_1_tl_47' n='N047'/>to the surprise of the women librarians he hired, not to mention
				<lb facs='#facs_106_r_1_1_tl_48' n='N048'/>that of the established filmmakers, the ensuing films did in fact
				<lb facs='#facs_106_r_1_1_tl_49' n='N049'/>prove the skill of these women. So it was that in the 1940s

				<lb facs='#facs_106_r_1_1_tl_56' n='N056'/>1940s, women played key roles. For the next twenty-five years
				<lb facs='#facs_106_r_1_1_tl_57' n='N057'/>they did not, and only in 1969, with Sylvia Spring’s first feature

				<lb facs='#facs_106_r_1_1_tl_61' n='N061'/>the production of feature films radically decreased, often to the

			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_106_r_2_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>tunities in film, Canadian women were getting fewer—or none. As
				<lb facs='#facs_106_r_2_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>is the case in all other professions and classes, competition among
				<lb facs='#facs_106_r_2_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>male filmmakers is such that female inclusion would only make it
				<lb facs='#facs_106_r_2_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>worse, and in every aspect of the industry women have been
				<lb facs='#facs_106_r_2_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>deterred from participation. Second, in keeping with the general

				<lb facs='#facs_106_r_4_1_tl_7' n='N005'/>During the 1920s two factions in the American film industry
				<lb facs='#facs_106_r_4_1_tl_8' n='N006'/>battled over methods of expansion. The struggle was between the
				<lb facs='#facs_106_r_4_1_tl_9' n='N007'/>independents (producers and exhibitors) and the monopolists,
				<lb facs='#facs_106_r_4_1_tl_10' n='N008'/>who favored “vertical integration“ — bringing all aspects of film
				<lb facs='#facs_106_r_4_1_tl_11' n='N009'/>making, distribution and exhibition under the control of the big
				<lb facs='#facs_106_r_4_1_tl_12' n='N010'/>production studios. Under the guidance of Adolph Zukor, the
				<lb facs='#facs_106_r_4_1_tl_13' n='N011'/>monopolists won, and independent filmmaking in both Canada
				<lb facs='#facs_106_r_4_1_tl_14' n='N012'/>and the United States was wiped out. In 1948 the U.S. legislated
				<lb facs='#facs_106_r_4_1_tl_15' n='N013'/>against this kind of control, and distribution and exhibition were
				<lb facs='#facs_106_r_4_1_tl_16' n='N014'/>separated from production, allowing the resurrection of an inde

				<lb facs='#facs_106_r_4_1_tl_18' n='N016'/>no such legislation has been passed; foreign companies are

				<lb facs='#facs_106_r_4_1_tl_20' n='N018'/>and the existence of a commercial Canadian film industry is effec

				<lb facs='#facs_106_r_4_1_tl_22' n='N020'/>&quot;independent, and yet there is no parallel &quot;independent&quot; system
				<lb facs='#facs_106_r_4_1_tl_23' n='N021'/>for distribution and exhibition.

				<lb facs='#facs_107_r_2_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>Canadian women have made a considerable number of films over

				<lb facs='#facs_107_r_2_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>forces that exploit her. In La Vie Rêvée the two female leads are
				<lb facs='#facs_107_r_2_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>friends (a rare relationship for women in film) who work for a

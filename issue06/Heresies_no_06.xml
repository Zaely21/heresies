				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_4_1_tl_2' n='N001'/>We came together almost a year ago to examine violence. We operated as a
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_4_1_tl_3' n='N002'/>study group, a work group and a support group. Our individual reasons for
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_4_1_tl_4' n='N003'/>joining together to work on this issue included years of involvement in work-
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_4_1_tl_5' n='N004'/>place organizing, work with tortured political prisoners in Chile, work with
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_4_1_tl_6' n='N005'/>battered women in New York City, three years' work as a whore; to substanti-
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_4_1_tl_7' n='N006'/>ate a psycho-sexual curiosity in violence; being molested and beaten by a
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_4_1_tl_8' n='N007'/>father, being raised by working-class communist parents, being lesbian, being
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_4_1_tl_9' n='N008'/>Indian in a White supremacist society. And all of us shared a commitment, as
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_4_1_tl_10' n='N009'/>women, to the radical restructuring of this society.
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_4_1_tl_11' n='N010'/>Readings and discussions about our individual experiences have helped us
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_4_1_tl_12' n='N011'/>clarify the inextricable connection between power, control and privilege: that
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_4_1_tl_13' n='N012'/>violence, in its broadest sense, is essential in maintaining any unequal relation
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_4_1_tl_14' n='N013'/>ship. We were forced to abandon linear notions about the causes, functions and
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_4_1_tl_15' n='N014'/>manifestations of violence and to replace them with an understanding that was
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_4_1_tl_16' n='N015'/>both multidimensional and itself a process.
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_4_1_tl_17' n='N016'/>In one-to-one relations, most of us at times have felt in control, powerful:
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_4_1_tl_18' n='N017'/>mothers over children, whores over tricks, females withholding something a
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_4_1_tl_19' n='N018'/>male wants. In a larger sense, however, this power is relative. If the laws, jobs,
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_4_1_tl_20' n='N019'/>money, and values that affect our lives are determined by men with power, then
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_4_1_tl_21' n='N020'/>the personal power we experience as mother, whore or girlfriend is never out-
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_4_1_tl_22' n='N021'/>side of this context.
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_4_1_tl_23' n='N022'/>Actual power can be elusive, not something you can hold in your hand. Pow-
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_4_1_tl_24' n='N023'/>er does not have a life of its own, but is established over and over again through
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_4_1_tl_25' n='N024'/>interaction. The power of some individuals, whether a caseworker, a husband
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_4_1_tl_26' n='N025'/>or a boss, and some institutions over others is culturally sanctioned and
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_4_1_tl_27' n='N026'/>enforced.
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_4_1_tl_28' n='N027'/>We recognize that violence is woven throughout the fabric of all social struc-
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_4_1_tl_29' n='N028'/>tures and that this violence is experienced differently according to cultural,
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_4_1_tl_30' n='N029'/>racial, sexual, class, ethnic, age and national identity. Those of us who are poor
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_4_1_tl_31' n='N030'/>in a classist society, Third World in a racist society, female in a sexist society,
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_4_1_tl_32' n='N031'/>homosexual in a heterosexist society know daily the violence directed at us be-
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_4_1_tl_33' n='N032'/>cause of who we are and the importance of uniting along these lines. But to
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_4_1_tl_34' n='N033'/>examine class and not race, class and race but not sex, or sex and nothing else,
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_4_1_tl_35' n='N034'/>perpetuates our isolation and undercuts the clarity of our analysis and the
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_4_1_tl_36' n='N035'/>strength of our united action.
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_4_1_tl_37' n='N036'/>Women have always fought back. We have fought for survival, for change
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_4_1_tl_38' n='N037'/>and for revolution. Recognizing and examining our identity as a gender class
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_4_1_tl_39' n='N038'/>enables us to challenge one of the most deep-rooted and long-lasting instances
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_4_1_tl_40' n='N039'/>of domination: that of men over women
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_4_1_tl_41' n='N040'/>Feminism takes as a central assumption that women as women are every
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_4_1_tl_42' n='N041'/>where oppressed. The nature of this oppression may be modified by the partic-
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_4_1_tl_43' n='N042'/>ular male-dominated social system that a woman is part of, but as variable as
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_4_1_tl_44' n='N043'/>male domination may be, the central feature of the relations between the sexes
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_4_1_tl_45' n='N044'/>is differential access to societal resources and expropriation of one group's
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_4_1_tl_46' n='N045'/>labor power by another group. So not only are women oppressed by social
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_4_1_tl_47' n='N046'/>custom and laws that deny them economic self-sufficiency, political visibility
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_4_1_tl_48' n='N047'/>and social status vis-à-vis men, but the labor power of all women (including
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_4_1_tl_49' n='N048'/>productive and reproductive) is ultimately under the control of men.
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_4_1_tl_50' n='N049'/>We have been working toward an issue that is more than a documentation of
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_4_1_tl_51' n='N050'/>the violence endured by women throughout herstory or a simple collection of
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_4_1_tl_52' n='N051'/>individual solutions. We have been working toward an issue that will stimulate
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_4_1_tl_53' n='N052'/>debate and contribute to the momentum of women effecting radical change.
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_4_1_tl_54' n='N053'/>Within the intersection of gender, violence and power exists one of the keys to
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_4_1_tl_55' n='N054'/>understanding oppression and resistance.

				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_2_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>Washing machine went downhill slow,
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_2_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>like my marriage. Each time it got worse, I
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_2_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>wasn't sure: Hadn't it worked like that be-
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_2_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>fore? After all, like me, it was a small ma
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_2_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>chine had to do a big job. No wonder it
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_2_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>clanked. No wonder it shook, rattled, and
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_2_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>rolled on dry spin, shaking the dishes in
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_2_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>my kitchen cupboard like it was ready to
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_2_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>send them and me heavenward. Baby
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_2_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>Jesus, I'm ready, listen, I'm ready.
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_2_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>The way that machine made a racket,
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_2_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>I'm telling you, it scared me sometimes
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_2_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>like I scare my kid. Maybe that's why I
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_2_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>didn't call the repair company for so long.
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_2_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>Knew I wouldn't hurt my kid—that I'd
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_2_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>keep feeding and rocking him no matter
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_2_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>how mad he made me. Guess I thought
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_2_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>the machine had my same mentality:
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_2_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>What I mean is, in my idea, it would
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_2_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>grumble and holler but it would keep on
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_2_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>washing. Or maybe since I knew there was
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_2_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>no repairman coming around for me, I
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_2_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>felt hopeless in the same way about the
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_2_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>machine. Yesterday, though, sun broke
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_2_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>out and I called the company.
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_2_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>Now another reason I couldn't believe
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_2_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>my machine was breaking so bad: It was
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_2_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>practically new. Bought it three months
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_2_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>short of two years ago. I was still working
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_2_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>but I was pregnant. Bought it on time.
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_2_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>Knew I'd need it, what with the kid. And1
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_2_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>have given it a working out, I'll tell you,
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_2_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>not enough to account for it breaking
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_2_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>down so soon, though, don't try that line

			</p>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_3_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>made sure of: I got a guarantee. It was for
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_3_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>one year, renewable for one more year,
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_3_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>with nothing said about how many
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_3_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>washes.
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_3_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>I had a sinking feeling trouble was com
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_3_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>ing when I called that repair company.
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_3_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>First thing, they interrupted my story
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_3_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>with, Did I have a contract. I went, You
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_3_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>kidding? Of course I have a contract. You
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_3_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>think they even bothered to pretend to
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_3_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>look for it? Not on your. Right away they
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_3_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>went, Sorry, we don't have a guarantee
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_3_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>for you on file. I knew there was a reason
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_3_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>I hadn't called. They always try that num
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_3_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>ber. I said, Well, I have a contract. They
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_3_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>said, You got a copy? I said, I'll check my
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_3_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>records and hung up fast to keep from
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_3_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>saying something nasty. You get mean
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_3_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>with the guys on the phone, you're fin
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_3_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>ished, no matter if you got a contract
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_3_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>signed in blood.
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_3_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>Thank God for my mother. I'm going
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_3_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>to say three extra Hail Mary's for her to
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_3_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>night before I got to bed. See, it's because
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_3_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>of my mother that I have records. She was
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_3_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>really a case about records. Records and
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_3_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>washing machines. Those were her two
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_3_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>numbers. I remember one Christmas dad
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_3_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>gave her a washing machine. Mom was
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_3_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>kid-pleased up until she looked inside and
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_3_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>didn't find any guarantee. Her face fell.
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_3_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>Old dad, he got mad. He didn't like how
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_3_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>she went straight for the evidence. I don't
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_3_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>know what he expected. Something ri-
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_3_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>dick. He was always wanting her to put on
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_4_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>a happy-happy act. Never did understand
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_4_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>how she wasn't phony, how she never put
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_4_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>on an act unless she had the goods to back
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_4_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>it up, that was one of the best things about
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_4_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>mom, but old dad couldn't understand
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_4_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>what was good about that. Women were
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_4_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>supposed to be phony, how he saw it.
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_4_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>That was what they were for. To put a
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_4_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>goddamn gloss on life. Which was exactly
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_4_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>what she wouldn't do, not anymore than
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_4_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>she would shut up about the guarantee,
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_4_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>which she needed for her "records."
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_4_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>When old dad didn't come up with it
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_4_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>immediately, she started in saying about
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_4_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>how he must have lost it, or maybe he
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_4_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>bought the machine hot on the street,
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_4_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>didn't he know it wasn't worth the money
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_4_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>you saved if you didn't get a guarantee,
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_4_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>plus having to worry about cops coming
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_4_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>to check the registration. Old dad almost
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_4_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>slammed her into the washing machine
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_4_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>but then he must've remembered how it
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_4_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>was Christmas or else he couldn't resist
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_4_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>proving her wrong for once. Anyway he
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_4_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>pulled the guarantee out of his pocket and
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_4_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>waved it in front of her face. Soon as she
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_4_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>saw it, she quieted down like a hungry
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_4_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>kid's just got a bottle. Thank you, she
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_4_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>said, saint sweet. Then she showed me
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_4_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>how to file the guarantee in her records.
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_4_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>"This guarantee is for five years, honey,
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_4_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>she said. "If I should die before five years
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_4_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>and the washing machine breaks, you
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_4_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>look right in here and get out the guaran

				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_2_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>Martine: Do you find it difficult to use
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_2_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>guns? Because you're a girl? Do you feel
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_2_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>you need a lot of strength to use them?
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_2_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>Vicki: Not really, because since my
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_2_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>brothers were Nomads, which was before
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_2_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>they were Roman Kings, they had guns.
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_2_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>So the first gun that they had lent to me
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_2_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>was a .22. It was small, and my brother,
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_2_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>think it was Ace, told me, "You never
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_2_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>shot a gun, right?" and I told him, "No.
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_2_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>So he told me, "Come with me up to the
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_2_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>roof." He shot and says, "Now is your
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_2_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>turn." I didn't know what the hell to do,
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_2_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>so I said, "What do I do with this?
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_2_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>"Just do straight," he says, and I shot it.
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_2_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>The first time you feel kind of nervous
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_2_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>after you shoot a gun because it kicks a
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_2_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>lot. From that day on, every time I'd get a
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_2_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>gun I'd start shooting on the roof. And
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_2_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>that's how I learned. But a big gun isn't
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_2_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>easy for me to handle.
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_2_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>Martine: Like a .45?
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_2_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>Vicki: A .45 gives you a lot of kick. Like
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_2_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>a rifle. I couldn't handle that.

				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_2_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>you learned?
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_2_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>Vicki: I was small. I was about eleven.
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_2_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>But from that day on I have a .32 auto
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_2_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>matic on me. They're getting it fixed for
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_2_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>me now. I always carry it around, especi-
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_2_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>ally when I get my check . . . or when I'm
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_2_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>coming home alone at night. You know,
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_3_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>somebody is going to jump me and stuff,
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_3_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>so I just pull it out. I won't shoot to kill,
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_3_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>but I'll shoot them so they know not to
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_3_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>fuck around with me no more. That's how
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_3_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>I am. But that time, with that girl, I didn't
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_3_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>want to take up the gun because I feel,
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_3_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>boy, I'll just slap her around a few times
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_3_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>and the girl will shut her damned I
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_3_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>don't like to talk when I argue with some-
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_3_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>body. I'll swing first. I lost my temper fast
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_3_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>... even with a guy (laughs). That's why
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_3_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>most of my boyfriends, they left me. I'm
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_3_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>serious. It's not that I'm a manhandler
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_3_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>but it's the type of thing where I don't like
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_3_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>nobody to slap me around. My mother
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_3_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>don't hit me. My own mother, she hit me
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_3_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>only twice and that was when I was small.
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_3_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>Martine: You think guys leave you for
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_3_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>that. They can't take it?
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_3_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>Vicki: They can't take it because they ar
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_3_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>gued with me—I get mad fast. Especially
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_3_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>when they cuss at you, say, "Ah, fuck
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_3_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>you" or something like that. And I say,
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_3_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>"What?" They don't have to swing at me
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_3_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>first because I’ll turn around and l"Il
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_3_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>swing at them and we just fight right
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_3_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>there. I know you know I’m not as strong
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_3_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>as a man and really they kick my ass, you
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_3_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>might as well say. But I've proved to them
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_3_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>that when you raise a hand on me, I’m
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_3_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>going to raise one back. Because he would
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_3_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>lose respect for me just as much as I am
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_3_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>losing respect for him. We just fall sliding
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_3_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>all over the place until one of us gives up
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_4_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>... and most likely he's going to give up
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_4_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>because I lost my temper and if I grab
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_4_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>their hair, whatever I got, I won't let go.
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_4_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>Martine: You are lucky to have brothers
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_4_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>teaching you how to fight.
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_4_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>Vicki: Yeah. Like when we was the
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_4_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>Young Nomads they used to put me up to
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_4_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>fight with the girls.
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_4_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>Martine: For initiation?
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_4_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>Vicki: Yeah. If I would lose a fight,
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_4_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>they'll make me fight her and fight her
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_4_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>until I win. I could be dead on my feet
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_4_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>and, boy, they tell me to go ahead and
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_4_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>fight, fight until I’m going to get real mad
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_4_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>and I’m going to whip her ass. That's how
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_4_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>they taught me. Don't be scared of no
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_4_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>body. Especially if they raise their hand to
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_4_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>you. So, that's what happened.
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_4_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>Martine: And that's why you want to
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_4_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>teach your little girl to fight?
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_4_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>Vicki: Right. Now she gets real mad. She
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_4_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>starts swinging at anybody that's there,
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_4_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>whoever bothers her. I teach her. I tell
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_4_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>her, "You hit back because they only
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_4_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>going to fuck over you if you don't hit
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_4_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>back. She's like that [laughs). She's like
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_4_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>that and I’m like that. But I don't tell her
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_4_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>go, go around hitting everybody in the
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_4_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>chead ...
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_4_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>just tell her, "When
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_4_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>somebody hits you, you hit back. And if

				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_2_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>back when I sent it in. Did I hold my

				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_2_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>You better believe. When I found it, I
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_2_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>held on tight and called them back. Lis

				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_2_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>contract back in the mail. He said, If you
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_2_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>don't have a contract, what can I do. I
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_2_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>said, Forget that line, I've got my can
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_2_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>celled check. Do you know what he had
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_2_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>the nerve to try to get away with? He said,
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_2_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>If you cancelled the check, it don't prove

				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_2_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>much is it for? he said. I told him thirty
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_2_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>seven dollars. He said, Who is it made out
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_2_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>to. I read him the name of his own com
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_2_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>pany and his bank too, just for good
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_2_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>housekeeping. Sorry lady, he said. Book-
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_2_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>keeper must have slipped up. I’ll send a
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_2_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>man out tomorrow. Like hell she did, I
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_2_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>thought, but I didn't say it. Enough was
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_2_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>said already, the way I saw it.
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_2_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>All the same, I was furious. Doing me
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_2_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>that way was bad enough, those blow
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_2_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>joes, but at least I had records. Listen:

				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_2_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>mother. I bet they even pull that number

				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_2_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>She's got money so she pays the extra fee,
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_2_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>while the women around here they just
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_2_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>end up with a broke machine in their kit
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_2_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>chens. Then they start decorating it up
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_2_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>because what else is it good for and the
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_2_1_tl_45' n='N045'/>social workers come and make fun, those
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_2_1_tl_46' n='N046'/>player pianos, they've only got about two
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_2_1_tl_47' n='N047'/>tunes inside them, and you can't dance to
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_2_1_tl_48' n='N048'/>either one.
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_2_1_tl_49' n='N049'/>Well, wouldn't you know it, sun was
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_2_1_tl_50' n='N050'/>still out today and the snow was all melt-
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_2_1_tl_51' n='N051'/>ed. For the first day in months, I could
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_2_1_tl_52' n='N052'/>take my kid out in his stroller, and I had
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_2_1_tl_53' n='N053'/>to wait inside for the washing machine re
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_2_1_tl_54' n='N054'/>pairman. Then I remembered, some of
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_2_1_tl_55' n='N055'/>those wishywashies made a law that says
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_2_1_tl_56' n='N056'/>the repair places have to tell you if they're
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_2_1_tl_57' n='N057'/>coming morning or afternoon and stick to
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_2_1_tl_58' n='N058'/>what they tell you or else. So I called the
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_2_1_tl_59' n='N059'/>place to find out when the man was com
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_3_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>ing. You called the wrong number, he
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_3_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>grumped the way my husband used to
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_3_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>when he had to work Saturdays. My bad
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_3_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>moods come on later, when the day starts
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_3_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>getting to me, so I apologized and asked
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_3_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>for the right number. The guy got all of a
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_3_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>sudden kind and said he'd go over and
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_3_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>find out what time the man was coming.
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_3_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>When he came back, he said, The repair
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_3_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>man has five calls before you so it'll be
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_3_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>afternoon. So I can stroll my kid this
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_3_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>morning? I said to make sure. You heard
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_3_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>me, he said. Glad I’m not married to you,
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_3_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>I said, and he laughed, gruffy soft, the
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_3_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>way that kind of bear-man can be
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_3_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>sometimes.
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_3_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>Well, I wished that hadn't happened be-
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_3_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>cause all the while I was stuffing my kid
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_3_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>into his bunny snowsuit with the white
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_3_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>tuftballs on the front and behind, I was
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_3_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>feeling that love longing. It's just spring, I
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_3_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>told myself, but it kept on. Listen: I don't
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_3_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>like that feeling. It's landed me in trouble
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_3_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>one time too many. So when the sun had
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_3_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>gone under a gray rippled cloud by the
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_3_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>time I got my kid downstairs and stuck the
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_3_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>bottle in his mouth and the graham crackers
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_3_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>in his fist and rolled on outside, I was
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_3_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>glad. It's a lot easier to stomp out longing
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_3_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>when it's gray out. Hey, I said to my kid,
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_3_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>sky looks like your diapers the way they
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_3_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>come out of the machine nowadays. He

				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_5_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>and he'd just finished making that sau

				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_11_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>Really and truly.
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_11_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>Martine: You think girls fight as much as
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_11_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>guys?
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_11_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>Vicki: Well, guys fight a lot. Girls don't
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_11_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>fight as much. Like if it was all up to them
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_11_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>we’ll fight. The guys, they got to fight be
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_11_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>cause their prez tells them to fight. But if
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_11_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>it was up to us girls, we'd hang-out to
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_11_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>gether. We would like to have a brother

				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_11_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>that girl from school, Nancy. We fought
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_11_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>and then she told the school I pulled out a

			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_1_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>knife on her and they threw me out.
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_1_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>couldn't go to school no more so I had
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_1_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>something against the Immortals because

				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_5_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>Martine: Um-hum.
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_5_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>Vicki: I start messing with her and mess
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_5_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>ing with her until, you know, we rumbled.
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_5_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>When I have something against somebody
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_5_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>I take it out in one fight. One fight. As
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_5_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>long as I get my shit off. After that if she
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_5_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>want to talk to me, she talk to me but she
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_5_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>could go to hell, too. I tell her, "I was
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_5_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>born in this world by myself . . .
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_6_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>Vicki: Yeah, like that girl. I grab her
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_6_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>alone and we straightened it out and now
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_6_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>me an' her don't have no trouble. I see
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_6_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>her. She's in jail right now when I go to
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_6_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>see her.
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_6_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>Martine: Why is she in jail?
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_6_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>Vicki: She was selling drugs. She sold
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_6_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>drugs to a cop and now she's facing ten to
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_6_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>twenty-five.
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_6_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>Martine: Were there many fights with
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_6_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>knives and guns at the time you were in
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_6_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>school?
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_6_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>Vicki: No, just with the hands. No guns
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_6_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>or knives, we just fight with the hands.
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_6_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>Most of the time that there's fights is be
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_6_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>cause someone don't like you or someone
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_6_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>try to take my boyfriend away. So, they
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_6_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>fight and scratch each other up.
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_6_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>Martine: But you've fought with knives
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_6_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>and stuff. Was that outside of school?
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_6_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>Vicki: Yeah, outside. That's right. Put it
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_6_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>this way, if I was to rumble with some-
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_6_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>body, right? Say I wanted to use my hands
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_6_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>but before we fight we don't search each
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_6_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>other. So, let's say I fight somebody and I
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_6_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>beat her up. She ain't going to like that.
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_6_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>So she know if she fights with me again,
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_6_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>I’m going to beat her up again. So she'll
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_6_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>bring something to stab me with or she'll
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_6_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>bring a gun and shoot me with it. We
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_6_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>don't trust them just like they don't trust
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_6_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>Martine: So you think that's one of the
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_6_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>reasons why kids in the clique carry guns?
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_7_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>Vicki: Yeah. That's why. Because we
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_7_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>don't trust them. God knows what they
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_7_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>going to do when we turn our backs, just
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_7_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>like God knows what we going to do when
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_7_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>they turn their backs. That's all.

			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_8_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>Martine: Do you remember when Charlie
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_8_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>organized that big meeting with all the

				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_7_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>to say) so I stopped by a bus waiting place
				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_7_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>where there was a patch of light just big
				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_7_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>enough to warm me and my kid and I sat
				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_7_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>down on the peeling green bench, tore off
				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_7_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>a big hunk of bread for myself and a little
				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_7_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>one for the kid, and we sat there in the sun
				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_7_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>chewing. These little breezes got to me be
				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_7_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>tween the bench slats, you know, and I
				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_7_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>felt these small human chills. If God ever
				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_7_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>asked me what I wanted out of life, I’d tell
				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_7_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>him to feel like a human being all the
				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_7_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>time. He probably wouldn't like that.
				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_7_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>Doesn't seem like a whole lot to ask,
				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_7_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>though, does it? I mean when you think
				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_7_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>of all the things I could ask for. Doesn't
				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_7_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>seem like the kind of wish you get turned
				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_7_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>into a fish for.
				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_7_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>Well, it was getting late, so I started
				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_7_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>back. Noticed my kid was looking behind
				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_7_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>us, so I looked too: The sidewalks were all
				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_7_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>dry, you know, pale dry, and hardly any
				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_7_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>people had walked yet, so you could see
				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_7_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>these clear dark footprints caused by me
				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_7_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>walking in a puddle and then stepping on
				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_7_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>the dry walk and there were stroller tracks
				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_7_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>too and it was like we had had an effect,
				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_7_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>my kid and me, and it was like our path
				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_7_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>behind us and my kid was smiling and so
				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_7_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>was I. We went most of the way home like
				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_7_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>that, going forward but looking back. I
				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_7_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>felt like a kid in the back seat watching the
				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_7_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>road, you know. I wanted to drive then so
				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_7_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>bad. I never did know when I had it good,
				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_7_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>still don't, and I felt that longing again,
				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_7_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>and I wished my husband back so bad,
				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_7_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>lying on top of the white chenille spread,
				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_7_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>in the sunlight, that time of spring when
				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_7_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>the light goes from white to yellow, the
				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_7_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>whole room smelling of the sex that was all
				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_7_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>we did in those days. We never fought. All
				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_7_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>the time we were going out we never
				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_7_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>fought. The slapping didn't start until we
				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_7_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>got married, and then when I got pregnant
				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_7_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>it was all over. He acted like I was a
				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_7_1_tl_45' n='N045'/>punching bag and I told him, Cut it out or
				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_7_1_tl_46' n='N046'/>get out. It was his fault anyway I got preg-
				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_7_1_tl_47' n='N047'/>nant. He wouldn't let me use anything.
				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_7_1_tl_48' n='N048'/>Well, it wasn't his fault entirely. I let him
				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_7_1_tl_49' n='N049'/>be that way. Listen: I loved him better
				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_7_1_tl_50' n='N050'/>than myself. But not better than my kid.
				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_7_1_tl_51' n='N051'/>It was for my kid I told him, Cut it out or
				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_7_1_tl_52' n='N052'/>get out. Listen: You probably think I
				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_7_1_tl_53' n='N053'/>asked for it, the way I've been shooting
				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_7_1_tl_54' n='N054'/>off at the mouth but I didn't. I was too
				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_7_1_tl_55' n='N055'/>scared to talk out in those days. It's only
				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_7_1_tl_56' n='N056'/>since I've been on my own with my kid to
				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_7_1_tl_57' n='N057'/>fend for I've gotten so tough talking. I
				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_7_1_tl_58' n='N058'/>figure, Things can't get any worse. I might
				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_7_1_tl_59' n='N059'/>as well speak my mind.

				<lb facs='#facs_9_r_2_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>extra for waiting. Well, I remembered

				<lb facs='#facs_9_r_3_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>Vicki: I was upstate at the time. I heard
				<lb facs='#facs_9_r_3_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>about it. By the time I got back everything
				<lb facs='#facs_9_r_3_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>passed and everybody was walking the
				<lb facs='#facs_9_r_3_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>streets again. All the cliques.
				<lb facs='#facs_9_r_3_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>Martine: You're a leader of a clique, too.
				<lb facs='#facs_9_r_3_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>Did you ever think about getting all the
				<lb facs='#facs_9_r_3_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>cliques together?
				<lb facs='#facs_9_r_3_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>Vicki: Yeah. I tried to do that a lot. I
				<lb facs='#facs_9_r_3_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>would talk to my girls and tell them we
				<lb facs='#facs_9_r_3_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>should get all the cliques and the girl
				<lb facs='#facs_9_r_3_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>together. You know, make truce and then
				<lb facs='#facs_9_r_3_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>throw parties. It would be nice having all

				<lb facs='#facs_9_r_4_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>the girls coming down to a party and shit.
				<lb facs='#facs_9_r_4_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>But it could never happen that way. Be
				<lb facs='#facs_9_r_4_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>cause of the guys ..
				<lb facs='#facs_9_r_4_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>Martine: You know, Vicki, you were tell-
				<lb facs='#facs_9_r_4_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>ing me about the Outlaw Marriages in the
				<lb facs='#facs_9_r_4_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>cliques. You told me that the girl who gets
				<lb facs='#facs_9_r_4_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>married in certain cliques has to get down
				<lb facs='#facs_9_r_4_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>with all the guys in the clique. Do you feel
				<lb facs='#facs_9_r_4_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>that the girls feel like that is like being
				<lb facs='#facs_9_r_4_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>raped?
				<lb facs='#facs_9_r_4_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>Vicki: I feel that they do, yeah. It's just
				<lb facs='#facs_9_r_4_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>like rape. When a girl has to get down
				<lb facs='#facs_9_r_4_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>with all of them. I wouldn't do that. I
				<lb facs='#facs_9_r_4_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>couldn't walk in the street proud. They

				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_2_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>think women know anything. He started
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_2_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>right in fiddling with it, ignoring me com
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_2_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>pletely. Well, that got my goat. I am a
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_2_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>specialist in what's wrong with that ma-
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_2_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>chine. I've got two years' experience. I
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_2_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>said, Don't you want to know what's
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_2_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>wrong with it? (You big lunk, I almost
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_2_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>added; tell the truth, he reminded me so
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_2_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>much of my ex, it was all I could do to
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_2_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>keep myself from talking to him that same
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_2_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>old way; might've in fact, except I didn't
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_2_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>want him slapping me across the room
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_2_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>bad enough when your own husband does
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_2_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>it, let alone a stranger.) What's wrong
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_2_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>with it? he said, real sarcastic. I told him
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_2_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>best I could about how it goes on different
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_2_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>cycles than the dial says and it jerks
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_2_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>around the wash so much acts like it wants
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_2_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>to kill it instead of just clean it and when it
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_2_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>goes on dry spin it bangs around some
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_2_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>thing awful. Unplugged itself last week.
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_2_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>(A lot like my marriage, that machine. A
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_2_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>lot like everything in my life, that ma
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_2_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>chine. Good thing I’m not superstitious.)
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_2_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>You finished? he said. I nodded. He op
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_2_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>ened the machine. Half my last week's
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_2_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>wash was still in there stinking. I didn't
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_2_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>know what else to do with it. You got this
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_2_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>wash in wrong, he said. It wasn't like that
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_2_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>before, I said. I wanted to leave the scene
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_2_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>of the crime exactly as it was, but my kid
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_2_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>had to have some clean clothes so I've
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_2_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>been taking stuff out piece by piece, rins
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_2_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>ing them myself and drying them on the
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_2_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>radiators. The clothes were even before.
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_2_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>Honest. You got this wash in wrong, he
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_2_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>said again in exactly the same tone. I got
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_2_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>it, I thought. You're that kind of man
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_2_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>can't even hear a woman talking. So I
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_2_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>shut my mouth and backed up.
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_2_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>Next thing I know he's throwing wet
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_2_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>stinking clothes at my belly. Thanks a lot,
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_2_1_tl_45' n='N045'/>I say, catching some socks and gray dia
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_2_1_tl_46' n='N046'/>pers. He doesn't do all the clothes like
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_2_1_tl_47' n='N047'/>that, just enough to get me wet, then he
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_2_1_tl_48' n='N048'/>hooks the washer to the sink and starts
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_2_1_tl_49' n='N049'/>turning it off and on. Next he whips a
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_2_1_tl_50' n='N050'/>kitchen knife out of his tool belt and uses
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_2_1_tl_51' n='N051'/>it to press some button that isn't in the in
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_2_1_tl_52' n='N052'/>structions and it lets water out. Then he
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_2_1_tl_53' n='N053'/>takes the dial off, then he lets some more
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_2_1_tl_54' n='N054'/>water out with the kitchen knife, then he
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_2_1_tl_55' n='N055'/>puts the dial back on and says it's all right.
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_2_1_tl_56' n='N056'/>Yeah? I said. Show me. He puts it on spin
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_2_1_tl_57' n='N057'/>and water starts going in. It's not all right,
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_2_1_tl_58' n='N058'/>I say. Water's supposed to be going out
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_2_1_tl_59' n='N059'/>not in. This machine's mixed up. So he
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_3_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>opens the top of the washer, not the top
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_3_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>that usually opens but the whole top, and
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_3_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>he fiddles with something, I don't know
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_3_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>what, I’m too horrified by how dirty the
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_3_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>machine is outside and I’m grabbing for
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_3_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>my sponge and starting to clean. That's
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_3_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>the only time he looks nice at me the
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_3_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>whole visit. Then he spins the dial again
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_3_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>and takes it off and puts it on again and
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_3_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>sets it on rinse and pushes with his knife
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_3_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>and lets out the water and then he says it
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_3_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>again: It's all right. You're going to have
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_3_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>to show me, I said. He's not happy but he
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_3_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>puts it on spin and it makes a peculiar
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_3_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>noise but it spins all right and hardly any
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_3_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>new water goes in but some does and
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_3_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>say, More water is going in and he makes
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_3_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>up some cock and bull story about how
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_3_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>that always happens and I make him run it
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_3_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>all the way through spin and it gets to the
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_3_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>end and in this real ass-in-your-nose fash
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_3_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>ion, he says, Satisfied? Well, I’m not and
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_3_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>I say, We'll see how it works in real life.
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_3_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>He says, Yeah? It doesn't work in real
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_3_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>life, you're in real trouble. I say, What're
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_3_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>you talking about? He says, I’ll tell you
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_3_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>what went wrong here. I say, So tell me
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_3_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>He says, You took this dial off and put it
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_3_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>back on wrong. I said, I didn't take no
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_3_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>dial off. He said, He took this dial off and
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_3_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>when he put it back on wrong that was the
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_3_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>problem. I said, He? Who's . . . and then
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_3_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>I remembered I couldn't say I didn't have
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_3_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>a husband because I already said I did
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_3_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>have one so I changed it to, My husband's
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_3_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>always out with his shit girlfriends, fat

				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_6_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>everybody flies their colors. We're clean.

			<p>

				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_4_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>best man. They was in back of us and then
				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_4_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>we walked down the aisle. You might as
				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_4_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>well say the aisle. We walked down there.
				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_4_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>Like in a church. The guy that married us
				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_4_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>was Husky Pekiching. So we walked up to
				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_4_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>him. We stand there because it was like a
				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_4_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>double wedding. And Husky was there
				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_4_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>telling us, "I now pronounce you man
				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_4_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>and wife," like all the things that they say

				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_4_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>Martine: What kind of book?
				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_4_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>Vicki: Let me see. It was a Bible. He was
				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_4_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>holding in his hands. We even had rings
				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_4_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>You know, I’m no saying expensive wed-
				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_4_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>ding rings but they was real Sterling. Any
				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_4_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>way he say, "Kiss your bride and put the
				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_4_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>ring on the finger," and it was just like a
				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_4_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>real church. Except that afterwards, in
				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_4_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>stead of throwing rice like they do in
				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_4_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>church, they're pouring beer all over us.
				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_4_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>While we're walking down the aisle. Three
				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_4_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>quarts.
				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_4_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>Martine: Did you sing?

				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_4_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>beer and they get us real high and then
				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_4_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>we're allowed to stay in the club. The club
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_5_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>was our apartment for three days. It's in
				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_5_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>this wrecked building. It was our honey
				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_5_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>moon. We stayed there for three days . .
				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_5_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>without coming out [laughs). If the Ro
				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_5_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>man Kings would have seen us out before
				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_5_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>three days they would have sent us back
				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_5_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>in. Yeah.
				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_5_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>Martine: The two couples?
				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_5_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>Vicki: Huh?
				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_5_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>Martine: You were four people having a
				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_5_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>honeymoon in that apartment?
				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_5_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>Vicki: Yeah. There was two rooms, yeah
				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_5_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>[laughs). There was two rooms. And we
				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_5_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>have fun [laughs).
				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_5_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>Martine: Did you cook?
				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_5_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>Vicki: Yeah.
				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_5_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>Martine: And love?
				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_5_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>Vicki: Yeah (laughs).
				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_5_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>Martine: And care for each other?
				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_5_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>Vicki: Yep. And from that day on, this
				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_5_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>happened four months ago, we're still
				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_5_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>together.
				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_5_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>Martine: And where was your little girl?
				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_5_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>Vicki: Huh? My little girl? My mother
				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_5_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>was with her. I told me mother about it.
				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_5_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>She didn't say nothing. My mother would
				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_5_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>take care of her and take her outside.
				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_5_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>Martine: Did your mother come to your
				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_5_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>wedding?
				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_5_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>Vicki: Arę you crazy?
				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_5_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>Martine: There were no parents?
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_6_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>Vicki: No, just us. But I feel it was nice,
				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_6_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>you know, because l've been raised by
				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_6_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>gangs. So to me it was nice. It was very
				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_6_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>nice . .
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_7_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>Martine: You were telling me about your
				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_7_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>sister who got raped in your building.
				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_7_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>What happened?
				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_7_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>Vicki: Well, she was going to school and
				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_7_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>she forgot her wallet. She came back up
				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_7_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>and this guy was in the elevator with her.
				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_7_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>They're friends so they was talking to
				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_7_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>each other. When they got to his floor he
				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_7_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>pushed her out and then he raped her right
				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_7_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>there. She stayed in her room after that.
				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_7_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>She didn't want to talk to nobody. She
				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_7_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>didn't want to tell nobody until long after
				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_7_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>She told me. I told my mother. And till
				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_7_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>this day he still lives in the building. My
				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_7_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>sister, she always remember that. Right
				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_7_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>now she's living with her husband and
				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_7_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>when she has sexual, you know, inter
				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_7_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>course with him she thinks of that and
				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_7_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>that fucks her up. But at least she told
				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_7_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>him. She told him what happened to hei
				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_7_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>and he don't blame her. He knows what's
				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_7_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>happening. Some guys sooner or later ges
				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_7_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>rough with you when that's happened but
				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_7_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>he takes care of her. He knows what she
				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_7_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>went through. Now they're all right. The
				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_7_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>rest of the rapes ain't around here
				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_7_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>They're a few blocks down ... on Fox
				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_7_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>Street. I never heard of none around here.
				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_7_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>Martine: There are a lot of abandoned

				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_2_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>he makes me sign a receipt and then he

				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_2_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>report. Well, I got furious. He was head

				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_2_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>man report. Fat chance. Well, l'm writing
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_2_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>in my report, I said, that's going to the

				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_2_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>you came in here and were rude to me and

				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_2_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>and start making up the letter in my mind
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_2_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>and all the people l'm going to carbon
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_2_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>in and then I remember I don't have his

				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_2_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>and I say, Yes, you do, you work for a

				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_2_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>you do have to tell me your name. He kepi

				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_2_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>killed that jerk, I mean it. And I yelled,
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_2_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>TELL ME YOUR NAME. He looked
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_2_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>around to see if anyone on the street was

				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_2_1_tl_52' n='N052'/>lost it thanks to that song, but I got it
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_2_1_tl_53' n='N053'/>back and remembered his last name was
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_2_1_tl_54' n='N054'/>on the receipt so I said, Give me the

				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_2_1_tl_57' n='N057'/>Give me my receipt. And he pulled the re

				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_4_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>he punched at that doorbell but he didn't,
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_4_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>he let go of it, and he got in his truck and
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_4_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>drove off and I watched him and all the
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_4_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>time I clutched the receipt in my hand and
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_4_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>when he was gone, I looked at it, and it
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_4_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>was pink, baby girl pink.
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_4_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>But I won you know, anyway, I won.

				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_4_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>to think about him going home at five
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_4_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>o'clock and hitting his wife because may
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_4_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>be she cooked something he doesn't like
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_4_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>and then after he's had some beers and
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_4_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>cooled off he'll go upstairs where she's
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_4_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>lying in bed feeling sorry for herself,
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_4_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>watching TV, and he'll say he's sorry,
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_4_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>honey, and see he had this bad day, some
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_4_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>crazy woman tried to cheat his company
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_4_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>and was yelling at him in the street, and
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_4_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>she'll pat his shoulder and say, It's all
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_4_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>right, snooks, she knows how he feels, he
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_4_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>works so hard for her and the kids, and he
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_4_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>shouldn't take so much to heart. To
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_4_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>heart! As if he had a heart. And then I
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_4_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>guess they'll "make love," what a joke,
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_4_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>and l'Il go to sleep. I wonder who'll have
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_4_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>worse dreams, her, or him? Not me, that's

				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_4_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>me a frame for that pink slip, and if any
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_4_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>body asks me why it's hanging on my bed

				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_4_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>adultery so she can throw me off ADC,
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_4_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>l'm going to tell her it's a symbol of my

				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_4_1_tl_46' n='N046'/>don't care if she does throw me off either.
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_4_1_tl_47' n='N047'/>My kid's almost old enough to go to day

				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_6_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>that just get put up and then I seen them
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_6_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>get knocked down. I seen this place we
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_6_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>live in when it was pretty. Yeah, pretty.
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_6_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>When there was nice pretty buildings all
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_6_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>over and now that l'm older they're not
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_6_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>pretty anymore. When it was first built it
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_6_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>was nice. Locks on the door in the front
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_6_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>of the building and everything. But now
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_6_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>it's all knocked down. I remember when
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_6_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>that store [down the street) was built.
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_6_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>They knocked it down. They ain't nothing
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_6_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>there no more. There was a movie house
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_6_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>up here. Right up the block but it burned
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_6_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>down. It ain't a movie no more. People
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_6_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>that are very close to me moved away be
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_6_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>cause of the neighborhood and things like
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_6_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>that. But you got to live through it be
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_6_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>cause everywhere you go people are going
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_6_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>to move away. There's going to be trouble
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_6_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>no matter. where you are. Trouble always
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_6_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>follows. Like I got a friend that died. She
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_6_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>was close to me. Her name was Edna. She
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_6_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>was going out with my brother and she
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_6_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>ran away with him for a while. Her moth-
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_6_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>er brang her back home and she was
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_6_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>working. As a matter of fact she was
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_6_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>working down Kelly Street where she
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_6_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>died. They shot her four times in the back
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_6_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>and she's dead.

				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_3_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>Vicki: We don't know who shot her.
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_3_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>They said she look like another girl that
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_3_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>they had a contract out on and they shot
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_3_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>her four times in the back with a .38. She
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_3_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>was in a different gang but she was close
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_3_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>to me. Very close to me. When she died I
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_3_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>felt it for a long time. I wouldn't be as
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_3_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>happy as I was. I wouldn't talk a lot. P'o
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_3_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>just stay to myself and sit alone. I felt like
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_3_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>I lost one of my family when she died. I
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_3_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>went to her funeral. I used to go down
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_3_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>there to New Jersey and look at the grave
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_3_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>Now there's nothing. Just her name. But
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_3_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>she was only fourteen when she died
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_3_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>Fourteen. Every time four days before my
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_3_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>birthday I think about her. I just get real
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_3_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>high and drunk. I try to forget about it be
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_3_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>cause if I keep on thinking about it il
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_3_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>would be worse for me. That girl. I
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_3_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>never forget. They thought she was an
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_3_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>other girl. They shot her because they
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_3_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>thought she was the other girl. They shot
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_3_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>her. We still don't know who it was ..

				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_4_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>Martine: Do you think of moving out
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_4_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>when you get older?
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_4_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>Vicki: Sometime. But in a way I can't

				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_4_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>to one place and if I go to another l'm not
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_4_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>going to get used to it. I love this place no
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_4_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>matter how fucked up it looks. I was born
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_4_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>here and raised here and I guess l'm going
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_4_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>to stay here. Ain't nobody and no one
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_4_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>going to stop me from doing what I want
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_4_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>to do. If your mind is set up to do some

				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_4_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>going to become something or if l'm go
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_4_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>ing to get fucked up I don't have to go out
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_4_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>of state to do it. This is the South Bronx

				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_5_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>I am frightened by large men—muscles,
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_5_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>or possibly it is fat, the men who
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_5_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>make noises at women to prove that
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_5_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>they are men.
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_5_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>I am frightened by these seemingly
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_5_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>strong hunks—but whose strength is
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_5_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>spent at proving themselves thru
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_5_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>Women.
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_5_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>I am frightened of these men in
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_5_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>reality and abstract alike.
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_5_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>It frightens me: their size, their hatred,
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_5_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>their lack of love or passion, their
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_5_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>absence of spirit.
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_5_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>But . . . then I realize, the substance
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_5_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>or glue that holds them together, that
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_5_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>is responsible for their looming presence
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_5_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>in my mind—is my fear.
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_5_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>They are really no more than hollow
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_5_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>shapes—kept intact and in the dark
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_5_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>shadows I see at night—by women's

				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_5_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>That is how they reproduce
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_5_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>themselves
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_5_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>making women frightened. That is their

				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_5_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>Doctored by fear. Nursed by women's
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_5_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>fear of men.
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_5_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>Women's silent scream of terror

				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_5_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>Women, by overcoming their fears, will
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_5_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>take the glue (that holds these men
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_5_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>together) away.
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_5_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>far far far far away.
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_5_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>And yet ... l'm still frightened
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_5_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>even though I think I understand.
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_5_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>Give me the strength to become

				<lb facs='#facs_20_r_3_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>(Brown, 1952). The severity of punish-

				<lb facs='#facs_20_r_3_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>compensation. We would need the full

				<lb facs='#facs_20_r_3_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>between the type of punishment and the

				<lb facs='#facs_20_r_3_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>Yet rape occurs in many societies where
				<lb facs='#facs_20_r_3_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>it is not considered a crime; in fact, it is
				<lb facs='#facs_20_r_3_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>institutionalized and culturally valued.
				<lb facs='#facs_20_r_3_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>This category of rape may be the more

				<lb facs='#facs_20_r_3_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>rape is rigorously studied, a mature typol

				<lb facs='#facs_20_r_3_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>select two types which contain analytically
				<lb facs='#facs_20_r_3_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>important elements: (1) symbolic or ritual
				<lb facs='#facs_20_r_3_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>rape, and (2) punitive rape. Although
				<lb facs='#facs_20_r_3_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>these elements refer to how and when rape
				<lb facs='#facs_20_r_3_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>is used, the elements often blend. Thus,
				<lb facs='#facs_20_r_3_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>when rape is associated with ritual, it may
				<lb facs='#facs_20_r_3_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>also be sending a punitive message, and
				<lb facs='#facs_20_r_3_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>when rape is used as punishment there is a

				<lb facs='#facs_23_r_4_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>to reject these initial pieces on the grounds

				<lb facs='#facs_23_r_4_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>about the experience. I knew all those

				<lb facs='#facs_23_r_4_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>the car. The consciousness of racism was a
				<lb facs='#facs_23_r_4_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>factor in my paralysis as a female. The

				<lb facs='#facs_23_r_4_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>ment was the experience of white women

				<lb facs='#facs_23_r_4_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>them in a double bind. They were called

				<lb facs='#facs_23_r_4_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>men, and they were called racist if they

				<lb facs='#facs_29_r_5_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>Down near the edge of the lake there was

				<lb facs='#facs_29_r_5_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>trees. Bradley said, "Let's sit by the
				<lb facs='#facs_29_r_5_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>water, let's sit in the sand," but Katie's
				<lb facs='#facs_29_r_5_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>father said it wasn't sand it was mud
				<lb facs='#facs_29_r_5_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>which was okay for pigs like Bradley, but
				<lb facs='#facs_29_r_5_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>people would rather sit on the grass. Katie

				<lb facs='#facs_29_r_5_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>the grass better too." She was carrying the

				<lb facs='#facs_29_r_5_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>lunch and her father was carrying the
				<lb facs='#facs_29_r_5_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>blanket. "Who asked you," her father
				<lb facs='#facs_29_r_5_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>said.
				<lb facs='#facs_29_r_5_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>Her mother wanted to put the blanket
				<lb facs='#facs_29_r_5_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>down under a tree but her father said he
				<lb facs='#facs_29_r_5_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>hadn't come up to the lake to sit in the
				<lb facs='#facs_29_r_5_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>shade. He had come up to get a suntan, he
				<lb facs='#facs_29_r_5_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>said. He set the blanket down in the mid

				<lb facs='#facs_29_r_5_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>was sitting with her little girl eating hard
				<lb facs='#facs_29_r_5_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>boiled eggs and Ritz crackers. The sun

				<lb facs='#facs_29_r_5_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>and the sky were so bright that Katie had
				<lb facs='#facs_29_r_5_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>to squint her eyes.
				<lb facs='#facs_29_r_5_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>Her mother put down the shopping bag
				<lb facs='#facs_29_r_5_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>that had the lunch in it and she and

				<lb facs='#facs_29_r_5_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>Katie put the towels down next to the
				<lb facs='#facs_29_r_5_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>shopping bag and took off her shorts and
				<lb facs='#facs_29_r_5_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>her shirt. They were all wearing their bath
				<lb facs='#facs_29_r_5_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>ing suits under their clothes. Bradley anc
				<lb facs='#facs_29_r_5_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>Tom were wearing cut-off old trousers of
				<lb facs='#facs_29_r_5_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>Bradley's but Katie had a real bathing
				<lb facs='#facs_29_r_5_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>suit, a blue one-piece one, and not under
				<lb facs='#facs_29_r_5_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>wear like last year.
				<lb facs='#facs_29_r_5_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>Bradley asked if they could go in the
				<lb facs='#facs_29_r_5_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>water, but Katie's father said they could
				<lb facs='#facs_29_r_5_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>wait until he was ready to take them in
				<lb facs='#facs_29_r_5_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>Her father lay down on the blanket anc
				<lb facs='#facs_29_r_5_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>put his arms under his head and it looked
				<lb facs='#facs_29_r_5_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>to Katie as if he was going to lie that way
				<lb facs='#facs_29_r_5_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>for a long time. Then Bradley said,
				<lb facs='#facs_29_r_5_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>"Please can't we go in, please can't we go
				<lb facs='#facs_29_r_5_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>in," and Katie held her breath and wished
				<lb facs='#facs_29_r_5_1_tl_45' n='N045'/>he wouldn't do that. She wanted to go in
				<lb facs='#facs_29_r_5_1_tl_46' n='N046'/>too, she was sweaty and the lake was so
				<lb facs='#facs_29_r_5_1_tl_47' n='N047'/>blue, but she knew that begging would
				<lb facs='#facs_29_r_5_1_tl_48' n='N048'/>just get her father mad.
				<lb facs='#facs_29_r_5_1_tl_49' n='N049'/>But Bradley kept begging. "Why can't
				<lb facs='#facs_29_r_5_1_tl_50' n='N050'/>we go in alone?" he whined. "We went in
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_29_r_7_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>alone last year." That was true, Katie
				<lb facs='#facs_29_r_7_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>knew. She had gone in alone last year and
				<lb facs='#facs_29_r_7_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>the boys had gone in alone too, just at the
				<lb facs='#facs_29_r_7_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>edge. Then her father said he was starting
				<lb facs='#facs_29_r_7_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>to think that maybe Bradley shouldn't go
				<lb facs='#facs_29_r_7_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>in the water at all for the whole day. Then
				<lb facs='#facs_29_r_7_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>finally Bradley knew enough to shut up
				<lb facs='#facs_29_r_7_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>and he asked if he and Tom could go play
				<lb facs='#facs_29_r_7_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>in the sand. Her father said that was just
				<lb facs='#facs_29_r_7_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>the place for two pigs like them.
				<lb facs='#facs_29_r_7_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>Then Bradley and Tom went down to
				<lb facs='#facs_29_r_7_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>where the sand was and Tom's shorts that
				<lb facs='#facs_29_r_7_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>were really Bradley's old trousers were so
				<lb facs='#facs_29_r_7_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>big for him that they hung down to his
				<lb facs='#facs_29_r_7_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>knees and his behind almost showed. Her
				<lb facs='#facs_29_r_7_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>father was lying on his back and he
				<lb facs='#facs_29_r_7_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>watched them go, squinting, without pick
				<lb facs='#facs_29_r_7_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>ing up his head. He said to Katie's mother,
				<lb facs='#facs_29_r_7_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>"Will you look at that one?" meaning
				<lb facs='#facs_29_r_7_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>Tom. Her mother laughed, like she really
				<lb facs='#facs_29_r_7_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>thought Tom looked cute with his pants
				<lb facs='#facs_29_r_7_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>hanging down. Then her father said,
				<lb facs='#facs_29_r_7_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>"Boy you really dressed him up good.
				<lb facs='#facs_29_r_7_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>He's a real beauty." Then her mother
				<lb facs='#facs_29_r_7_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>stopped laughing and said that none of
				<lb facs='#facs_29_r_7_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>Tom's trousers were worn out and she
				<lb facs='#facs_29_r_7_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>didn't see the point in cutting the legs off
				<lb facs='#facs_29_r_7_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>a perfectly good pair. Her father said,
				<lb facs='#facs_29_r_7_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>"He's a real beauty. You dressed him up
				<lb facs='#facs_29_r_7_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>real good," and shut his eyes.
				<lb facs='#facs_29_r_7_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>Then her mother lay down on the blan
				<lb facs='#facs_29_r_7_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>ket too and closed her eyes. Katie sat on
				<lb facs='#facs_29_r_7_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>the grass and watched them. She hoped
				<lb facs='#facs_29_r_7_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>they would be ablè to go in the water
				<lb facs='#facs_29_r_7_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>soon. She saw the sweat on her father's
				<lb facs='#facs_29_r_7_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>forehead and she knew that if it hadn't
				<lb facs='#facs_29_r_7_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>been for Bradley's begging they would
				<lb facs='#facs_29_r_7_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>have been in the water that minute.
				<lb facs='#facs_29_r_7_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>Her mother and father lay there in the

				<lb facs='#facs_29_r_7_1_tl_47' n='N047'/>There were people running into the

				<lb facs='#facs_30_r_2_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>ization which considers violence against

				<lb facs='#facs_30_r_2_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>In many parts of rural Africa a girl's value
				<lb facs='#facs_30_r_2_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>is still measured by the bride price paid to
				<lb facs='#facs_30_r_2_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>her father. Women are thus compelled by

				<lb facs='#facs_30_r_2_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>Without such an operation a girl's

				<lb facs='#facs_30_r_2_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>to serve her husband (who often has many

				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_1_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>at puberty. The male operation, according

				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_1_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>medically condemned.
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_1_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>Three kinds of operations are cited in
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_1_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>medical literature:
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_1_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>1. Sunna Circumcision: This involves
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_1_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>removal of the prepuce and tip of the
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_1_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>clitoris; it can only be done by a skilled
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_1_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>surgeon.
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_1_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>2. Excision and Clitoridectomy: This is the
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_1_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>operation most frequently done; it
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_1_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>entails cutting away (excision) of the
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_1_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>clitoris, labia minora and sometimes all
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_1_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>external genitalia. Razor blades, knives
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_1_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>or glass splinters are used.
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_1_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>3. Infibulation or Pharaonic Circumcision:
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_1_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>After the girl is excised her labia are
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_1_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>scraped and then fastened together with
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_1_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>thorns or catgut. Her legs are then tied
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_1_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>up until the wound has healed. This
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_1_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>operation is usually performed on girls
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_1_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>between four and eight. The purpose is
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_1_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>to close the girl's introitus so that she can
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_1_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>be guaranteed "intact" when given to a
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_1_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>man in marriage. Infibulation is prac
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_1_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>ticed mainly by Moslems, who consider
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_1_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>virginity all-important and demand
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_1_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>visible proof of a "closed" bride.
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_1_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>For all practical purposes, however, one
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_1_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>can speak of only two operations—exci-
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_1_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>sion and infibulation. The crude tools
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_1_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>used by the operators, mainly old women,
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_1_1_tl_45' n='N045'/>preclude the removal of a tiny skinfold
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_1_1_tl_46' n='N046'/>(sunna circumcision).
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_1_1_tl_47' n='N047'/>Excision/clitoridectomy is practiced in
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_1_1_tl_48' n='N048'/>a broad area stretching from Egypt, Ethi
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_1_1_tl_49' n='N049'/>opia, the Red Sea Coast, Kenya and Tan

				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_1_1_tl_53' n='N053'/>ulation is practiced in the Moslem areas of
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_1_1_tl_54' n='N054'/>Africa. In Somalia all girls without ex
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_1_1_tl_55' n='N055'/>ception are infibulated. In Sudan (except
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_1_1_tl_56' n='N056'/>the South), Eritrea (part of Ethiopia),
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_1_1_tl_57' n='N057'/>Northern Kenya and Mali, most girls are
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_1_1_tl_58' n='N058'/>infibulated. In Upper Volta, infibulation
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_1_1_tl_59' n='N059'/>is not practiced; however, the result of
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_1_1_tl_60' n='N060'/>excision is often the same—the wound
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_1_1_tl_61' n='N061'/>created by excision sometimes adheres
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_1_1_tl_62' n='N062'/>and closes the introitus. I saw a woman in

				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_4_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>Her own mother wasn't fat at all. She
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_4_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>looked really pretty, Katie thought, in her
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_4_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>two-piece yellow bathing suit. She had the
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_4_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>prettiest mother of all her friends. She
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_4_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>wasn't fat and her hair was long and red
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_4_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>dish brown and her skin was the whitest
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_4_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>skin could be, like milk, like snow, like a
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_4_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>cloud. Tom had white skin like that but
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_4_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>Katie and Bradley were dark like her fath-
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_4_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>er. Katie wished her skin was white and
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_4_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>that she had a two-piece bathing suit. She
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_4_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>could see her mother's stomach all wet
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_4_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>with sweat and she knew her mother was
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_4_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>waiting for her father to say, Let's go in
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_4_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>the water.
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_4_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>Finally he said it. He said, "It"s time for
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_4_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>a swim." Katie's mother got up and Katie
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_4_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>jumped up and they walked across the
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_4_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>grass to the sand. Bradley and Tom saw
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_4_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>them coming and raced over and said,
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_4_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>"We're going in now, Daddy? We're go-
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_4_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>ing in now?
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_4_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>Her father didn't answer them. He just
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_4_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>walked straight down to the water and
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_4_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>walked in a little way and then dove
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_4_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>under. For a minute they couldn't see
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_4_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>him. Then they saw him come up way out
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_4_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>on the lake near the rope.
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_4_1_tl_45' n='N045'/>Bradley and Tom were flopping on
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_4_1_tl_46' n='N046'/>their bellies and splashing and Katie's
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_4_1_tl_47' n='N047'/>mother told them not to be wild in the
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_4_1_tl_48' n='N048'/>water and not to splash. Katie and her
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_4_1_tl_49' n='N049'/>mother were standing in the shallow
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_4_1_tl_50' n='N050'/>water. Her mother was in up to her ankles
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_7_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>and Katie was in up to her knees. She
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_7_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>couldn't go in any more because the water
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_7_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>was so cold. She felt like she was standing
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_7_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>in a bucket of ice. Every couple of min
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_7_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>utes she walked in a little more and let the
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_7_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>icy water creep up her body. Her mother
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_7_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>wasn't going in any more. She was stand
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_7_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>ing and hugging herself with her arms,
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_7_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>watching the boys to be sure they didn't
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_7_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>drown themselves, smiling at the way they
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_7_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>were squealing and flopping on their bel
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_7_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>lies. Then Bradley started kicking up
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_7_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>water with his feet and he splashed some
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_7_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>on Katie's stomach. She yelled, "Mom,
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_7_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>Bradley's splashing me, and her mother
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_7_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>told Bradley to stop kicking the water.
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_7_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>Katie saw her father swimming toward
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_7_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>them from the rope. When he got to
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_7_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>where they were, he pushed back his hair
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_7_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>which was all wet and blew his nose into
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_7_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>his fingers and said to her mother, "Are
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_7_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>you planning to stand there all day?
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_7_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>Her mother said, "It's so cold, Brad."
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_7_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>Her father said, "Sure it's cold if you just
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_7_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>stand there. Once you get in you get used
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_7_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>to it. Then quick before anyone saw
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_7_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>what he was doing, he scooped up some
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_7_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>water and splashed it on her mother. Her
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_7_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>mother yelled, "Oh no, and sounded so
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_7_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>funny that Katie and the boys laughed.
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_7_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>Then her father said, "C'mon, you got to
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_7_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>get wet" and he splashed her again and
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_7_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>she said, "Oh Brad, don't. Then her
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_7_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>father said she better come on in or he was
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_7_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>going to dunk her good. So she walked
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_7_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>deeper into the water, hugging herself and
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_7_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>saying "Brrr." When she got in up to her
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_7_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>stomach she ducked down fast so that she
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_7_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>was wet all over. Then she swam out a
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_7_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>little and swam back again. "Oh it's freez
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_7_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>ing, she said, "but you get used to it.
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_7_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>Her father said, "That's what I told
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_7_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>you. Then he said to Katie, "C'mon,
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_7_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>you too, get yourself wet.
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_7_1_tl_45' n='N045'/>Katie didn't want to be splashed so she
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_7_1_tl_46' n='N046'/>made herself duck dowa fast in the water
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_7_1_tl_47' n='N047'/>up to her neck. It was so cold it took her
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_7_1_tl_48' n='N048'/>breath away, but it felt good too, she
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_7_1_tl_49' n='N049'/>thought, freezing and tingling all over her

				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_2_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>bors and friends. The father stays outside the
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_2_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>door as a symbolic guard. The mother
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_2_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>officiates, or her place is taken by an older
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_2_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>woman. At each ceremony only one little girl i

				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_2_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>undergo this operation before they are
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_2_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>married.
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_2_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>The ritual itself is not accompanied by
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_2_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>religious ceremony or medicinal prepara
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_2_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>tions—its performance is similar to the castrat
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_2_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>ing of an animal.
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_2_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>The child is made to sit on a stool that is not
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_2_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>even wiped and several women hold her down
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_2_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>firmly. After separating her outer and inner
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_2_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>lips (labia majora and labia minora) with her
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_2_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>fingers, the old woman attaches them with
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_2_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>large thorns onto the flesh of each thigh. With
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_2_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>her kitchen knife the woman then pierces and
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_2_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>slices open the hood of the clitoris and begins
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_2_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>to cut it out. While another woman wipes off
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_2_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>the blood with a rag, the mother (or operator)
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_3_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>digs with her fingernail a hole the length of the
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_3_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>clitoris to detach and pull out that organ. The
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_3_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>little girl screams in extreme pain, but no one
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_3_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>pays the slightest attention.
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_3_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>The woman finishes this job by pulling out
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_3_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>the clitoris entirely; she then cuts it to the bone
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_3_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>with the kitchen knife. Her helpers again wipe
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_3_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>off the spurting blood with a rag. The mother
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_3_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>then lifts up the skin that is left with her thumb
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_3_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>and index finger to remove the remaining flesh
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_3_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>She then digs a deep hole with her hand amidst
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_3_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>the gushing blood. The neighbor women are
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_3_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>invited to take part in the operation; they
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_3_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>plunge their fingers into the bloody hole to
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_3_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>verify that every remnant of the clitoris is
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_3_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>removed.
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_3_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>This operation is not always well managed as
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_3_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>the little girl struggles. Often, by the clumsy use
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_3_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>of the knife or a poorly executed cut, the
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_3_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>bladder is pierced or the rectum is cut open. If
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_3_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>the little girl faints the woman blows pili-pili
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_3_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>(spice powder) into her nostrils to reanimate
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_3_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>But this is not the end of the torture. The
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_3_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>most important phase of the ritual begins only
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_3_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>now. After a short moment the woman takes
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_3_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>the knife again and cuts off the inner lips (labia
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_3_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>minora). The helper again wipes the blood with
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_3_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>her rag. Then the woman with a swift motion
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_3_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>begins to scrape off the skin from the inside of
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_3_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>the large lips.
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_3_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>The operator conscientiously scrapes the
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_3_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>flesh of the screaming child without the
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_3_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>slightest concern for the extreme pain she
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_3_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>inflicts. When the wound is large enough she
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_3_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>adds some lengthwise cuts and several more
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_3_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>incisions. The neighbor women carefully watch
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_3_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>her "work" and when needed encourage her
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_3_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>accomplishment.
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_3_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>The girl begins to howl once more. Some
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_3_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>times in a spasm at this stage, she bites off he
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_3_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>tongue. The other women carefully watch the
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_3_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>child to prevent such an accident. When her
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_4_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>tongue flops out they throw spice powder on it
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_4_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>which provokes an instant pulling back and the
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_4_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>little girl opens her mouth wide to scream even
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_4_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>harder.
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_4_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>With the abrasion of the skin completed ac
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_4_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>cording to the rules the operator closes the
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_4_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>bleeding large lips and fixes them one against
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_4_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>the other with long acacia thorns.
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_4_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>At this stage of the operation the child is
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_4_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>spent and exhausted and generally stops crying
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_4_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>but usually has convulsions. One then forces
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_4_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>down her throat a concoction of plants which
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_4_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>has rapid results.
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_4_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>The operator's chief concern is to achieve as
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_4_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>narrow an opening as possible, just big enough
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_4_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>to allow the urine and menstrual flow to pass.
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_4_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>Her honor depends on making it as small as
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_4_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>possible because among the Somalis the smaller
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_4_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>this artificial passage is, the higher the value of
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_4_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>the woman.
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_4_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>Once this operation is finished the woman
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_4_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>washes the sex area of the girl and wipes her
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_4_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>with a rag. Then the girl is freed (from having
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_4_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>been held down) and is ordered to get up. The
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_4_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>neighbors then help to immobilize her thighs
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_4_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>with ropes of goat skin. A solid bandage is then
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_4_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>applied from the knees to the waist of the girl
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_4_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>and is left in place for about two weeks. The
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_4_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>girl must remain immobile, stretched on a mat,
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_4_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>for the entire time while all the excrement

				<lb facs='#facs_33_r_7_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>Bradley asked when they could go back in

				<lb facs='#facs_33_r_7_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>Then her mother took a bottle of baby

				<lb facs='#facs_33_r_7_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>just lie down and he would rub it in for

				<lb facs='#facs_38_r_8_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>idea of a girdle. Its function is to mold one
				<lb facs='#facs_38_r_8_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>into society's ideal. It is completely dishonest
				<lb facs='#facs_38_r_8_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>It merely creates a facade. It is an uncom

				<lb facs='#facs_38_r_8_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>doesn't let air in or out. This is why I used

				<lb facs='#facs_38_r_8_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>are always attached to them. I used velvet

				<lb facs='#facs_38_r_8_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>age. She will be unattractive by society's
				<lb facs='#facs_38_r_8_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>standards. As a punishment for getting old,

				<lb facs='#facs_40_r_3_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>decided that feminists had to protest the

				<lb facs='#facs_44_r_6_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>It's hard to talk about South Africa without thinking constantly of the
				<lb facs='#facs_44_r_6_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>tremendous role that the U.S. plays in the repression and exploitation in
				<lb facs='#facs_44_r_6_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>South Africa. So we have two jobs in the U.S.—there is the very direct one
				<lb facs='#facs_44_r_6_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>of focusing attention on the political prisoners, to see that they are not
				<lb facs='#facs_44_r_6_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>forgotten, but the other, even greater responsibility is to challenge the poli-

				<lb facs='#facs_44_r_6_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>According to the South African government, there are no political pris
				<lb facs='#facs_44_r_6_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>oners. South Africa has a population of 25 million; 5 million whites and 20
				<lb facs='#facs_44_r_6_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>million Blacks. The 5 million whites have all the power and all the wealth,
				<lb facs='#facs_44_r_6_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>while the 20 million Blacks produce all the good things in life, the necessary
				<lb facs='#facs_44_r_6_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>things, and yet have nothing. I think it it true to say that all Black people in

				<lb facs='#facs_44_r_6_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>although unions are illegal for Black workers. They have gone on strike
				<lb facs='#facs_44_r_6_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>although when you strike in South Africa you face the boss and the police.
				<lb facs='#facs_44_r_6_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>They have fought against the pass system. They have fought as teachers

				<lb facs='#facs_45_r_9_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>lion women in this country who live in extreme poverty and millions more
				<lb facs='#facs_45_r_9_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>around the.world, I indict the entire medical system for the denial of basic hu-
				<lb facs='#facs_45_r_9_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>man care and services—prenatal, infant and preventative. I lay before you in
				<lb facs='#facs_45_r_9_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>particular the deaths of 40,000 babies a year in this country alone for lack of
				<lb facs='#facs_45_r_9_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>maternal nutrition and health services. I think the charge should be murder.
				<lb facs='#facs_45_r_9_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>The second particular indictment I want to bring forth is that health care has
				<lb facs='#facs_45_r_9_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>less and less to do with the needs of women and more and more to do with the
				<lb facs='#facs_45_r_9_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>priorities of the men who control it. I indict the medical profession in collusion
				<lb facs='#facs_45_r_9_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>with the owners and administrators of medical institutions for a relentless cam-
				<lb facs='#facs_45_r_9_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>paign of surgical aggression against women. In the nineteenth century it was the
				<lb facs='#facs_45_r_9_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>removal of the clitoris and the ovaries, performed to tame women and enrich
				<lb facs='#facs_45_r_9_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>doctors. Today the uterus and the ovaries are the principal targets. Hysterec

				<lb facs='#facs_45_r_9_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>performed for no good medical reason, and those unnecessary hysterectomies
				<lb facs='#facs_45_r_9_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>result in the deaths of approximately 6,000 women per year. The charge should
				<lb facs='#facs_45_r_9_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>be murder.

				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_2_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>ity regarding the question of non-violence.
				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_2_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>Many people have challenged the "vio
				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_2_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>lent" nature of the acts with which the
				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_2_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>four women have been charged. It has be
				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_2_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>come a question of ideology: "Is the
				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_2_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>women's movement non-violent, or not?
				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_2_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>The implication is that if we are not non

				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_2_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>to have and violence a negative one.
				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_2_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>Shortly after the arrests, I was in a
				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_2_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>room with a group of women discussing
				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_2_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>this topic. One said she approved of vio
				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_2_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>lence as a means to an end. One was into
				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_2_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>passive resistance. One preferred direct
				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_2_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>action. One thought that violence against
				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_2_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>property was okay, but not against peo-
				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_2_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>ple. One maintained we should actively
				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_2_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>practice self-defense. It began sounding
				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_2_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>vaguely like a Jules Feiffer cartoon. But
				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_2_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>an important issue was being raised. Are
				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_2_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>we, indeed, violent or not?
				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_2_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>For non-violence to have any meaning

				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_3_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>know it in contemporary society. Non-
				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_3_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>violence capitalizes on the fear that a rul

				<lb facs='#facs_47_r_9_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>outrage, the use of Third World women—Mexican, Puerto Rican and Chi-
				<lb facs='#facs_47_r_9_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>cano—by the drug companies as guinea pigs in the development of new
				<lb facs='#facs_47_r_9_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>hormonal products.
				<lb facs='#facs_47_r_9_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>Fifth, I would like to indict the medical profession for acting on its own and
				<lb facs='#facs_47_r_9_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>in collusion with drug companies in actively promoting and advancing sexist
				<lb facs='#facs_47_r_9_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>ideology, for taking the ancient male prejudice that women are passive, maso-
				<lb facs='#facs_47_r_9_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>chistic, hysterical, etc., and attempting to pass this kind of prejudice off as
				<lb facs='#facs_47_r_9_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>medical science, as biological truth. I must indict the medical system for using
				<lb facs='#facs_47_r_9_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>all its technological and institutional weapons to enforce this ideology on non
				<lb facs='#facs_47_r_9_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>conforming women. First, by imprisoning half a million women in this country
				<lb facs='#facs_47_r_9_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>alone in mental hospitals for failing to be feminine. And finally, by subjecting
				<lb facs='#facs_47_r_9_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>literally millions of women to chemical incarceration with mood-altering drugs,
				<lb facs='#facs_47_r_9_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>not only in mental hospitals, but in prisons, in every neighborhood and every
				<lb facs='#facs_47_r_9_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>place where women work.
				<lb facs='#facs_47_r_9_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>Finally, l'd like to indict the medical profession for its systematic exploita-
				<lb facs='#facs_47_r_9_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>tion of the 80% of health care workers in this country who are women. Most
				<lb facs='#facs_47_r_9_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>occupy powerless positions and are subject to harrassments, office speedups,
				<lb facs='#facs_47_r_9_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>and live on miserably low wages. I charge the owners and administrators of
				<lb facs='#facs_47_r_9_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>medical institutions with dictatorial oppression of these women, including con-
				<lb facs='#facs_47_r_9_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>spiracies against their attempts to organize as women and as workers.
				<lb facs='#facs_47_r_9_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>The medical system as we know it now, a system so perverted by sexism,
				<lb facs='#facs_47_r_9_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>racism and profiteering that it actually generates disease, arose with the male
				<lb facs='#facs_47_r_9_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>takeover of medicine. Yet that does not mean that those crimes would be
				<lb facs='#facs_47_r_9_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>redressed simply by a female takeover of medicine. More women doctors would
				<lb facs='#facs_47_r_9_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>be helpful—more hospital administrators, druggists and so on. But these things
				<lb facs='#facs_47_r_9_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>cannot change the problem as it exists today. At this point we're not only up
				<lb facs='#facs_47_r_9_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>against male medicine, we're up against capitalist medicine.
				<lb facs='#facs_47_r_9_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>I could say that sentence in two different ways—rape and exploitation may
				<lb facs='#facs_47_r_9_1_tl_45' n='N045'/>be analogous on many different levels. Class rule and male domination may be
				<lb facs='#facs_47_r_9_1_tl_46' n='N046'/>analogous and they may make for interesting metaphors, but they are not the
				<lb facs='#facs_47_r_9_1_tl_47' n='N047'/>same thing. We need an analysis that makes this clear to us if we're going to
				<lb facs='#facs_47_r_9_1_tl_48' n='N048'/>make these changes. Things have gone so far that there's no way to confront
				<lb facs='#facs_47_r_9_1_tl_49' n='N049'/>the medical system in this country or throughout Western capitalist countries
				<lb facs='#facs_47_r_9_1_tl_50' n='N050'/>without confronting the entire medical industrial complex with its ties to
				<lb facs='#facs_47_r_9_1_tl_51' n='N051'/>banking, its ties to agribusiness, its ties to the arms industry. There is no way to
				<lb facs='#facs_47_r_9_1_tl_52' n='N052'/>work for health, for food, shelter, security, those kinds of things, for all
				<lb facs='#facs_47_r_9_1_tl_53' n='N053'/>women, without confronting imperialism, and I don't mean by that rape (I
				<lb facs='#facs_47_r_9_1_tl_54' n='N054'/>mean political and economic imperialism), and without confronting capitalism
				<lb facs='#facs_47_r_9_1_tl_55' n='N055'/>as an international system.

				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_7_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>I arrived at the piazza in time to catch the tail end of the march. Thousands of
				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_7_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>women filled the main street leading from the square. The bulk of the demon-
				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_7_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>strators moved together in uneven rows flanked by a human cordon of girls,
				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_7_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>arms straining and pulling Sprigs of mimosa were everywhere, jammed into
				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_7_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>buttonholes, tucked in amongst curls or waving in hands. The younger women
				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_7_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>were having a wonderful time: their bodies swayed in unison to a chant and
				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_7_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>they ended each slogan with a laugh; arms linked or hand in hand, their heads
				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_7_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>bobbed together, touched gently, then separated only to come together again.
				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_7_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>To the right of me, a girl forming part of the security line drew my attention.
				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_7_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>She stood perpendicular to the marching women, her arms pulled out to each
				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_7_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>side of her, legs apart, feet planted firmly, head thrown back in throaty laugh-
				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_7_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>ter. Although she couldn't have been more than 16 or 17, her bosom was full
				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_7_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>under a white ruffled blouse. Her blue denim skirt was stretched to a tight "A
				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_7_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>and below it striped stockings alternated bright bands of color down her legs to
				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_7_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>where a pair of thick socks were turned down above heavy brown suede hiking
				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_7_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>shoes. She was ludicrous, unspeakably lovely and absolutely invincible because
				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_7_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>she didn't know defeat. A confusion of ringlets covered her head and she an-
				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_7_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>swered my stare with a spontaneous flash of teeth.
				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_7_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>I was beginning to feel better. I started to move with the other women, stay-
				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_7_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>ing for a few minutes with each different group, then quickening my pace to
				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_7_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>catch up with the next one and falling into step again. I had felt tired, dragged
				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_7_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>down, but now my body began to respond to the energy. I joined in the shout-
				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_7_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>ing, this time to the men looking on from the sidelines, the men watching us,
				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_7_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>hardly speaking to each other. Their faces were tight, controlled—some seri-
				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_7_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>ous, others slightly mocking, still others confused, displeased, angry? What
				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_7_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>was there that connected them and made them seem all of a piece? A rigidity
				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_7_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>perhaps, nothing spontaneous or natural. I sensed their fear and turned away.
				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_7_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>Coming into Piazza del Gesù we all yelled out, "Si, si, si, abortiamo la
				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_7_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>D.C.!"" and emotion grew in us at the image of the little grey men in their
				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_7_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>colorless offices, playing their humorless games, controlling, deciding behind
				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_7_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>the long windows of the old palazzo. Suddenly ranks closed against an elderly
				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_7_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>man who was trying to cut through the march: in the face of such unanimity he
				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_7_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>gave up and stepped back with a good-natured sigh. Further along there were
				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_7_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>cries of "no smoking—no smoking" and another man, protesting loudly that
				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_7_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>he only wanted to get to the tobacco shop on the other side of the street, was
				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_7_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>pushed back by a sea of female bodies. This was that rare moment when being a
				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_7_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>woman was all that was required for immediate acceptance and complete free-
				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_7_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>dom of movement. Yet to my amazement I saw a young couple hurrying
				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_7_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>through, the woman's head down as though she wanted to pass unnoticed and
				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_7_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>the man's arm protective around her, shielding her, his other hand raised to

				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_7_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>old reactions. Ahead of me a short-haired woman walking with a child paused
				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_7_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>to speak to a youngish man who had approached within a foot of the demon
				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_7_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>strators, girlfriend in tow. In a pleasant voice she instructed him to either go
				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_7_1_tl_45' n='N045'/>around the back end of the march or wait until everyone had passed. He stood
				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_7_1_tl_46' n='N046'/>stiff and unblinking. She repeated what she'd said in the same tone. After a
				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_7_1_tl_47' n='N047'/>moment's silence, the response came out low and dry, "Did I ask you
				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_7_1_tl_48' n='N048'/>anything?"

				<lb facs='#facs_55_r_50_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>saw a group of girls several deep, leaning toward someone at the edge of the
				<lb facs='#facs_55_r_50_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>crowd. The pushing came from the ones in the back and those caught in the
				<lb facs='#facs_55_r_50_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>crunch in the middle lifted up their faces as though to breathe better and they
				<lb facs='#facs_55_r_50_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>were laughing and shouting complaints. Another "maschio" (male?) who had
				<lb facs='#facs_55_r_50_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>tried unsuccessfully to invade the women's act, I thought with a chuckle. Then
				<lb facs='#facs_55_r_50_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>my eyes found the man. He was standing up straight just past the leaning girls
				<lb facs='#facs_55_r_50_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>and had somehow managed to put about a foot of space between him and

				<lb facs='#facs_55_r_50_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>dered by close-cropped hair, his face was a mask of rage. His shoulders were
				<lb facs='#facs_55_r_50_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>rigid and jerked with each lunge of his fists. They leapt out one after the other,
				<lb facs='#facs_55_r_50_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>again and again. I heard the dull thud of contact as his punches connected with
				<lb facs='#facs_55_r_50_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>the young faces pressed so close together in front of him. He was consciously in
				<lb facs='#facs_55_r_50_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>control, drawing in his fists, taking aim in a split second, striking again, his
				<lb facs='#facs_55_r_50_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>shoulders absorbing the shock as he followed through, a perfect machine of
				<lb facs='#facs_55_r_50_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>aggression.
				<lb facs='#facs_55_r_50_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>I stopped, rooted to the spot. Staring in horror at the scene, I felt my legs get
				<lb facs='#facs_55_r_50_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>weak, felt the uselessness of my two limp arms. My face seemed to ache with
				<lb facs='#facs_55_r_50_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>every punch and the nausea starting in my stomach moved in ever-widening
				<lb facs='#facs_55_r_50_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>circles over my body. The bodies of the girls in front fell back with the blows
				<lb facs='#facs_55_r_50_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>only to be carried forward again from behind. Immobilized, frozen, only my
				<lb facs='#facs_55_r_50_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>brain pleaded for someone to take action. By this time, other women were join-
				<lb facs='#facs_55_r_50_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>ing in at the back and I heard a mature female voice shout out instructions to
				<lb facs='#facs_55_r_50_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>those in front to kick. A flurry of feet went out, flailing the air. When I looked
				<lb facs='#facs_55_r_50_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>past them the man was gone. There was confusion among the women and
				<lb facs='#facs_55_r_50_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>someone cried out in disappointment, "You mean no one was able to get
				<lb facs='#facs_55_r_50_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>him?" Then someone moaned and I saw a young girl, her face pale against her
				<lb facs='#facs_55_r_50_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>long brown hair, swoon as several pairs of arms went out to buoy her up. There
				<lb facs='#facs_55_r_50_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>was pain on her upturned face and blood trickled down from each side of her
				<lb facs='#facs_55_r_50_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>nose. It was then that I noticed the ominous silence around me. There was no
				<lb facs='#facs_55_r_50_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>sound, no movement in the crowd. But these were men too, men who knew
				<lb facs='#facs_55_r_50_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>how to punch, men who could have stopped the machine of aggression by
				<lb facs='#facs_55_r_50_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>force. A bearded young man looked over at the group of girls, now subdued,
				<lb facs='#facs_55_r_50_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>and nodding grimly toward the bar behind him, said in a quiet voice, "The bar
				<lb facs='#facs_55_r_50_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>.. take her to the bar." Inside the march, the last group of women was strid-
				<lb facs='#facs_55_r_50_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>ing by and their words resounded in my empty head like a bad joke:
				<lb facs='#facs_55_r_50_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>"Come mai, come mai,

				<lb facs='#facs_60_r_2_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>abuse of women as uniquely the problem
				<lb facs='#facs_60_r_2_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>of contemporary society. Much of the re
				<lb facs='#facs_60_r_2_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>search being conducted in the area tends
				<lb facs='#facs_60_r_2_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>to perpetuate this view. For example,
				<lb facs='#facs_60_r_2_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>studies have been published that attempt
				<lb facs='#facs_60_r_2_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>to relate wife abuse to social phenomena
				<lb facs='#facs_60_r_2_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>such as drug addiction, alcoholism and
				<lb facs='#facs_60_r_2_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>unemployment. I understand there is a
				<lb facs='#facs_60_r_2_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>study now being conducted that draws a
				<lb facs='#facs_60_r_2_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>relationship between the rise of the wom
				<lb facs='#facs_60_r_2_1_tl_45' n='N045'/>en's liberation movement and wife abuse.
				<lb facs='#facs_60_r_2_1_tl_46' n='N046'/>In addition, there has been a tendency for
				<lb facs='#facs_60_r_2_1_tl_47' n='N047'/>researchers to "psychologize" the prob
				<lb facs='#facs_60_r_2_1_tl_48' n='N048'/>lem, to seek an explanation for the bat
				<lb facs='#facs_60_r_2_1_tl_49' n='N049'/>tering of women in the psychological
				<lb facs='#facs_60_r_2_1_tl_50' n='N050'/>makeup of the individuals involved.
				<lb facs='#facs_60_r_2_1_tl_51' n='N051'/>Explanations are put forth that men beat
				<lb facs='#facs_60_r_2_1_tl_52' n='N052'/>their wives because they feel insecure,
				<lb facs='#facs_60_r_2_1_tl_53' n='N053'/>intimidated or inadequate; or, on the
				<lb facs='#facs_60_r_2_1_tl_54' n='N054'/>other hand, because the women beaten are
				<lb facs='#facs_60_r_2_1_tl_55' n='N055'/>in reality masochistic provocateurs.

				<lb facs='#facs_60_l' n='N001'/>Both these approaches, it seems to me,
				<lb facs='#facs_60_r_3_1_tl_1' n='N002'/>serve to obscure rather than illuminate the
				<lb facs='#facs_60_r_3_1_tl_2' n='N003'/>problem. By seeking the causes of wife
				<lb facs='#facs_60_r_3_1_tl_3' n='N004'/>abuse solely in the context of contempo
				<lb facs='#facs_60_r_3_1_tl_4' n='N005'/>rary capitalist society, we lose sight of the
				<lb facs='#facs_60_r_3_1_tl_5' n='N006'/>fact that women have been physically
				<lb facs='#facs_60_r_3_1_tl_6' n='N007'/>abused in virtually every culture since the
				<lb facs='#facs_60_r_3_1_tl_7' n='N008'/>dawn of civilization. The abuse of women
				<lb facs='#facs_60_r_3_1_tl_8' n='N009'/>is, ultimately, a problem that emerges
				<lb facs='#facs_60_r_3_1_tl_9' n='N010'/>from the history of Man. Thus research

				<lb facs='#facs_60_r_3_1_tl_11' n='N012'/>as ideology, that is to say it obscures and
				<lb facs='#facs_60_r_3_1_tl_12' n='N013'/>perpetuates wife abuse, first, by dealing
				<lb facs='#facs_60_r_3_1_tl_13' n='N014'/>with battering as an issue separate and
				<lb facs='#facs_60_r_3_1_tl_14' n='N015'/>apart from rather than internally related
				<lb facs='#facs_60_r_3_1_tl_15' n='N016'/>and integral to the totality of woman's
				<lb facs='#facs_60_r_3_1_tl_16' n='N017'/>oppression and, second, by failing to per

				<lb facs='#facs_60_r_3_1_tl_18' n='N019'/>text. The history of women has been a
				<lb facs='#facs_60_r_3_1_tl_19' n='N020'/>history of oppression, and this oppression
				<lb facs='#facs_60_r_3_1_tl_20' n='N021'/>has been both sustained and punctuated
				<lb facs='#facs_60_r_3_1_tl_21' n='N022'/>by force and violence.

				<lb facs='#facs_60_r_4_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>are able to get a much more accurate view
				<lb facs='#facs_60_r_4_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>of what women's lives were like. Among
				<lb facs='#facs_60_r_4_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>the early Greeks, Aristotle and others
				<lb facs='#facs_60_r_4_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>argued on the natural inferiority of wom

				<lb facs='#facs_60_r_4_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>male to rule the female. As Bullough
				<lb facs='#facs_60_r_4_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>states, "Greek literature from the poets to
				<lb facs='#facs_60_r_4_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>the playwrights was essentially misogy-

				<lb facs='#facs_60_r_4_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>and Euripides argued that women "ought

				<lb facs='#facs_60_r_4_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>ought not to speak first, and ought not to

				<lb facs='#facs_60_r_4_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>nor heard. They were regarded as gossipy,
				<lb facs='#facs_60_r_4_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>immoral and, of course, vastly inferior to
				<lb facs='#facs_60_r_4_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>the male. The Greek husband had the

				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_1_1_tl_11' n='N010'/>institution.
				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_1_1_tl_12' n='N011'/>Even though they are caricatures of normal sex life and romance, homosexual
				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_1_1_tl_13' n='N012'/>affairs in prisons or jails are no joke, and should not be treated as such. They should
				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_1_1_tl_14' n='N013'/>be promptly broken up. This is particularly important because even fairly normal in
				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_1_1_tl_15' n='N014'/>dividuals may learn homosexual practices in prison if they are not properly supervised
				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_1_1_tl_16' n='N015'/>and protected from "wolves"
				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_1_1_tl_17' n='N016'/>When they are released, they may be unable to take
				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_1_1_tl_18' n='N017'/>up a normal sex life. It is the duty of the correction officer not only to protect society
				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_1_1_tl_19' n='N018'/>from the inmate during the process of rehabilitation but also to protect an inmate from
				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_1_1_tl_20' n='N019'/>other inmates who may damage, weaken, coarsen, or otherwise destroy what is left of
				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_1_1_tl_21' n='N020'/>his moral fibre. Just because homosexual tendencies are almost inevitable in prison
				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_1_1_tl_22' n='N021'/>life because of the absence of normal sexual opportunities, the custodial officer must
				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_1_1_tl_23' n='N022'/>not relax a stern suppression of sexual deviation.
				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_1_1_tl_24' n='N023'/>This doesn't mean that all individuals who try homosexual experiences will end uy
				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_1_1_tl_25' n='N024'/>being confirmed homosexuals. Kinsey reports that 37% of the male subjects he and
				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_1_1_tl_26' n='N025'/>others interviewed reported one or more homosexual experiences since adolescence but
				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_1_1_tl_27' n='N026'/>only 4% of the group interviewed were exclusively homosexual. However, there are
				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_1_1_tl_28' n='N027'/>always dangers in this type of experience, subject to the essential makeup of the per-
				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_1_1_tl_29' n='N028'/>son or the intensity of the experience he undergoes.
				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_1_1_tl_30' n='N029'/>Although the approach varies in different facilities, most prisons and jails require
				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_1_1_tl_31' n='N030'/>that known homosexuals be kept under strict surveillance, if not segregation. Despite
				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_1_1_tl_32' n='N031'/>the revolting nature of their acts, homosexuals should not be ridiculed or otherwise
				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_1_1_tl_33' n='N032'/>brought to the attention of other prisoners as homosexuals. Whatever we may think
				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_1_1_tl_34' n='N033'/>of them, they are still entitled to the same fair treatment that any other prisoner would
				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_1_1_tl_35' n='N034'/>get. In addition, not all people with characteristics of their opposite sex such as male
				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_1_1_tl_36' n='N035'/>sissies or mannish women are necessarily homosexual.

				<lb facs='#facs_71_r_2_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>smaller families that can afford to educate

				<lb facs='#facs_71_r_2_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>growth of the society. Thus, families are

				<lb facs='#facs_71_r_2_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>middle-class existence.
				<lb facs='#facs_71_r_2_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>More recently, some population experts
				<lb facs='#facs_71_r_2_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>have acknowledged that the promise of a

				<lb facs='#facs_73_r_1_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>economics has been shown to be faulty.

				<lb facs='#facs_75_r_1_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>this process by talking more to each other
				<lb facs='#facs_75_r_1_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>about the meaning of reproduction, the

				<lb facs='#facs_78_r_4_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>selves predicated on and preserved by violence.

				<lb facs='#facs_79_r_2_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>Love and violence (says R.D. Laing) are
				<lb facs='#facs_79_r_2_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>polar opposites. Love lets the other be,
				<lb facs='#facs_79_r_2_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>but with affection and concern. Violence
				<lb facs='#facs_79_r_2_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>attempts to constrain the other's freedom,
				<lb facs='#facs_79_r_2_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>to force him (sic) to act in the way we
				<lb facs='#facs_79_r_2_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>desire, but with ultimate lack of concern,
				<lb facs='#facs_79_r_2_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>with indifference to the other's own
				<lb facs='#facs_79_r_2_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>existence or destiny
				<lb facs='#facs_79_r_2_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>We are effectively destroying ourselves
				<lb facs='#facs_79_r_2_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>by violence masquerading as love.
				<lb facs='#facs_79_r_2_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>In the social arena, violence is institution
				<lb facs='#facs_79_r_2_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>alized as "culture," "our heritage." The
				<lb facs='#facs_79_r_2_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>implication is that that heritage is univer
				<lb facs='#facs_79_r_2_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>sal—for all of us, by all of us. But that's a
				<lb facs='#facs_79_r_2_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>lie and one which permeates and violates
				<lb facs='#facs_79_r_2_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>every aspect of our existence. That heri
				<lb facs='#facs_79_r_2_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>tage, for example, tells us that capitalism
				<lb facs='#facs_79_r_2_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>is good, socialism bad and unnatural; that
				<lb facs='#facs_79_r_2_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>men are not maternal; that women can'

				<lb facs='#facs_79_r_2_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>dumb. It is a society's ideologies that dis
				<lb facs='#facs_79_r_2_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>guise and codify social violence. "Ideolo
				<lb facs='#facs_79_r_2_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>gy is an outlook," says Alan Wallach,
				<lb facs='#facs_79_r_2_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>"that somehow corresponds to or serves
				<lb facs='#facs_79_r_2_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>to advance the interests of a ruling class,
				<lb facs='#facs_79_r_2_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>that is, an outlook that is class-determined
				<lb facs='#facs_79_r_2_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>... ideology is class domination in the
				<lb facs='#facs_79_r_2_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>realm of ideas."2 Cornelius Castoriadis
				<lb facs='#facs_79_r_2_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>elucidates ideology as: "an invocation of
				<lb facs='#facs_79_r_2_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>fictive entities, pseudo-rational construc
				<lb facs='#facs_79_r_2_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>tions and abstract principles which, con
				<lb facs='#facs_79_r_2_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>cretely, justify and hide a social-historical
				<lb facs='#facs_79_r_2_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>practice whose true signification lies else
				<lb facs='#facs_79_r_2_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>where."3
				<lb facs='#facs_79_r_2_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>It is crucial to note here that there is a
				<lb facs='#facs_79_r_2_1_tl_45' n='N045'/>kernel of truth in ruling-class ideologies,
				<lb facs='#facs_79_r_2_1_tl_46' n='N046'/>and it is that bit of truth that guarantees
				<lb facs='#facs_79_r_2_1_tl_47' n='N047'/>the tyranny. For example, if we look at the
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_79_r_3_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>ideology of capitalism we find that it per
				<lb facs='#facs_79_r_3_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>suades us that competition is natural, and
				<lb facs='#facs_79_r_3_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>that everyone can compete equally. Each
				<lb facs='#facs_79_r_3_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>statement seems to be at least a little true
				<lb facs='#facs_79_r_3_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>And both the truth and the lie can be lo
				<lb facs='#facs_79_r_3_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>cated in the material realities of capital
				<lb facs='#facs_79_r_3_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>ism. Women, for example, can compete
				<lb facs='#facs_79_r_3_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>for most jobs, but they certainly will no
				<lb facs='#facs_79_r_3_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>get them, and for the work they do find
				<lb facs='#facs_79_r_3_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>they will be underpaid.
				<lb facs='#facs_79_r_3_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>Since it is in the interest of capitalism to
				<lb facs='#facs_79_r_3_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>parade its ostensible belief in freedom, the
				<lb facs='#facs_79_r_3_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>competitive element is stressed, the stric
				<lb facs='#facs_79_r_3_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>tures on freedom ignored or denied. And
				<lb facs='#facs_79_r_3_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>what we are left with is a bewildering set of
				<lb facs='#facs_79_r_3_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>experiences in which our primary sense of
				<lb facs='#facs_79_r_3_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>constricted freedom is belied by the cul
				<lb facs='#facs_79_r_3_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>ture's myths. We are led to distrust our
				<lb facs='#facs_79_r_3_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>instincts which tell us that we are unfree
				<lb facs='#facs_79_r_3_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>because, after all, there does seem to be
				<lb facs='#facs_79_r_3_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>some freedom. Because of that bit of free
				<lb facs='#facs_79_r_3_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>dom, that kernel of truth, we become un
				<lb facs='#facs_79_r_3_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>sure of our ability to comprehend, and
				<lb facs='#facs_79_r_3_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>faith in our own perceptual apparatus is
				<lb facs='#facs_79_r_3_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>violated.
				<lb facs='#facs_79_r_3_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>Long before I understood the meaning
				<lb facs='#facs_79_r_3_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>of "ideology," I had unwittingly begun to
				<lb facs='#facs_79_r_3_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>observe and remark its machinations in
				<lb facs='#facs_79_r_3_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>my research as an art historian. I was
				<lb facs='#facs_79_r_3_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>working on Degas and his social milieu
				<lb facs='#facs_79_r_3_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>and was particularly interested in how his
				<lb facs='#facs_79_r_3_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>upper-class status affected the transfor
				<lb facs='#facs_79_r_3_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>mation of social realities in his art. That is,
				<lb facs='#facs_79_r_3_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>I wondered how his wealth and customs,
				<lb facs='#facs_79_r_3_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>for example, affected his view of laundres
				<lb facs='#facs_79_r_3_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>ses, milliners, dancers, prostitutes and so
				<lb facs='#facs_79_r_3_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>forth. In order to assess his transforma
				<lb facs='#facs_79_r_3_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>tion, I began to do extensive research on
				<lb facs='#facs_79_r_3_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>contemporary labor realities. The first
				<lb facs='#facs_79_r_3_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>profession I investigated was laundering. I
				<lb facs='#facs_79_r_3_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>found that the realities of the trade were
				<lb facs='#facs_79_r_3_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>far indeed from any visual depictions that
				<lb facs='#facs_79_r_3_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>I found either by Degas or the myriad
				<lb facs='#facs_79_r_3_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>other artists who depicted the subject.
				<lb facs='#facs_79_r_3_1_tl_45' n='N045'/>By the end of the 19th century there
				<lb facs='#facs_79_r_3_1_tl_46' n='N046'/>were a few factory-size laundries in
				<lb facs='#facs_79_r_3_1_tl_47' n='N047'/>France, but the majority of shops were still
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_79_r_4_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>small, with one to four workers. Women
				<lb facs='#facs_79_r_4_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>were employed almost exclusively. Al

				<lb facs='#facs_79_r_4_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>for all women and children under 18, fam

				<lb facs='#facs_79_r_4_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>and so in the small shops the women con
				<lb facs='#facs_79_r_4_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>tinued to work up to 15 and even 18 hours
				<lb facs='#facs_79_r_4_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>a day, rising at 5 A.M. and working till 11
				<lb facs='#facs_79_r_4_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>P.M.4
				<lb facs='#facs_79_r_4_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>Unemployment was chronic. And when
				<lb facs='#facs_79_r_4_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>laundresses worked it was backbreaking
				<lb facs='#facs_79_r_4_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>and paid little. Ironers maneuvered
				<lb facs='#facs_79_r_4_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>5-pound irons in devastating heat; washer
				<lb facs='#facs_79_r_4_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>women trudged through the city balancing
				<lb facs='#facs_79_r_4_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>20 pounds of linen on their hips. The
				<lb facs='#facs_79_r_4_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>ironers were the better paid and more
				<lb facs='#facs_79_r_4_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>regularly employed of the two; they were
				<lb facs='#facs_79_r_4_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>the artisans or skilled laborérs of the trade.
				<lb facs='#facs_79_r_4_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>In 1881 a laundress earned an average of

				<lb facs='#facs_79_r_4_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>tailors earned between 5 and 10 francs;

				<lb facs='#facs_80_r_2_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>first performance coming out of a female
				<lb facs='#facs_80_r_2_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>consciousness, that I became a feminist.
				<lb facs='#facs_80_r_2_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>Prior to this performance my work had
				<lb facs='#facs_80_r_2_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>been consistent with the concerns of the
				<lb facs='#facs_80_r_2_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>sixties, an involvement with formal art
				<lb facs='#facs_80_r_2_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>problems rather than content. Early in my
				<lb facs='#facs_80_r_2_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>career I began to see that to evolve fully a

				<lb facs='#facs_80_r_2_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>on my life. This process of self-realization
				<lb facs='#facs_80_r_2_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>began with Menstruation-Wait. The first
				<lb facs='#facs_80_r_2_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>Wait took place in Los Angeles in 1971,

				<lb facs='#facs_80_r_2_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>presence. In so doing I attempted to break
				<lb facs='#facs_80_r_2_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>down myths about menstruation as well as

				<lb facs='#facs_80_r_2_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>was rude at times (hanging painted red

				<lb facs='#facs_80_r_3_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>seemed appropriately close to feminist
				<lb facs='#facs_80_r_3_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>ideology and the art coming out of the
				<lb facs='#facs_80_r_3_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>movement. The large-scale monumenta

				<lb facs='#facs_80_r_3_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>symbolized the kind of synthesis between
				<lb facs='#facs_80_r_3_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>art and politics I wanted to move toward
				<lb facs='#facs_80_r_3_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>There was no visible feminist art in Ger

				<lb facs='#facs_80_r_3_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>planted within a well-organized network
				<lb facs='#facs_80_r_3_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>of radical feminist groups throughout the
				<lb facs='#facs_80_r_3_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>country. Like myself, these women were
				<lb facs='#facs_80_r_3_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>influenced by the artists I have men
				<lb facs='#facs_80_r_3_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>tioned. Within the already politically con
				<lb facs='#facs_80_r_3_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>scious feminist groups the ties to working
				<lb facs='#facs_80_r_3_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>class women and housewives were deep
				<lb facs='#facs_80_r_3_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>rooted. The art that was beginning to
				<lb facs='#facs_80_r_3_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>come out reflected those ties. The direc
				<lb facs='#facs_80_r_3_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>tion of the development of women's cul

				<lb facs='#facs_80_r_3_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>U.S. although these women were certainly
				<lb facs='#facs_80_r_3_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>influenced by the "personal" approach
				<lb facs='#facs_80_r_3_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>that began the movement here.
				<lb facs='#facs_80_r_3_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>After Menstruation-Wait I consciously
				<lb facs='#facs_80_r_3_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>moved out of the art world and began
				<lb facs='#facs_80_r_3_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>teaching art at a German Gymnasium. My
				<lb facs='#facs_80_r_3_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>first actual connection with a women's
				<lb facs='#facs_80_r_3_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>community began there with a class of
				<lb facs='#facs_80_r_3_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>young women. While I initially saw teach-

				<lb facs='#facs_80_r_3_1_tl_45' n='N045'/>here that I found the basis for the art form
				<lb facs='#facs_80_r_3_1_tl_46' n='N046'/>characteristic of the direction my work
				<lb facs='#facs_80_r_3_1_tl_47' n='N047'/>would take in the future. I guided the class
				<lb facs='#facs_80_r_3_1_tl_48' n='N048'/>through collaborative performances based
				<lb facs='#facs_80_r_3_1_tl_49' n='N049'/>on a critical analysis of fashion and
				<lb facs='#facs_80_r_3_1_tl_50' n='N050'/>makeup. We made costumes, masks, col
				<lb facs='#facs_80_r_3_1_tl_51' n='N051'/>lages, as performance props. These pieces
				<lb facs='#facs_80_r_3_1_tl_52' n='N052'/>were private but were filmed and shown
				<lb facs='#facs_80_r_3_1_tl_53' n='N053'/>publicly.

				<lb facs='#facs_81_r_1_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>women who had experienced rape. With

				<lb facs='#facs_81_r_1_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>worked to create a performance on rape.

				<lb facs='#facs_81_r_1_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>obscured by the preyailing myth that no

				<lb facs='#facs_81_r_1_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>The strategy behind this first piece was to
				<lb facs='#facs_81_r_1_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>convince the audience of the reality of the
				<lb facs='#facs_81_r_1_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>problem, and to initiate a cultural context

				<lb facs='#facs_81_r_1_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>Ablutions began as a collection of ora
				<lb facs='#facs_81_r_1_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>histories. For me the translation of this
				<lb facs='#facs_81_r_1_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>sociological information into art marked a

				<lb facs='#facs_81_r_1_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>satisfied with feminist organizing at the
				<lb facs='#facs_81_r_1_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>grass roots level or within the professional

				<lb facs='#facs_81_r_1_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>energy without nourishing me. At Fresno
				<lb facs='#facs_81_r_1_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>I met Judy Chicago and entered the Femi

				<lb facs='#facs_81_r_1_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>that the creation of art, no matter how

				<lb facs='#facs_81_r_1_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>as no direct political activity had done.
				<lb facs='#facs_81_r_1_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>The act of making art somehow mitigated

				<lb facs='#facs_81_r_1_1_tl_45' n='N045'/>consisted largely of college students and

				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_8_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>Notes
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_8_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>1. Feminist art is art created out of the unique con
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_8_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>sciousness of being female, a consciousness which
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_8_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>implies an awareness not only of the singular treat
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_8_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>ment afforded to one because of gender, but also
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_8_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>an awareness of one's relatedness to all other mem
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_8_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>bers of that group. Implicit in the work is the
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_8_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>artist's knowledge of the history of women as a
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_8_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>class and their struggles to emerge from oppression.
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_8_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>Feminist art links itself to this ongoing struggle and
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_8_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>is invested with the belief in women's ability to
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_8_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>create cultural equality.
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_8_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>Strong feminist art might or might not appear to
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_8_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>be political according to conventional definitions.
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_8_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>By virtue of its expression of an oppressed and
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_8_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>hidden cultural experience, it will always in fact be
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_8_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>political. In the most directed of such art its pur
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_8_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>pose (and contrary to the myth of functionless art
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_8_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>as high art, it does have a purpose), as stated by art
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_8_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>historian Arlene Raven, is "to provide information
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_8_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>about women's experience, invite an exchange with

				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_8_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>transform culture. As information expressed in

				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_8_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>conventions about the nature of art; it must create

				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_2_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>lation between violence and society.
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_2_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>Violence is a word of "longstanding

				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_2_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>violence (physical, emotional) there are
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_2_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>esentially two broad categories: sanc

				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_2_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>lence. We tend to notice only the latter.
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_2_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>Sanctioned violence is supposedly used to

				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_2_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>violence here as the forcible interference
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_2_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>of personal freedom whether sanctioned

				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_2_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>hunter then a victim?). History textbooks
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_2_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>tell us that man transforms the natural

				<lb facs='#facs_100_r_3_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>When my rapist knocked on the door a few weeks later, I laughed to myself.
				<lb facs='#facs_100_r_3_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>Not only did he have to answer my "Who's there?" but also my "Whaddaya
				<lb facs='#facs_100_r_3_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>want?" Rural neighborliness long lost, replaced at first by the fear any country
				<lb facs='#facs_100_r_3_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>girl learns in her first moment in the Greyhound terminal and over time by the
				<lb facs='#facs_100_r_3_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>acquired deference to cities that true hicks are known for, my joviality and wit
				<lb facs='#facs_100_r_3_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>took over. The fake brass deadbolt between him and me, less cumbersome than
				<lb facs='#facs_100_r_3_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>a chastity belt, made me grin. The best defense is a good offense, my friend
				<lb facs='#facs_100_r_3_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>Katy had said by way of advice on my first night tricking. With equally off
				<lb facs='#facs_100_r_3_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>handed practicality I got rid of him.
				<lb facs='#facs_100_r_3_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>When I had both stopped shaking and started eating pea soup with a friend
				<lb facs='#facs_100_r_3_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>who could not lend me his silver Cordoba with maroon leather interior, I fin
				<lb facs='#facs_100_r_3_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>ally sighed. I didn't want pea soup and I did want to roll my terror around town
				<lb facs='#facs_100_r_3_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>in a tinted glass cocoon. Self-indulgence didn't seem like such an unmeritorious
				<lb facs='#facs_100_r_3_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>hedge against the female condition. Nobody has to know why you order extra
				<lb facs='#facs_100_r_3_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>croissants or weekly daffodils or something from the Tupperware woman at
				<lb facs='#facs_100_r_3_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>work. You don't have to tell some Dagwood that you're Blondie today. After
				<lb facs='#facs_100_r_3_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>all, I even worked rapists now.
				<lb facs='#facs_100_r_3_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>When several months had passed, I cried. Admittedly I pitied myself at the
				<lb facs='#facs_100_r_3_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>lack of my own Cordoba but since deep inside I really wanted a navy Mercedes
				<lb facs='#facs_100_r_3_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>top-of-the-line sporty job, I knew the tears were real. Tricking having given
				<lb facs='#facs_100_r_3_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>way long ago to the notion that if I was my own pimp, why trick, I had kept
				<lb facs='#facs_100_r_3_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>myself busy nosing around used car lots after five. Less in control of my
				<lb facs='#facs_100_r_3_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>income, I had more time to rant to myself about injustice.
				<lb facs='#facs_100_r_3_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>I had started crying when I saw a dented rich-blue Riviera but stopped
				<lb facs='#facs_100_r_3_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>temporarily as I passed the slick operator's lot full of shiny red muscle cars with
				<lb facs='#facs_100_r_3_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>jacked-up rear ends. Their implicitly bankrupt, young, previous owners,
				<lb facs='#facs_100_r_3_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>country fellows living in town now, had annoyed me once with cheap-skate
				<lb facs='#facs_100_r_3_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>attitudes and downright ignorance. Apparently they also didn't know how to
				<lb facs='#facs_100_r_3_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>buy cars. But when I looked a second time at the row of raised behinds, all
				<lb facs='#facs_100_r_3_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>stickered at a good grand above their next owners' ignorant ability to pay, I
				<lb facs='#facs_100_r_3_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>knew I had been crying for a reason.

				<lb facs='#facs_101_r_1_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>When I thought about the navy Mercedes—from time to time—I was grati
				<lb facs='#facs_101_r_1_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>fied by its unattainability. Why whore when you can dream with no effort, I
				<lb facs='#facs_101_r_1_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>must have said one offensive day, tearlessly. So years after tricking, when I was
				<lb facs='#facs_101_r_1_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>raped in my living room by a welcomed acquaintance who asked for a ride
				<lb facs='#facs_101_r_1_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>home after, I rocked with some comfort while he caught a cab in the street
				<lb facs='#facs_101_r_1_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>below. In the country there are lots of rocking chairs but no cabs. No escapes
				<lb facs='#facs_101_r_1_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>that aren't of your own making. No easy ways to send tedious callers away
				<lb facs='#facs_101_r_1_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>without inhospitably admitting that you were dubious about answering the bell.

				<lb facs='#facs_101_r_1_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>I started to cry again by the Lincoln-Mercury showroom as rusty Impalas
				<lb facs='#facs_101_r_1_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>and a lot of foreign makes whizzed by. I don't like Cougars—they get tawdry
				<lb facs='#facs_101_r_1_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>with age—and Continentals remind me of Dagwood's cartoon dreams. This is
				<lb facs='#facs_101_r_1_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>serious, Katy might have said. So much ugly metal perpetrated on all kinds of
				<lb facs='#facs_101_r_1_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>people, I reflected, adding to myself, What has Ralph Nader done about rape,
				<lb facs='#facs_101_r_1_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>anyway? But keeping my injustices in perspective, I shifted to acknowledge a
				<lb facs='#facs_101_r_1_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>right-on-red turn by some hurried 'Vette and noted that if I was crying, it was
				<lb facs='#facs_101_r_1_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>raining.
				<lb facs='#facs_101_r_1_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>In the city it's easy enough to come in out of the rain. Nobody yells, Shut the
				<lb facs='#facs_101_r_1_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>damn door—were you brought up in a barn? Nobody sighs, It's busier in
				<lb facs='#facs_101_r_1_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>here'n Grand Central Station. Nobody gives a hoot if you're crying as long as
				<lb facs='#facs_101_r_1_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>you don't talk to the other customers or drool. Nobody cares how you make a
				<lb facs='#facs_101_r_1_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>buck as long as you pay for coffee with something smaller than a five and don't
				<lb facs='#facs_101_r_1_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>park in their loading zone. So you can sit where it's warm and think about a
				<lb facs='#facs_101_r_1_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>Mercedes and weep with indulgence. The waitress might glower to let you know
				<lb facs='#facs_101_r_1_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>that after work she returns to some block where people don't cry—or
				<lb facs='#facs_101_r_1_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>drool—but if you put the tip by the saucer early on, you're permitted sadness.
				<lb facs='#facs_101_r_1_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>As long as you're not a regular and know she's a lying creampuff who cried
				<lb facs='#facs_101_r_1_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>over Lynda Bird's and Tricia's weddings.
				<lb facs='#facs_101_r_1_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>He came in with a woman who had worked the three best hotels for years

				<lb facs='#facs_101_r_1_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>were as lackluster about it all as she. Maybe she didn't like clothes or cars, or in
				<lb facs='#facs_101_r_1_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>choosing not to have a habit had chosen not to get desperate. She exchanged
				<lb facs='#facs_101_r_1_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>rain talk with the waitress. Now he was doing the glowering, but he also, I
				<lb facs='#facs_101_r_1_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>noted, paid for the coffee. As city folks do, we exchanged glances without
				<lb facs='#facs_101_r_1_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>recognition, my tears having stopped lest I look vulnerable to Rag Lady
				<lb facs='#facs_101_r_1_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>drooling nearby, or suspicious to the female undercover cop checking her
				<lb facs='#facs_101_r_1_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>crowsfeet in the mirror behind the pie cabinet. For a moment I laughed to

				<lb facs='#facs_108_r_1_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>This type of evidence puts before the

				<lb facs='#facs_108_r_2_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>rage rather than acceptance. To some ex

				<lb facs='#facs_108_r_2_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>an attack, however, rage is rarely the sole
				<lb facs='#facs_108_r_2_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>motivating force.82 A woman's state of
				<lb facs='#facs_108_r_2_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>mind at the time of the homicide is com
				<lb facs='#facs_108_r_2_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>plex. It probably includes some feeling of
				<lb facs='#facs_108_r_2_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>fear (immediate or otherwise), rage, panic.
				<lb facs='#facs_108_r_2_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>humiliation, shame, abject terror and an

				<lb facs='#facs_108_r_2_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>case. If rage is put before the jury within

				<lb facs='#facs_116_r_1_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>ableness of Inez Garcia's conduct included the
				<lb facs='#facs_116_r_1_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>following: that she had seen the man she shot,
				<lb facs='#facs_116_r_1_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>Miguel Jimenez, beat up her housemate earliei
				<lb facs='#facs_116_r_1_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>in the evening; that later that night Jimenez had
				<lb facs='#facs_116_r_1_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>acted as an accomplice to her rape; that shortly
				<lb facs='#facs_116_r_1_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>after the rape he threatened her over the
				<lb facs='#facs_116_r_1_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>telephone; that when she left the house carrying
				<lb facs='#facs_116_r_1_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>a loaded rifle she was terrified, angry and
				<lb facs='#facs_116_r_1_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>humiliated by having been raped; that when she
				<lb facs='#facs_116_r_1_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>came upon Jimenez and the rapist, Jimenez was
				<lb facs='#facs_116_r_1_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>holding a knife. All of this convinced her that
				<lb facs='#facs_116_r_1_1_tl_45' n='N045'/>he was capable of killing her. This factual
				<lb facs='#facs_116_r_1_1_tl_46' n='N046'/>evidence was supplemented by testimony from

				<lb facs='#facs_116_r_1_1_tl_48' n='N048'/>99. Voir dire (French for "speak the truth") usually
				<lb facs='#facs_116_r_1_1_tl_49' n='N049'/>refers to the examination by the court or by the
				<lb facs='#facs_116_r_1_1_tl_50' n='N050'/>attorneys of prospective jurors to determine
				<lb facs='#facs_116_r_1_1_tl_51' n='N051'/>their qualifications for jury service.
				<lb facs='#facs_116_r_1_1_tl_52' n='N052'/>100. The scope of voir dire examination of the jury
				<lb facs='#facs_116_r_1_1_tl_53' n='N053'/>varies from state to state. Some states will allow
				<lb facs='#facs_116_r_1_1_tl_54' n='N054'/>an extensive voir dire by counsel and a minimal
				<lb facs='#facs_116_r_1_1_tl_55' n='N055'/>voir dire by the judge. See, e.g., Cal. Penal
				<lb facs='#facs_116_r_1_1_tl_56' n='N056'/>Code § 1078 (1972); N.C. Gen. Stat. ch. 9 §9-1:
				<lb facs='#facs_116_r_1_1_tl_57' n='N057'/>(1967). In other states, as well as in federal
				<lb facs='#facs_116_r_1_1_tl_58' n='N058'/>court, voir dire is largely conducted by the
				<lb facs='#facs_116_r_1_1_tl_59' n='N059'/>judge. See, e.g., Mass. Ann. Laws ch. 234 § 28
				<lb facs='#facs_116_r_1_1_tl_60' n='N060'/>(1957); N.J. Stat. Ann. § 2A: 78-4 (1957). In
				<lb facs='#facs_116_r_1_1_tl_61' n='N061'/>many cases it may be appropriate to move for
				<lb facs='#facs_116_r_1_1_tl_62' n='N062'/>an expanded voir dire. This motion can als
				<lb facs='#facs_116_r_1_1_tl_63' n='N063'/>serve to educate the judge about the issues
				<lb facs='#facs_116_r_1_1_tl_64' n='N064'/>underlying the homicide, since their complexity
				<lb facs='#facs_116_r_1_1_tl_65' n='N065'/>is a reason why voir dire must be expanded
				<lb facs='#facs_116_r_1_1_tl_66' n='N066'/>An excellent work in the area of voir dire and

				<lb facs='#facs_116_r_1_1_tl_82' n='N082'/>produced valuable interchanges between defense

				<lb facs='#facs_116_r_2_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>103. This composition was the result of severa
				<lb facs='#facs_116_r_2_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>factors. Primary among them was the fact that

				<lb facs='#facs_116_r_2_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>of justice which will provide an opportunity to

				<lb facs='#facs_116_r_2_1_tl_48' n='N048'/>since the prosecution's theory was that Garcia's

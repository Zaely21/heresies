               <p> It was a time when women were flowers, and flowers, that is, flowers painted
                  themselves, and they smelled good and talked a special language. Flowers and women
                  were equal under sexist law. Women and flowers and paintings of flowers—so
                  intererchangeable and interrelated. But no one has yet spoken of flower
                  liberation. </p>

               <p> &quot;One of the most delightful accomplishments that can be chosen for the fair
                  sex is that of catching the transieut shades of beauty which are found upon
                  flowers, and fixing them on paper. The able pencil shows to us the queen of spring
                  with her spherical form, her delicate colours, the beautiful green of her foliage,
                  the thorns which protect her, the dew-drops which bathe her, and the butterfly
                  which skims lightly over her beautiful form.&quot; –Mrs. Frances S. Osgood,

               <p> &quot;Goethe&apos;s Urpflanze* was not a sexist concept.&quot; —Anonymous
                  *Goethe&apos;s Urpflanze was a &quot;primal-plant&quot; or archetype that he
                  conceived, inspired by a sixteenth-century palm he encountered in Padua&apos;s
                  botanical garden. </p>

               <p> &quot;.. another flower, the human sister of those vegetable ones, as deautiful
                  as they, more beautiful than the richest of them,... still to be touched only with
                  a glove, and not to be approached without a mask.&quot; —Nathaniel Hawthorne,
                  &quot;Rappaccini’s Daughter,&quot; 1844 </p>

               <p> O’Keeffe on O’Keeffe: &quot;When you took time to really ntoice my flower you
                  hung all your own associations with flowers on flower and you write about my
                  flower as if I think and see what you think and see of the flower and I
                  don&apos;t.&quot; </p>

            <div>
               <p> “All flowers have a uniform function, the reproduction of the species through the
                  production of seed.... Stamens and pistils are not present together in all
                  flowers. When both are present, the flower is said to be perfect or bisexual. All
                  complete flowers are obriously also perfect. When only one kind of essential organ
                  is present, the flower is termed imperfect, or unisexual.... When the same plant
                  bears unisexual flowers of both sexes, it is said to be monoecious: when the male
                  and female flowers are on different plants, the plant is dioecious.... When there
                  are male, female and bisexual flowers on the same plant, the plant is termed
                  polygamous.&quot; —Encyclopedia Britannica, I967 </p>
            </div>
            <div>
               <p> &quot;Sensitive Plant... Chastity &quot;This singular plant is so named from its
                  motions imitating the sensibility of  animal life. It contracts itself in the
                  evening and expands with the morning light, and shrinks from external violence,
                  folding up its leaves at the mere approach of one’s hand. The Violet is the emblem
                  of that retiring modesty which proceeds from reflection, but the Sensitive Plant
                  is a perfect image of innocence and virgin modesty, the result of instinct.&quot;

               <p> The exhibiition records of the later nineteenth century list literally hundreds
                  of women practitioners of still-life painting, and particularly of flower
                  painting; it would be meaningless to mention them all, especially since
                  practically nothing is known about most of them ... A mysterious Miss L. Whitcomb
                  was mentioned in the late 1870&apos;s as the finest lady flower painter in the
                  country.&quot; Gerdts and Burke, American still-Life Painting, I971 </p>

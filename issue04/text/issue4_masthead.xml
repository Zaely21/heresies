               <p>The Editorial Group of Heresies 4 will hold an open meeting on Wednesday,
                  April 26, 8 P.M., at the women’s Coffee House, 54 7th Avenue South, New York
                  City.</p>

               <p> HERESIES is an idea-oriented journal devoted to the examination of art and
                  polities from aennnist perspective. We believe that what is commonly called
                  art can have aBolitical derpact, and that in the making of art and of all
                  cultural artifices our identities as women play a distinct role. We hope
                  thateziÈs will.stim éloque arouud radical political. and aesthetie theory,
                  ancourage the writing of the taistory of femina sapiens, and generate new
                  creative daergies among women. It will be a place where diversity can be
                  articulated. We are committed to the broadening of the definition and
                  function of art.</p>
               <p>HERESIES is structure as a collective of feminists, some of whom are also
                  socialiste, marxists, les deinists or anarchists; our fields include
                  lainting, sculpture, writing,ifropology, literature, performance, art
                  history, arbitecture and filmmaking. Wille the themselves of the individual
                  issues will be determined by the collective, each issue will have a
                  different editorial staff made up of women who want to work on that issue as
                  well as members of the collective. Proposals for issues may be conceived and
                  presented to theHERESIES Collective by groups of women not associated with
                  the collective. Each issue will take a different usual form, chosen by the
                  group responsible. HERESIES will try to be accountable to and in touch with
                  the international 18ministselmunity. An open evolution meeting will be held
                  after the appurance of each issue. Topics for issues will be advanced well
                  in advance in order to collect material from many sources. Possibly
                  satellite pamphlets and broadsides will be produced containing the
                  discussion of each central theme. In additionHERESIES provideing for people
                  who work editorially, in design and in production, both on-the-job and
                  through workshops. As part of its commitment to the public HERESIES houses
                  andebaintains the women Artists’ Slide Registry</p>
               <p>As women, we are aware that historically the connections between our lives,
                  our arts and our ideas have been supposed. One these connoctions are
                  clarified they can function as a means to dissolve the alienation between
                  artist and audience, and to understand the relationship between art and
                  polities, work and workers. As a step toward a demystification of art, we
                  reject the standard relationship of Iricism to art within the present
                  system, which has often become the relationship of advertiser to product. We
                  will not Cdvertise a new set of genus-products just because they are made by
                  women. We are not committed to any particular style of aesthetic, nor to the
                  competitive mentality that per vades the art world. Our view of feminism is
                  one of process and change, and we feel that in the process of this dialecte
                  we can foster a change in the meaning of art</p>

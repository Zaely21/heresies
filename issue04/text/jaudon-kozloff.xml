            <p>
               As feminists and artists exploring the decorative in our own paintings, we were curious about the pe-
               jorative use of the word "decorative” in the contemporary art world. In rereading the basic texts of
               Modern Art, we came to realize that the prejudice against the decorative has a long history and is based on
               hierarchies: fine art above decorative art, Western art above non-Western art, men’s art above women’
               art. By focusing on these hierarchies we discovered a disturbing belief system based on the moral super
               iority of the art of Western civilization.</p>
               <p>We decided to write a piece about how language has been used to communicate this moral superiority
               Certain words have been handed down unexamined from one generation to the next. We needed to take
               these words away from the art context to examine and decode them. They have colored our own history
               our art training. We have had to rethink the underlying assumptions of our education.</p>
               <p>Within the discipline of art history, the following words are continuously used to characterize what has
               been called "high art”: man, mankind, the individual man, individuality, humans, humanity, the human
               figure, humanism, civilization, culture, the Greeks, the Romans, the English, Christianity, spirituality,
               transcendence, religion, nature, true form, science, logic, purity, evolution, revolution, progress, truth,
               freedom, creativity, action, war, virility, violence, brutality, dynamism, power and greatness.</p>
               <p>In the same texts other words are used repeatedly in connection with so-called "low art”: Africans,
               Orientals, Persians, Slovaks, peasants, the lower classes, women, children, savages, pagans, sensuality,
               pleasure, decadence, chaos, anarchy, impotence, exotica, eroticism, artifice, tattoos, cosmetics, ornament,
               decoration, carpets, weaving, patterns, domesticity, wallpaper, fabrics and furniture.</p>
               <p>All of these words appear in the quotations found throughout this piece. The quotations are from the
               writings and statements of artists, art critics and art historians. We do not pretend to neutrality and do not
               supply the historical context for the quotations. These can be found in the existing histories of Modern Art.
               Our analysis is based on a personal, contemporary perspective.</p>

               <head>WAR AND VIRILITY</head>
               <p>Manifestoes of Modern Art often exhort artists to make violent, brutal
               work, and it is no accident that men
               such as Hirsh, Rivera, and Picasso like
               to think of their art as a metaphorical
               weapon. One of the longstanding targets of this weapon has been the decorative. The scorn for decoration 
               epitomizes the machismo expressed by Le
               Corbusier, Gabol Pevsner and Marinetti/Sant’Elia. Their belligerence may
               take the form of an appeal to the machine aesthetic: the machine is idolized
               as a tool and symbol of progress, and
               technological progress is equated with
               reductivist, streamlined art. The instinct to purify exalts an order which is
               never described and condemns a chaos
               which is never explained.</p>

               <head>PURITY</head>
               <p>In the polemics of Modern Art, purity represents the highest good. The
               more the elements of the work of art are
               pared down, reduced, the more visible
               the purity. Here Greenberg equates
               reductivism with rationality and function. But it is never explained why or
               for whom art has to be functional, nor
               why reductivism is rational. Among
               artists as diverse as Sullivan, Ozenfant
               and de Kooning, we found the sexual
               metaphor of "stripping down art and
               architecture to make them nude or
               pure. The assumption is that the artist is male, and the work of art (object)
               female.</p>
               
               <p>Clement Greenberg, <ref>"Detached Ob, 1976</ref>:
               <quote>"The ultimate use of art is construed
               as being to provide the experience of
               aesthetic value, therefore art is to be
               stripped down towards this end.
               Hence, modernist functionalism,
               essentialism’ it could be called, the
               urge to purify’ the medium, any
               medium. Purity’ being construed as
               the most efficacious, efficient,
               economical employment of the me-
               dium for purposes of aesthetic
               value."</quote></p>
            
               <p>Louis Sullivan, <ref>"Ornament in Architecture, 1892</ref>:
               <quote>"... it would be greatly for our aesthetic good, if we should refrain
               from the use of ornament for a period of years, in order that our
               thought might concentrate acutely
               upon the production of buildings
               well formed and comely in the
               nude."</quote></p>

               naked body moves us by the harmony of its form."</quote></p>
            
               <p>Willem de Kooning, <ref>"What Abstract
               Art Means to Me," 1951</ref>:
               <quote>"One of the most striking of abstract
               art’s appearance is her nakedness,
               an art stripped bare."</quote></p>

               <head>PURITY IN ART AS A HOLY CAUSE</head>
               <p>Purity can also be sanctified as an aesthetic principle. Modern artists and
               their espousers sometimes sound like
               the new crusaders, declaring eternal or
               religious values. A favorite theme is
               that of cleansing art. The ecclesiastical
               metaphor of transcendence through
               purification (baptism) is used to uphold
               the "Greek tradition (as in the van de
               Velde quotation) or the "Christian
               tradition (as in the Loos quotation).
               Cleansing and purification are sometimes paired with an exalted view of the
               artistas a god, as in Apollinaire s' desire
               to "deify personality.</p>

               1903</ref>:
               <quote>"As soon as the work of cleansing
               and sweeping out has been finished
               as soon as the true form of things
               comes to light again, then strive with
               all the patience, all the spirit and the
               logic of the Greeks for the perfection of this form."</quote></p>

               art there are racist assumptions that devalue the arts of other cultures. The ancient Greeks are upheld as the model,
               an Aryan ideal of order. Art in the
               Greco-Roman tradition is believed to
               represent superior values. Malraux
               uses the word "barbarian and Fry the
               word savages to describe art and art
               ists outside our tradition. The non-Western ideals of pleasure, meditation
               and loss of self are clearly not understood by the exponents of ego assertion,
               transcendence and dynamism.</p>

               <head>FEAR OF RACIAL CONTAMINATION, IMPOTENCE AND DECADENCE</head>
               <p>Racism is the other side of the coin of
               Exotica. Often underlying a fascination
               with the Orient, Indians, Africans and
               primitives is an urgent unspoken fear of
               infiltration, decadence and domination
               by the mongrels gathering impatiently at the gates of civilization. Ornamental objects from other cultures which
               appeared in Europe in the nineteenth
               century were clearly superior to Western machine-made products. How
               could the West maintain its notion of
               racial supremacy in the face of these
               objects? Loos’s answer: by declaring
               that ornament itself was savage. Artists
               and aesthetes who would succumb to
               decorative impulses were considered
               impotent and/or decadent.</p>

               <quote>"I have made the following discovery and I pass it on to the world: The
               evolution of culture is synonymous
               with the removal of ornament from
               utilitarian objects. I believed that
               with this discovery I was bringing
               joy to the world; it has not thanked
               me. People were sad and hung their
               heads. What depressed them was the
               realization that they could produce
               no new ornaments. Are we alone, the
               people of the nineteenth century,
               supposed to be unable to do what
               any Negro, all the races and periods
               before us have been able to do?
               What mankind created without ornament in earlier millenia was
               thrown away without a thought and
               abandoned to destruction. We possess no joiner’s benches from the
               Carolingian era, but every trifle that
               displays the least ornament has been
               collected and cleaned and palatial
               buildings have been erected to house
               it. Then people walked sadly about

               <p>Racist and sexist attitudes characterize
               the same mentality. They sometimes
               appear in the same passage and are
               unconsciously paired, as when Read
               equates tattoos and cosmetics. The tattoo refers to strange, threatening customs of far-off places and mysterious
               people. Cosmetics, a form of self-ornamentation, is equated with self-objectification and inferiority (Schapiro). Ra-
               cism and sexism ward off the potential
               power and vitality of the other.

               <head>THAT OLD CHESTNUT. "HUMANISM"</head>
               <p>Humanism was once a radical doctrine
               opposing the authority of the church,
               but in our secular society it has come to
               defend the traditional idea of mankind” and status quo attitudes. The
               human values such authorities demand of art depend on the use of particular subject matter or particular
               ideas of "human expression. Without
               humanist content, ornament, pattern
               and ritual or decorative elaborations of
               production are condemned as inhuman, alien and empty. "The limits of
               the decorative, says Malraux, can be
               precisely defined only in an age of humanistic art.” We could rather say that            
               the generalities of "humanist” sentiment characterize only a small part of
               world art, most of which is non-Western and decorative. But why should
               anyone prefer the false divisions of
               these writers, based on ethnic stereotypes, to a historical awareness of the
               interdependence of all "human cultures?</p>

               <p>The antithesis of the violence and des-
               truction idolized by Modern Art is the
               visual enhancement of the domestic environment. (If humanism is equated
               with dynamism, the decorative is seen
               to be synonymous with the static). One
               method "modernism has used to dis-
               credit its opponents has been to associate their work with carpets and wall-
               paper. Lacking engagement with
               human form or the real world,” the
               work of art must be stigmatized as decorative (Sedlmayr and Barnes/de Mazia). So decorative art is a code term signifying failed humanism. Artists such
               as Gleizes and Kandinsky, anxious to
               escape the tag of the decorative, connect their work to older, humanist
               aspirations.</p>

               <head>AUTOCRACY</head>
               <p>Certain modern artists express the desire for unlimited personal power. The
               aesthetics of modernism—its egomania, violence, purity-fixation and
               denial of all other routes to the truth—is
               highly authoritarian. The reductivist
               ideology suggests an inevitable,
               evolutionary survival of the (aesthetic)
               fittest. Reinhardt declares throughout
               his writings that all the world’s art must
               culminate in his pure paintings. Ozenfant equates purism with a superstate. Mendelsohn believes the advocates of the new art have a right to
               exercise control.</p>

               We started by examining a specific attitude—the prejudice against the decorative in art—and found ourselves in a
               labyrinth of myth and mystification.
               By taking these quotes out of context
               we are not trying to hold these artists
               and writers up to ridicule. However, to
               continue reading them in an unquestioning spirit perpetuates their biases.
               The language of their statements is often dated—indeed, some of them are
               over a century old—but the sentiments
               they express still guide contemporary
               theory in art.</p>
               <p>Modernism, the theory of Modern
               Art, claimed to break with Renaissance
               humanism. Yet both doctrines glorify
               the individual genius as the bearer of
               creativity. It seems worth noting thai
               such heroic genius has always appeared
               in the form of a white Western male
               We, as artists, cannot solve these problems, but by speaking plainly we hope
               to reveal the inconsistencies in assumptions that too often have been accepted
               as "truth.</p>

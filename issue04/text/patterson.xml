            <p> The island women love to talk but they seldom talk in aesthetic terms about the
               houses which are their medi- um and arena for a lifetime. They talk maliciously,
               sentimentally, tartly, and vividly about people, animals, crops, and weather, things
               that move and change. “Hasn’t he a God-forsaken ap- pearance?”“Nothing for it now but
               to put the thought of the evil day on the “You have two firm little long finger.
               ankle bones that’Il walk you there and back again.” Animated and daring while
               describing any event, living in- tensely inside their all-purpose kitchen, the
               chameleon like hub of Aran life, which changes constantly with each chore, meal and
               ceremony, Kate Con- neeley and Nan Mullin treat their kitchens like their worn
               clothes, as things to be taken for granted. But the two crafts executed by Aran
               women, interior design and knitting, are decidedly legitimate art forms, each with
               its aesthetic devices, which could not have been developed anywhere ex- cept on this
               slab of rock twelve miles out in the Atlantic.</p>
            <p>The Aran house, thatched or slate roofed, stands straight up on top of sheets of dark
               gray limestone with nothing, no flower borders or architec- tural fancies, to soften
               the abruptness of its construction. Inside it is mostly a kitchen with some adjunct
               rooms on the side for sleeping and storage. This ver- satile kitchen exists in marked
               contrast to the raw, for the most part untouched rock and soil outside. Within is a
               world of absorbing chores, but there is noth- ing at all cozy or domestic about the
               awesome views through the windows or open door in Aran. It’s customary in this windy
               place to leave one of the two facing kitchen doors open all day for light. Shifts in
               the wind dictate which of the two it’s to be. A glance outside Nan Mullin’s
               east-facing kitchen door reveals the mountainous Connemara coast, a vaulting sky with
               a drama of gargantuan clouds. If a strong wind came against it, this door would be
               shut fast, its west-facing twin would be opened, and all the daily traffic habits
               would be reversed. The cliff-side view is almost Martian in its desolate, ter- raced
               expanse of limestone walls, cheered only by “those cheeky devils, the foraging
               chickens in Nan s yard.</p>
            <p>The less affluent houses on the re- mote wester tip of Inishmore (largest of the
               three islands that sit at the mouth of Galway Bay on the Atlantic coast of Ireland)
               are structurally simple and straightforward with little if any mold- ing or refined
               carpentry. The rooms have thick plaster or mud-covered walls, which are divided into
               upper and lower halves of differing colors by a border, a strip of patterned paper.
               One of the visual pleasures of these kitchens lies in the eccentric deployment of er-
               ratic quantities of paint. A dish cabinet or a door is painted from the same can of
               bright enameled paint as a small frame around a religious picture. The paint used to
               define a three-dimension- al object may show up as a flat band around a deep-silled
               window. The movement of the colors—heavy and bright worked against luminous white-
               wash—compensates for the minimal skills in carpentry and masonry. The unpredictable
               color patches create a liveliness and variety in a house made up of white and two
               colors. But what colors! A kelly green and a chrome yel- low, used in equal amounts.
               This kin- etic, frugal paint scheme keeps the eye moving. When a paint can is opened,
               any object that looks woebegone re- ceives a fresh coat. It’s an anarchistic way to
               paint. Shelves made of card- board receive the same irreverent, care- free enameling
               used on a door. The general effect is that paint equals fresh- ening.</p>
            <p>An Aran woman with her two cans of paint and whitewash brush would not <pb

               items she uses to dec orate her home are 80-cent purchases: plaster statuettes of the
               Virgin Mary or quickly put together cardboard shelves. nothing to compare with the
               hand painted wonders of the Pennsylvania Dutch. But the placement of these
               store-bought objects throughout the room is witty and innately elegant. Rooms
               dominated by a vivacity of lan guage and dramatic physical gestures pick up sparkle
               from the stray spots of decoration, the luminous white walls, and the vivid shifting
               of wall levels. Ex- cept for the religious items, everything in the room is intensely
               handled: buck- ets, kettles and dishes. There is a nat- ural flow between room decor
               and peo- ple. Objects with multiple uses seem fit- ting for a talkative people with a
               variety of skills. The stove is used for warming the room, washing and drying
               clothes, and cooking.</p>
            <p>The Aran people either emigrate or stay put—nothing else. Life is con- trolled by
               specific facts of nature and history. The lack of trees, the phenom- enal wind and
               rain, and the astonishing contiguity of the swarming, changeful life in the homes
               exist side by side with the somber Celtic and Christian debris (prehistoric forts,
               beehive dwellings of the saints, and Celtic crosses). Every- thing goes on within a
               cultural-psychic frame. Just as life is lived within rigor- ous structures—of a
               subsistence econo- my, Catholicism, no big city distrac- tions, no birth control, no
               divorce—the frames are the motif everywhere. It is an island framed by water, framed
               by the Gaelic language; the mantel frames the coal stove or the hearth and is itself
               framed by a march of mementos and photos across its top.</p>
            <p>Not even Mondrian lived more with- in rectilinear plasticity than the woman who
               boils, bakes, mends, churns. washes, sweeps, skims and spiffs up her gridded
               workroom. The frame is used mostly as a definer, signifying “this is a door, this is
               the cupboard, setting off religious chromos with an inexpensive wooden frame. The
               placements, choice of objects, designing of the frame never seem off-handed, although
               the spatial judgements are never as precise as those made by the Shakers. Much of the
               architectural play is achieved by hanging frames at various levels, set- ting up a
               rhythm of unpredictable un- ions and divisions. There are three basic conventions for
               hanging pictures. The first is to hang the largest, always Jesus or Mary, about six
               inches from the ceiling, its top edge angled out from the wall. The second is to
               arrange groups in relation to the patterned di- vider which circles the room. The
               third convention relates objects to the doors and windows. A framed prayer, sus-
               pended by a string smack in the center above the door, does double duty, blessing the
               house and welcoming the visitor. None of the objects is placed only for decorative
               effect: these pres- ences are like protectors spotted around .. . or connections.
               They create a stage set of cultural locators, defining the family’s world as
               Catholic, Republic of Ireland, Gaelic-speaking, and their lin- eage as either Hernon,
               O’Brian or Con- cannon.</p>
            <p>The most baroque object in any kit- chen is the dish cabinet with virtually every
               piece of dishware owned by the family on display, exposed and handy A flood of
               plates, mugs, jugs, saucers. cups (either plain white or bearing stripes or floral
               patterns), in an inordin- ate number of layerings, stackings, hanging spots and
               pattern changes. The mantelpiece is runner-up for most objects per square foot.
               Statues of the Virgin Mary, the Infant of Prague, small porcelain roosters, windup
               clock, battery-run radio, official portraiture: John F. Kennedy, Padriac Pearse (the
               Irish nationalist and poet), at least one pope, Pius, John or Paul, or St. Martin de
               Porres, a black saint who is a pop- ular favorite all over Ireland.</p>
            <p>The baroque condition of the mantel top and dish cabinet emphasizes the tendency of
               Aran rooms to throw all items into sculptural relief. The small- est item, a minute
               frame with a baby photo, a tiny white plastic statue of Mary, are tactically
               transformed by framing, color and placement, so that each item is emphatically
               present, a strongly defined object. The foot-and- a-half thick walls contribute a
               massive- ness that is echoed by other hard-edge devices, the space divisions created
               by the borders are made more dramatic by the interplay of the cool luminous whitewash
               and the glossiness and hard insistence of the thick, brilliant, full- strength
               enamel.</p>
            <pb

            <p> Some of the most enticing designs oc- cur along the room’s equator, an inch-
               and-a-half wall divider, a strip of paper with a flower pattern. Teasingly de- ployed
               with themselves and with the border are a potpourri of small articles: ceramic
               mementos, calendars, post cards, sentimental homilies and illus- trated prayers. A
               souvenir plate just nudges the edge of a door frame, while its other side touches a
               prayer card which sits an inch above the patterned divider. These small gifts work as
               touchstones to the culture, but their minute echoing and alteration, one against the
               other, is endlessly enticing to the mind and eye.</p>
            <p>While the Aran women may take their work as interior decorators for granted, they are
               proud, byedad!, of their sweaters and well aware of the art involved in making them.
               Sculptural (with a surface level varying as much as an inch), monochromatic and
               tight-fit- ting, these encrusted sweaters are meant to be worn in a harsh climate.
               Textures are coarse like the fissured and gashed surface of the island. Made of wool
               from which the natural oil has not been removed they’re close to waterproof. They are
               so tight that they have buttons at the neck so that the head can get comfortably
               through. The close fit cuts down the possibilities of entanglement and interference,
               allow- ing it to be easily worn under a worker’s jacket.</p>
            <p>The patterns are arranged into clear representations of the island’s physical
               terrain, with its staggering number of stone walls enclosing myriad tiny fields. The
               trellis, zigzag and diamond pat- terns crisscross the sweaters as walls <caption>

               diamonds enclosing a field of seed stitches with a bobble inside each of the diamond
               points, every diamond framed on its side by a band of cable stitches.</p>
            <p>The sweaters are always a single col- or, usually a dark tweedy gray, indigo black or
               subtle browns with moss green or maroon casts to them. They possess an intriguing
               tone . . . nutty colors, like dark cinnamon or the shells of Brazil nuts. The women
               dress against the dourness of the island in bright primary colors, floral-print
               cottons and plaids; the men wear the colors of the land- scape, brindled gray pants
               and sweat- ers, dark browns and dark blues, which harmonize with the stone walls, the
               fields, the sweep of limestone.</p>
            <p>The names of the stitches and pat- terns refer to the trade of the men who originally
               wore them: the cable, rope. ladder stitch, the herring bone, triple sea wave, lobster
               claw, fish tail. These explicit names are different from the lyrical ones still used
               in Scotland, such as Sacred Heart, the Rose of Sharon, Star of Hope, Crown of Glory.
               But the Aran fisherman’s sweater has its own biblical stitch, the Tree of Life. Orig
               inally, the sweaters were made by fish- ermen, a rather natural step from mak- ing
               and mending nets, weaving ropes and making knots. Now, and for an un- determined
               length of time, the women have taken over.</p>
            <p>One of the finest knitters is Una Fla- herty, a Bohemian spirit, her clothes held on
               by safety pins, who runs the shop in Bongowla, the last village on the western tip of
               the island. In be- tween chasing chickens out of the open door, receiving a new
               shipment of goods from Galway with high-spirited witticisms and sarcastically getting
               tea for her husband Patrick, she knits. She has an energetic way with her works in
               progress, dragging them along the floor after her as she goes in search of a can of
               peas or couple of candles for a cus- tomer. An entertaining talker, she knits swiftly
               while carried away with her stories and suddenly throws her work to the floor to
               emphasize a point. Una s sweaters are exceptionally rich with in- terlaced designs,
               reminiscent of the pat- terning on Celtic stones and crosses.</p>
            <p>Mary Flaherty, mother of nine, knits with amazing speed even while walking down the
               road with three of her young- est clutching at her skirts. Garrulous and
               multicrafted, these animated wom- en live within a contradiction of clutter and
               simple geometry. In the rooms, the two most common design elements- frames and
               conscriptive devices which force the framed items into assemblies. groups—give the
               sense of rootedness, enclosure, a life of clear limits, a grounded life with few
               choices. Yet there are in both the sweater and kitch- en design, contrary effects of
               intense, crowded together activity: the wildest puckishness within an economic pin-
               point.</p>
            <p>Kate Conneely’s kitchen was often transformed by a heady stream of lan- guage from
               Kate herself, her children and her cranky, bragging 87-year-old mother. A battery of
               kettles and pots were kept on the stove at all times. Shoe repairing, baking, butter
               churning. clothes washing, butchering, saddle mending, knitting. Often such
               activities required furniture to be shifted about and the room to take on an entirely
               dif ferent character. A heavy clothes wash- ing called for the table and chairs to be
               moved out of the way, a massive amount of hot water boiled on the stove, the big tin
               tub moved in from the fields, sleeves to be rolled up and the floor to be doused with
               sudsy water. The long wall in the back of the house would be decked with clean wet
               sheets, shirts, underwear, trousers, pinafores, and these would have rocks placed on
               top of them so that the newly washed clothes would not blow away.</p>
            <p>Two ancient grandmothers are sta- tioned statuelike, in territorial posses- sion of
               their spot in front of the fire, The population here, which includes animals welcome
               (dogs) and unwel- come (cats and chickens), is trans- formed during special
               occasions: dances with four accordionists, four or five singers taking turns between
               jigs, horn- pikes, waltzes and polkas. During wakes, the corpse is laid out in the
               side bedroom and the kitchen is filled with people all night long.</p>
            <p>Given the generations, needs, events of an Aran home, art is indeed not a central
               fact. As 1 was leaving, Kate said: “Patricia, it’s a pity you re leav- ing now,
               because one of those two old ladies at the stove will be going soon. We’ll have a
               great night here, that time. The two old women were nod- ding in agreement: “Yes,
               it’s a pity."</p>
            <p>Life’s conditions in the awesome stoneyard of Aran don’t leave any ap- parent space
               for the visual arts. Yet, the cheapest item, as well as the most honored elder, gains
               presence” by the way the women decorate the kitchens and design their sweaters. The
               intense, rectilinear use of space creates a fun, a garrulity, that is not unlike the
               famous Island talk. Wherever the eye lands, there is an elaborate fooling with decor-
               ation, intentional or otherwise.</p>

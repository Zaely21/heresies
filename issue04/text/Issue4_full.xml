               HERESIES 4
               OPEN MEETING
               The Editorial Group of Heresies 4 will
               hold an open meeting on Wednesday,
               April 26, 8 P.M., at the Women’s
               Coffee House, 54 7th Avenue South,
               New York City.</p>
            <p>
               HERESIES is an idea-oriented journal devoted to the examination of art and politics from a feminist perspective. We believe that what
               is commonly called art can have a political impact, and that in the making of art and of all cultural artifacts our identities as women play a
               distinct role. We hope that HERESIES will stimulate dialogue around radical political and aesthetic theory, encourage the writing of the
               history of femina sapiens, and generate new creative energies among women. It will be a place where diversity can be articulated. We are com-
               mitted to the broadening of the definition and function of art.
               HERESIES is structured as a collective of feminists, some of whom are also socialists, marxists, lesbian feminists or anarchists; oun
               fields include painting, sculpture, writing, anthropology, literature, performance, art history, architecture and filmmaking. While the themes
               of the individual issues will be determined by the collective, each issue will have a different editorial staff made up of women who want to work
               on that issue as well as members of the collective. Proposals for issues may be conceived and presented to the HERESIES Collective by
               groups of women not associated with the collective. Each issue will take a different visual form, chosen by the group responsible. HERE-
               SIES will try to be accountable to and in touch with the international feminist community. An open evaluation meeting will be held after the
               appearance of each issue. Topics for issues will be announced well in advance in order to collect material from many sources. Possibly satellite
               pamphlets and broadsides will be produced continuing the discussion of each central theme. In addition HERESIES provides training for
               people who work editorially, in design and in production, both on-the-job and through workshops. As part of its commitment to the public
               HERESIES houses and maintains the Women Artists’ Slide Registry.
               As women, we are aware that historically the connections between our lives, our arts and our ideas have been suppressed. Once these con
               nections are clarified they can function as a means to dissolve the alienation between artist and audience, and to understand the relationship
               between art and politics, work and workers. As a step toward a demystification of art, we reject the standard relationship of criticism to art
               within the present system, which has often become the relationship of advertiser to product. We will not advertise a new set of genius-products
               just because they are made by women. We are not committed to any particular style of aesthetic, nor to the competitive mentality that per
               vades the art world. Our view of feminism is one of process and change, and we feel that in the process of this dialogue we can foster a change
               in the meaning of art

               This woman is making pottery in Chiapas, Mexico. The techniques for coiling and shap-
               ing a single lump of clay predate the Spanish Conquest of the sixteenth century; the wares of
               women of Chiapas and of the state of Oaxaca to the north are famous throughout Mexico for
               their utility and distinctive style.
               Assertive and confident, articulate and skilled, the traditional potters in Oaxaca and
               Chiapas bear little resemblance to the Mediterranean idea of women widely held in Mex-
               ico—as passive and acquiescent. The potters pass on manufacturing and decorating tech-
               niques to younger women who are apprenticed at about six or seven years.
               Recent studies of Mayan art and numerous Aztec figurines and stone sculptures (includ-
               ing the monumental and monstrous Coatlicue, Mother of the Gods, now in the Mexican Na-
               tional Museum) show that women occupied
               a prominent place in Indian society and
               thought, not only as wives and mothers but as goddesses, politicians and priestesses. A deg-
               radation of the role of women was one consequence of the Spanish Conquest. Traditional
               potters in Mexico reflect this past prominence: they demonstrate their skill and author-
               ity over the clay that has made their pottery famous, though they themselves remain
               anonymous.

               From the Editorial Group
               </p>
            <p>
               Women’s Traditional Arts? Initially we met anticipating discussions of quilts, pottery and weaving rugs. But discussions of quillwork.
               poetry and weaving narratives came up too. It became clear that basic to our concerns was the politics of aesthetics. And in these dis-
               cussions we couldn’t examine either the artifacts or their politics without a constant awareness that our process was collective. We
               found that collectivity and deadlines make strange bedpersons. Like any revolution, any revelation, collectivity was the best of times, it was the
               worst of times.
               As a self-selected group of women we all shared a commitment to our topic and a commitment to the Heresies Collective, the 21 women who
               are the magazine’s originators and publishers. Nearly half the editorial group which produced this issue are Heresies Collective members too.
               The others of us responded to the Heresies invitation which offers feminists the space and the means to explore and analyze women’s issues in
               depth. Our editorial responsibility ranged from discussing issues, soliciting articles, reading and responding to submissions and working
               editorially with writers, to the technical production of the magazine. This lengthy process required willingness to put aside learned notions of
               efficiency. Criticism and self-criticism were the feedback structures that allowed us continually to re-examine our process and our ideas. We
               had to respond to different levels of experience and tried to avoid their expression in conscious or unconscious hierarchies
               Our concern about structure had its emotional edge. We began as eleven. We are now nine. Our fledgling process was as full of pain and
               anxiety as it was of intelligence and optimism. We needed to weigh the comparative values of professional writing versus amateur investigation
               and set our own standards which emphasized the communication of issues rather than just cherished notions of good writing. Each editor had a
               sense of an insider/outsider tension. On the one hand, there was an unspoken set of assumptions shared by some members of the group,
               vocabulary and gestures which grew out of a common history, a common consciousness. On the other, there was a fear that this set of assump
               tions implied a clique.
               What kind of process did we create? We felt we were constantly tripping over ourselves. We were frustrated and embarrassed at all the
               doubling
               back and overlap in our discussions, especially when we were met with questions like, “If she’s a pain in the ass, why don’t you kick
               “Why do you waste so much time with democracy?”“Hierarchies are inevitable. Why don’t you face it?”“Isn’t a collective a came
               her out?
               designed by a committee?” What we created was awkward, was exhilarating. As involved as we all were with making the magazine beautiful.
               exciting, intellectually stimulating, this became secondary to the problem of how we could possibly accommodate ourselves to each other’s
               needs as creative women.
               How could we collectively make a magazine that represented us all? How comfortable were we with each other’s voices, with each other’s
               images, with each other’s ideas? We did not want this issue to be an organ for self-promotion. But fired by our discussions and prompted by
               questions raised in submitted articles, many members of the editorial group submitted articles for publication. Analogies were made to
               archeological digs and contemporary anthropology, and the more excited we were by the information of our contributors, the more immed-
               iately we wanted to participate ourselves.
               The Women’s Movement is in a new phase. Consciousness-raising continues to be basic to any feminist enterprise. We are shifting the arena
               of our political activity from the private to the public. In projects like Heresies this shift takes the concrete form of a magazine, the creation of a
               forum, the extension of ideas and images into places where they can be discussed and critiqued. This development requires a scrutiny which at
               times seems inimical to the support and solidarity that are the goals of consciousness-raising. But to resort pessimistically to the conclusion that
               deadlines demand bureaucracies is to overlook that we are still developing the sort of consciousness and fantasy that can project alternatives.
               A dialectic of content and process evolved in the production of this issue. Every positive aspect had its negative underbelly, and vice versa.
               Our understanding of women’s traditional arts expanded in response to the material submitted to us, and there were recurring motifs: time.
               efficiency and domesticity. Recognizing that time was a common denominator all women shared—time for one woman might mean cooking.
               for another weaving, for us, producing this issue—we began to realize the positive aspect of our flexibility in handling time (we were certainly
               not behaving “efficiently”), but we were simultaneously aware that the model for this attitude to time came from the family where the woman’s
               work is never done and always done and where the endlessness of tasks is depleting and domesticating. From her house flows much of the ar
               that this issue considers.
               In order to understand women’s traditional arts and our responses to it we had to deconstruct and reconstruct to be able to see clearly the
               interrelationships between art objects and the conditions in which they are produced. This cycle of dismantling and re-creating characterized
               our own creative process too. The boundaries women have worked within and challenged were familiar to us. Traditionally, women’s working
               spaces have been defined by their tent, hut or home, their psychological spaces by the rhythm of domestic demands. We often become attached
               to our working and psychological spaces to the extent that our process disintegrated when we moved from place to place and phase to phase.
               Confronted with women’s traditional arts, our loyalties were torn; we wanted at the same time to celebrate and lament. Trying to reconstruct
               a part of the history of women’s artmaking obliged us to tolerate these contradictions, to negate, affirm and transcend simultaneously what ha-
               characterized women’s work. In this way, re-evaluation of the past and how it impinges on the present does not necessitate a fresh start, but a
               self-reflective critical appropriation of a past which, though created by the “anonymous toil” of unknown women, belongs to all of us
               Language conveys attitudes and feelings and at the same time reflects and constructs consciousness. We were sensitive to the need for
               scrutinizing our words when we spoke together, for questioning clichés. Elements of a new vocabulary emerged in our discussions, a
               vocabulary which helped us view women’s traditional arts in the ways we have.
               “Filters” are the biases we bring to our projects. By acknowledging them, we wanted to challenge the myth of objectivity, to let our various
               feminist partisanships show. “Femmage” is the practice of collecting, recycling, reshaping and juxtaposing the artifacts of everyday life, a
               mode echoed in our production of this magazine. “Anonymous toil” is the labor that invisibly supports the honored products of culture.
               “Matronizing” attitudes are characterized by a smug feminism that knows the answers and ceases to be self-critical. Because we were dealing
               anthropologically with other cultures and editorially with other writers, we found ourselves fighting against falling into this stance.
               The entire process—from initial meetings to eventual publication—took nine months. Obviously a full-term pregnancy. The toughest part
               was to achieve the fine balance between the sentimental and the intellectual
               Initially, our aim was to investigate women’s traditional arts. This led us to another question: what will women of the future make and what
               will their contexts be? We are at a peculiar and exciting edge: one foot in the socially stratified past, the other in our utopian fantasy of the
               future.</p>

               What do we mean by the traditional
               arts of women? All too often we are
               talking about activities that are not
               considered art either by the women who
               perform the tasks or by the societies in
               which they live. Some peoples do not
               conceptualize transforming mere cul-
               tural' activities into the domain of art
               When the category does exist, women
               rarely emerge as the great artists. Com-
               ing from a society where art is recog-
               nized, valued and produced almost en-
               tirely by men, it is not surprising that</p>

               American feminists are interested in
               looking at the relationship women have
               to art in other cultures, to see if the
               comparison sheds additional light on
               the American condition. Before enter-
               ing into such a discussion with material
               from Mexico, however, we should pro-

               tween the so-called fine arts and the
               traditional or folk. The nature of fine
               arts is individualistic, that of the folk,
               collective. The fine arts represent the
               work of specialists, recognized person-
               alities who dedicate themselves almost
               exclusively to their art. Even when they
               supplement their incomes with addi-
               tional jobs, the culture sees them as art-
               ists first. The folk arts, on the contrary
               are the work of nonspecialists,
               unknown people who are, perhaps,
               farmers, fishermen, miners, individuals
               who make modest livings in old-fash-
               ioned” ways and happen to produce
               folk art on the side. What is more, ac-
               cording to cultural definitions, folk art-
               ists do not create so much as carry on
               timeless traditions. They are living
               vestiges of the past and the more ob-
               scure they are, the more authentic they
               appear.
               In a culture where progress, special-
               ization and rugged individualism are
               valued, why have we created and main-
               tained such a static category as the tra-
               ditional arts? We could argue that the
               anonymity and timelessness imposed
               on folk art permit those who practice
               the fine arts to borrow freely from tra-
               ditional motifs. Who would accuse a
               Bartók of plagiarism just because he
               used Hungarian peasant melodies?
               Less cynically, but troubling all the
               same, we might suggest that the alien-
               ation of our lives in modern America
               has awakened in many a yearning for
               simpler times and forms. Yet in order
               to have the “folk, a group of people
               must preserve for us the ways of the
               past—in the hills of Appalachia, in the
               African bush or in mud huts in Mexico.
               Feminists today are well acquainted
               with the cultural strategy that keeps
               folk artists in the obscurity of their
               grass-roots authenticity, for women
               have been erased in similar ways. Like
               the folk artist, woman is by definition a
               nonspecialist and a carrier of tradi-
               tions. She is first and foremost a wife-
               mother whose social and economic
               duties prevent her from having the time
               to specialize. Then, even if class
               privilege gives her the option to refuse
               her sex s destiny, she still has to fight
               the culture s traditional view that her
               creative powers are limited by her
               biology.
               Our culture has so successfully con-
               fined the arts to the male sphere that it
               has developed sex-specific vocabularies
               to distinguish work done by men (spe-
               cialized) from that done by women
               (generalized). Thus, although tasks tra-
               ditionally assigned to women usually
               fall outside the arts entirely, a number
               of skills become lesser arts when per-</p>
            <p>
               formed by male specialists. Women, for
               example, do sewing and cooking. Men
               are couturiérs or chefs. Careful to mark
               the status relationships, we borrow
               terms from the lofty French to describe
               the specialized work of a man, leaving
               the lower-class Anglo-Saxon to identify
               the chores that fragment a woman's
               day. Of course there are female coutur-
               ieres and chefs, and the numbers are
               undoubtedly growing as women today
               succeed in becoming professionals in
               these and other fields. Yet recent
               changes do not negate the long cultural
               history of the sexes in American society
               in which men (at least of certain
               classes) have been encouraged to spe
               cialize, while women (despite their
               class) have almost always been less rig-
               orously trained, at best educated to
               dabble in a few areas, but by and large
               inadequately prepared for anything
               other than, perhaps, wifing and
               mothering.
               While feminist artists continue their
               struggle to change cultural definitions
               and thereby gain entry into the male-
               dominated world of the fine arts, some
               are also trying to open the Academy to
               work usually associated with the “in-
               ferior” crafts or simply with the domain
               of women s work. In the process, they
               have been collecting the nearly forgot-
               ten traditions of women in rural Amer-
               ica and abroad, creating a specifically
               female folk culture by bringing to light
               previously unrecognized skills of
               unknown women who never had the
               chance to specialize. Given feminist
               consciousness, we can hope that those
               who produce the recently recognized
               art will emerge from obscurity as indi-
               viduals, instead of being reduced to the
               collective anonymity so characteristic-
               ally the fate of traditional artists. Still,
               lingering questions must be raised, for
               it is not entirely clear that we see what
               our interest in folk art may mean for
               those women who happen to be carry-
               ing on our timeless, authentic female
               culture.
               Other political movements have her-
               alded the art of the folk while fighting
               to end their oppression—i.e., the Nar-
               odniks in czarist Russia, intellectuals in
               the Mexican and Irish revolutions,
               leaders of Black and Native American
               Power movements—and it might be
               useful to analyze their histories careful-
               ly. As a start, let us look at postrevo-
               lutionary Mexico, where we shall see
               how the enthusiasm expressed by urban
               political leaders for traditional culture
               has been a mixed blessing, particularly
               for those who have been living the im-
               poverished reality which seems to pre-
               serve folk art the best. Specifically we</p>

               shall see how Indian women from
               Hueyapan, a highland village in the
               state of Morelos, have been encouraged
               to maintain their so-called Indian
               culture—in essence their lower socioec-
               onomic status—by a nation whose
               revolutionary ideals call for the pres-
               ervation of Mexico s indigenous herit-
               age.
               RRRRRE,
               A Mexican Indian Example
               Looking at the traditional culture of
               Hueyapan is like looking into a reser-
               voir of oppression. It is a mixture of
               cultural hand-me-downs from the rul-
               ing class, combined with a few vestiges
               from pre-Hispanic times that have
               managed to survive over 400 years of
               Spanish/Hispanic occupation. We
               find, for example, under the rubric of
               indigenous culture, sixteenth-century
               Spanish colonial dress, medieval
               miracle plays, and renaissance double-
               reeded instruments played only to
               celebrate Catholic fiesta days. As for
               those customs which are truly of pre-
               Hispanic origin, they have been
               transformed almost beyond recognition
               to conform to the dictates of Hispanic
               cultural rules. What is more, these
               modified indigenous forms frequently
               exist only because they have become
               part of the dominant culture as well.
               After the Revolution of 1910-1920,
               the Mexican government began active-
               ly to preserve and reinforce so-called in-
               digenous customs. For ideological pur-
               poses, political leaders wanted to
               glorify the country’s unique heritage,
               partly Spanish, partly Indian. Artists
               painted, choreographed and wrote
               about Indians, while philosophers phil-
               osophized about them. Archeologists,
               sculptors and architects labored to
               restore and celebrate pre-Hispanic cul-
               ture. Folk arts began to flourish. So
               successful was this cultural renaissance
               that by the 1950s tourists were flocking
               to Mexico to visit museums and pre-
               Hispanic ruins, to purchase inexpen-
               sive traditional art objects and to travel
               into the interior to see how the Indians
               lived in their natural habitats.
               In the eyes of many Hueyapeños,
               this glorification of Mexico’s roots'
               can do little more than reinforce their
               oppression. Living in a community
               where the socioeconomic realities of
               their traditional culture prohibit them
               from enjoying the conveniences of
               modern Mexico, they claim that the on-
               ly viable future for the villagers lies in
               losing their Indian identity. Many of
               the young people, particularly women,
               are not waiting for changes to take
               place in Hueyapan and have migrated
               instead to Mexico City and Cuerna-</p>

               vaca. As far as they are concerned, it is
               better to work long hours as maids in
               comfortable homes, or live in the urban
               slums, than to remain in Hueyapan and
               continue their tedious—albeit “folklor-
               ic —Indian existence.
               That more women than men want to
               leave Hueyapan is directly related to
               the distribution of so-called traditional
               culture in the village. In a society where
               to be traditional or indigenous still
               brings both low social status and hard
               work, the world of Hueyapan women is
               decidedly more Indian than that of its
               men. What is true here simply supports
               what anthropologists writing about
               modernization have found elsewhere:
               almost always men assimilate more
               quickly in Third World countries, for
               capitalist and socialist systems in-
               tegrate them more rapidly into urban
               and rural work forces. Women who do
               not become maids in the cities are often
               isolated at home where they provide
               unpaid labor by taking care of their
               husbands and reproducing new work-
               ers, remaining, as a result, more con-
               servative culturally. Even in places
               where men no longer practice tra-
               ditional customs, women often con-
               tinue to do so, speaking the local
               language among themselves, dressing
               in the old way and continuing to work
               with little help from labor-saving tech-
               nology.? As any Hueyapan woman will
               explain, women who stay in the village
               are the last to change.
               The Mexican government has fur-
               ther contributed to the division between
               the modernizing man and the tradi-
               tional woman by its interest in pro-
               moting indigenous culture. On the one
               hand, it has provided more training
               and technology to change the nature of
               men s work than women s. On the
               other hand, it has encouraged women
               more than men to develop their tradi-
               tional skills. In Hueyapan, for instance,
               where weaving still exists, government
               programs have tried to interest local
               women in making shawls, ponchos and
               scarves for the tourist trade. What is
               more, when government represen-
               tatives come to the village on official
               visits—an event that happens several
               times a year—they appreciate it if the
               Hueyapeños welcome them with an
               ethnic reception. Thus, in the name of
               paying homage to Mexico’s indigenous
               heritage, young girls are dressed up in
               the so-called Indian costume” native to
               the area and receive the honored guests
               with flowers and little speeches in
               Nahuatl.“ Furthermore, women pre-
               pare a mole meal, the traditional fiesta
               dish, for these government repre-
               sentatives.</p>
            <p>
               To move to a more specific analysis,
               we could look at almost any one of the
               so-called indigenous traditions found in
               Hueyapan today to illustrate in con-
               crete terms how the villagers’ culture
               reflects their long history of being
               dominated by a non-Indian society. Al-
               though industrialization has hardly
               brought liberation, it is still a fact that
               the poorest rural communities through-
               out Mexico are generally the most “In-
               dian. What is more, as these villages
               begin to change, traditional culture
               holds on the longest among the most
               oppressed inhabitants, particularly the
               women, who for social, economic and
               cultural reasons remain more isolated
               from the influences of modernization.
               Given that Mexico is interested in both
               industrializing the country and preserv-
               ing its so-called indigenous heritage, we
               could suggest that one resolution of the
               problem has been to “develop one sex
               and sustain the past with the other.
               Drawing on traditional Hispanic
               definitions of sex roles and status dif-
               ferentiations between men and women,
               the choice was easily made. For pur
               poses of this discussion, then, let us
               turn to traditional cooking to see what
               the preservation of this “folk art has
               meant in the daily lives of Hueyapan
               women.
               RPRRRRRRRRPRRRRRPRRFRRRET
               The Art of Cooking
               “The
               In a recent article entitled
               Magic of Mexican Food North of the
               Border, Craig Claiborne whimsically
               begins:
               For some confounding reason known
               only to a few Aztec gods, the authentic
               flavors of the Mexican kitchen, like cer-
               tain fine wines and some exotic plants,
               do not travel well. They transport poor-
               ly through some curious dilution of
               tastes, some diminution of savor, some
               evanescence of essences [New York
               Times, September 21, 1977].
               Could Claiborne have written this if
               he had tasted Mexican food prepared in
               an indigenous peasant village? His call-
               ing forth of mystery, humor and ro-
               mance inadequately describes what one
               experiences in today’s closest equiva-
               lent to an Aztec kitchen. There, it is
               true, the ingredients are very fresh and
               the food has that special aroma of the
               open hearth, but it also has been
               ground first, for tedious hours, on
               special volcanic stones (metates) that
               are generations old, and cooked in
               earthenware pots seasoned by years of
               use. There is no secret why Mexican
               food does not travel; it cannot even be
               re-created properly in Mexico City,
               much less New York. What we lack are
               the necessary rustic working condi-</p>
            <p>
               tions and equipment.
               While members of the privileged
               classes, particularly from abroad, have
               come to appreciate Mexican cooking as
               one of the world’s great cuisines, for
               Hueyapeños it remains one of the end-
               less chores that women must attend to
               in the course of a day’s work. As far as
               many villagers are concerned, the food
               they eat and the process involved in its
               preparation are merely additional indi-
               cations of their inferior status. If they
               had the means, therefore, they would
               stop eating like Indians and would eat
               as they think the rich do, buying food
               in tin cans and cellophane packages
               which they—or preferably a maid
               -would heat quickly over a gas stove.
               Although most Hueyapeños recognize
               that certain foods, tortillas for example,
               taste better when prepared at home, the
               labor entailed is enormous, encourag-
               ing the women, more than the men, to
               seek ways of simplifying the work.
               In almost every home in Hueyapan,
               the basic daily diet consists of tortillas
               and boiled beans served with chile pep-
               pers, sometimes in a sauce, sometimes
               just off the vine.» At every meal, even
               among the poorest, one is sure to have
               these staple foods and then, depending
               on the family’s income, the productiv-
               ity of the barnyard, fields and or-
               chards, other dishes may be added. At
               breakfast and supper—the latter being
               a very light meal with perhaps only one
               tortilla wrapped around a few beans-
               weak and highly sweetened coffee or
               herbal tea is served, substituted on rare
               occasions by hot chocolate. Coffee, like
               chocolate, is expensive and must be
               purchased, while most of the teas are
               grown locally. Sweet rolls (pan dulce)
               baked in the village and bought at near-
               by stores are also frequently served at
               breakfast or dinner, particularly to
               children.
               If the family can afford it, women
               usually prepare additional dishes for
               the main meal at midday. Lunch spe-
               cialties may be nothing more elaborate
               than one of several kinds of chile
               sauces, beans prepared with the flavor-
               ful ayocote flower or fried in a bit of
               lard. But on market day, a piece of beef
               or pork may also be added (one kilo for
               about 14 people), boiled with season-
               ings and served in its broth. Beef may
               be cooked in a beef mole soup in-
               stead. When meat is unavailable or too
               expensive, noodle soup, prepared with
               pork fat, or pork rind fried in a soupy,
               green chile sauce provide substitutes.
               Although chickens and turkeys are
               fiesta foods only, eggs fried in pork fat
               and a chile sauce may also appear, per-
               haps once a week, in the diet of families</p>
            
            <pb facs="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BucknellDSC/heresies/main/issue04/images/Heresies_04_009.jpg" n="9" xml:id="img_0009"/>
            <p>
               who raise laying hens or have enough
               money to purchase eggs at the store
               (four or five eggs would serve 14 peo-
               ple). Another popular dish, when they
               pear
               are in season, is stewed prickly
               cactus shoots (nopalitos). Finally, after
               fiestas, the leftover mole sauce (see
               below) is used to make enchiladas and
               chilaquiles.
               Women prepare the most elaborate
               meals on fiesta days. Traditionally
               Hueyapeños celebrate at least ten
               village-wide Catholic fiestas as well as
               the individual saint days of members of
               the family. Since the Mexican Revolu-
               tion, about five national holidays have
               been added. All celebrations, be they
               religious or secular, village-wide or
               family, are feted by serving a tradi-
               tional menu. Although Hueyapeños
               share responsibilities by sponsoring one
               fiesta or another in a given year, at
               which time they have open house, most
               families who can manage to—and most
               sacrifice so that they can—still cele-
               brate at home as well, at least for the
               most important fiestas. Relatives, com-
               padres and comadres (individuals with
               whom the family has a formal ritual
               relationship blessed by the Church),
               and political friends, visit one another
               at these times, eating the same tradi-
               tional dishes at each home.
               For birthdays and other family-
               based holidays, there is a special break-
               fast of atole and meat tamales as well as
               the elaborate midday meal. Meat tam-
               ales take hours to prepare and must be
               made the night before by a team of
               women—usually the mother-in-law,
               the wife, perhaps a teenage daughter
               still living at home and a comadre or
               two (in particular widows with no fam-
               ily left in the village who have time to
               help on such occasions). Since the work
               goes on late into the night, only to begin
               again before dawn the next day, the in-
               vited assistants do not bother to go
               home, but wrap themselves up in
               blankets they bring along with them
               and curl up on straw mats placed on the
               dirt floor in the kitchen. Thus, by the
               time the male family members and a
               few guests—mostly men as well—are
               enjoying a tamale-atole breakfast, the
               women have long been at work, some
               looking after the hot atole corn meal
               drink and others attending to the main
               meal of the day, butchering turkeys or
               chickens, cooking the soup, the rice,
               the mole colorado,e the bean and plain
               tamales, the boiled beans and the
               countless tortillas.
               Fiestas, it is true, give women the
               chance to cook, eat and drink together,
               certainly providing some relief from
               their normal routines. Still, the work is</p>
            <p>
               exhausting and may go on for several
               days, rarely letting up enough for
               women to have a chance to leave the
               kitchen and enjoy the dancing or other
               party activities. What is more, once the
               holiday is over, women, particularly
               mothers with young children, are faced
               once again with their strenuous daily
               schedules.
               Mexican cooking is difficult and
               time-consuming under traditional
               conditions mainly because almost every
               ingredient must be ground finely by
               hand—from the corn used in tortillas
               tamales and atole, to every spice and
               vegetable added to a mole or chile
               sauce. The work is back-breaking, even
               for women used to it, and must be per-
               formed kneeling before the large grind-
               ing stone (metate), a kitchen utensil
               known pre-Hispanically throughout
               America.
               Since the 1950s Hueyapan has act-
               ually had a number of corn mills, elim-
               inating the need to grind corn by hand.
               According to the women, however,
               many men initially objected to the
               mills. Not only did they complain
               about the cost (two cents a bucket), but
               they did not like the texture of mill-
               ground tortillas. Corn ground on the
               metates simply tasted better. Another
               innovation which met with a mixed re-
               action was the tortilla press, used to
               shape tortillas that traditionally are
               fashioned between a woman’s hands in-
               to paper-thin disks.
               Despite the new improvements, the
               work of “throwing tortillas remains
               endless, for a family of 14 eats well over
               50 at one meal and expects them fresh
               and hot off the griddle at least twice a
               day. What women really need to
               simplify their work is a tortilla factory,
               where hot tortillas can be purchased
               before each meal. While many non-
               Indian communities surrounding the
               village have such tortillerías, there is no
               talk as yet of introducing one into
               Hueyapan.
               Given the argument developed so far
               we can now conclude with a few re-
               cipes, letting the descriptions of the
               preparations and the ingredients speak
               for themselves. No attempt will be
               made here to help the reader reproduce
               these dishes in a modern kitchen, nor
               will proportions be systematically pro-
               vided. Traditional Mexican cooking, at
               least in Hueyapan, has been a matter of
               availability of resources: what has been
               harvested, what the family can afford
               to buy, how many people must be fed
               with a small fixed budget. One chicken,
               for example, can easily serve 20 people.
               When the soup gets low, one just adds
               more water and another leaf of pepper-</p>

               There are no exact amounts of
               this’s and that’s and it would therefore
               be an arbitrary exercise to suggest that
               there were.
               What can be discussed is the labor
               involved in preparing a particular dish
               and whether the ingredients are grown
               locally or must be purchased. Further-
               more we can note the origins of the in-
               gredients at the time of conquest to aid
               us in identifying the influences Hispan-
               ic tastes have had on so-called indigen-
               ous food.
               It will become immediately evident
               that fiesta food, more than the basic
               staples, shows considerable Iberian/
               Old World influence. This is hardly
               surprising when we remember that all
               aspects of the Indians ritual life be-
               came the solemn responsibility of the
               Catholic missionaries who settled in in-
               digenous towns during the early colon-
               ial period, converting the people and
               transforming their culture. Hueyapan
               was conquered in 1524, only three years
               after the Aztec Empire fell. By the
               1530s Augustinian missionaries had
               come to the area and by 1561 the Do-
               minicans had already built a church,
               monastery and several chapels in the
               pueblo (Martinez-Marin, 1968, p. 64ff).</p>

               After the corn has been harvested and dried, women re-
               move the kernels from the cob and store them in enormous
               sacks, weighing about 100 pounds each. Daily about ten liter
               measures of dry corn (for a family of 14) have to be boiled
               with a fistful of lime and a bit of salt. Originally the corn was
               boiled in large earthenware jars (ollas) but today it is more
               frequently boiled in tin cans. It takes several hours for the
               corn to soften to the right texture
               The corn cools, and then a standard-size bucket of kernels
               is ground for the breakfast tortillas. Before “throwing tor-
               tillas, however, the corn meal must be kneaded to the proper
               consistency. Often water is added. Little round balls of the
               moist meal (masa) are shaped into thin round tortillas and
               toasted over the hearth on a clay disc that has been washed
               down with lime. Successful tortillas are thin and inflate just a
               bit while cooking. They should be served hot off the fire and
               are preferably prepared throughout the meal by a female
               member of the family who eats later. The tortilla is not only a
               food, but is also used as an eating utensil, a scoop for beans
               and other food.</p>

               The dried kidney or ayocote beans are boiled with the above

               ayocote.

               It should be noted that although the wealthier Aztecs ate
               wild boar (peccary) (Soustelle, 1961, p. 151), the pork eaten
               in the village seems to come out of Spanish culinary practices.

               Corn meal is stirred into heating water and milk, making a
               thick but drinkable porridge. This mixture is flavored with
               ground chocolate, cinnamon or the whole kernels of corn and
               then heavily sweetened. It is cooked in an olla and served
               hot.
               It should be noted that although chocolate is indigenous to
               Mexico, it comes from the tropical lowlands and was prob-
               ably not used by the highland Morelos Indians pre-
               Hispanically.</p>

               The pork is cubed and fried with the red guajillo chile
               which has been softened in boiling water and ground on the
               metate. Before making the tamales, the corn meal is kneaded
               to the proper consistency. Then, taking a bit of corn meal the
               size of a meatball and stuffing it with the meat and chile mix-
               ture, the tamale is wrapped carefully in a corn husk, assum-
               ing the shape of a small corn cob. Finally it is placed in a
               huge olla where perhaps 200 similar tamales are huddled to-
               gether and steamed for a couple of hours. The olla must be
               sealed closed with totomoscle bush leaves—huge, flat and

               The corn meal is kneaded to the proper consistency. Salt
               and water are added. The boiled ayocote beans (see above)
               must be ground on the metate. Some of the corn meal is then
               spread over the surface of the metate which in turn is covered
               by a layer of ground beans and another layer of corn meal.
               The “marble corn is fashioned into tamales, again in the
               shape of small corn cobs, wrapped in corn husks and steam-
               ed in a huge olla that has been covered with totomoscle
               leaves.
               A plain tamale, made only of corn meal, is prepared in the
               same way. It is flat, however, not round, and serves as a
               scoop for food much like a tortilla.</p>

               The chiles and green tomatoes are peeled and ground on
               the metate. The squash seeds are very finely ground. These
               three ingredients, seasoned with salt, are fried in lard. Soup
               and epazote leaves are added and the mixture simmers for
               about an hour.
               The sauce is served over chicken or pork. Although it
               should be reasonably thick and have a nutty taste, the sauce
               should also have a fine texture. Tamales (bean and plain) are

               T’o make enough mole to serve with one hen (to feed about
               20 people), Hueyapan women usually use ¼ kilo of pasilla
               chile, ¼ kilo sesame seeds and as much as they care to or can
               afford of the other ingredients—usually small quantities.
               All the spices, including the onions, bread and tortillas
               have to be ground very finely. The pasilla chile (a dark red,
               flat pepper) is purchased dry and soaked first in boiling
               water. The ground ingredients are then sautéed in lard and
               finally the soup is added. The mixture simmers for about an
               hour and is then served over chicken or turkey. Bean and
               plain tamales as well as fresh tortillas are served along with</p>
            <p>
               it. Boiled beans follow as the last course.
               Mole colorado is the most important fiesta food in the vil-
               lage. Keeping in mind what we have already said about the
               way Spanish priests probably influenced fiesta cooking, it is
               particularly interesting to see what happened to the pre-
               Hispanic mole.
               According to Soustelle, in The Daily Life of the Aztecs,
               this dish originally was nothing more than a chile stew
               (Soustelle, 1962, p. 27). After the conquest, however, mole
               came to resemble an East Indian curry. Thus not only did
               Spaniards call the inhabitants of Mexico Indian, but they
               also altered one of the most common Aztec recipes to support
               this error of ethnic identity.
               A standard curry has the following ingredients: coriander,
               cumin, turmeric, nutmeg, cloves, red pepper, onions, rais-
               ins, almonds, walnuts, cashew nuts, coconut, white poppy
               seeds and yogurt.
               When I talk about culture and cultural activities, I am using the
               terms in the anthropological sense. I am not referring to CUL
               TURE as it has been developed in Western society. Following T
               Parsons, C. Geertz, and D. Schneider, by culture I mean a sys-
               tem of symbols shared by a group of people (D. Schneider, 1968,
               p. 1).
               2 This argument has been particularly well developed by Ester
               Boserup, 1970
               3 The clothing traditionally worn by the women conforms to the
               dictates of Carlos V, who during the early part of the colonial
               period sent formal orders to Mexico that Indians had to dress ac
               cording to Spanish styles and an Iberian sense of decency.
               (Foster, 1960, pp. 101-102).
               4 Nahuatl was the language of the Aztecs and is still spoken in
               Hueyapan—in a form strongly influenced by the Spanish—by the
               old, particularly the women. To this day, the villagers believe
               what they were told in colonial times, that Nahuatl is not a lan-
               guage, but only a dialect, which has no grammar or literature.
               5 Descriptions of the ingredients and preparation of most of the
               dishes mentioned can be found in the recipe section at the end of
               this article. My information comes from experiences cooking with
               women in Hueyapan during fiestas in 1969-70 and on subsequent
               visits in 1971, 1973, 1974, 1975, 1976 as well as daily exposure
               during the same time in the home of Doña Zeferina Barreto,
               where she and her daughter-in-law cooked for 14 people.
               6 For less formal affairs, the preferred mole colorado may be substi-
               tuted by one of the less complicated green moles, like the pum-
               pkin seed mole listed in the recipe section.
               Pigs, like steer, are slaughtered in the village by the Hueyapan
               butcher. With the exception of chickens and turkeys, few families
               butcher their own animals, but sell them alive and purchase back
               a small quantity of meat.

               Is There a Feminine Aesthetic?
               Silvia Bovenschen</p>
            <p>
               This article was first published in German in Aesthetik und Kommunika-
               tion, No. 25, September 1976. We are reprinting excerpts from the article
               translated into English by Beth Weckmueller and originally published in

               Old and new appraisals of women’s artistic production
               The time has come for a campaign against all the weeping and
               wailing. Even the media have got the hang of it—with their usual
               inconsequence. Women are oppressed, exploited, degraded. ...
               Although this state of affairs has hardly changed since it was first
               articulated, to continue to proclaim it now in the artistic realm
               seems almost pointless. But this need not necessarily be the case.
               As can be seen on closer examination, it is the tone of the lament
               that makes it seem inadequate. The form the lament takes still
               acknowledges its addressee. Traditionally it was women—profes-
               sional mourners—who rendered grief public, be it in regard to
               death, to suffering or to the victims of massacres; this was one of
               their rare opportunities to assume a public function. But precisely
               for this reason it was not at all startling, indeed, no one particu-
               larly noticed, when women began publicizing and decrying their
               own lot, that of their sisters, their female ancestors and, should
               women’s fate not improve, the lot of future women. Clearly,
               Cassandra was not a false prophet. She was simply not heard. No
               one paid attention to her.
               For this reason I thought it tedious to enumerate once again the
               entire battery of obstacles constructed to frighten off and exclude
               women from the artistic realm. Yet the handicaps and the
               absences are also part of women’s history, and perhaps even the
               greater part, since women did not clomp through history in com-
               bat boots, and their traces are fleeting and obscured. To be sure,
               we do not complain as much today because we have a movement
               making demands that will change the future. Nevertheless, in
               respect to the question of a “feminine aesthetic,” we need to re-
               examine its traditional assessments once again, if only for the
               reason that we lack a viable conceptual basis to work from.
               Repeatedly and rightfully women have bemoaned the
               deformations of even their own cultural taste”: “I would . . . far
               sooner have been caught dead with Hemingway than with Virginia
               Woolf in my hands,”1 says Shulamith Firestone about her
               development. The pursuit of art, often based on the search for a
               realm of sensitivity in hopes of thereby escaping the confines of the
               home, may become a trap for women just as easily as other pur-
               suits. When discussing that which we associate with patriarchal
               structures in the cultural realm, we immediately take note of a
               scandalous situation which, along with many others, was un-
               covered long ago but still prevails. Just to refresh our memory.
               Simone de Beauvoir established long ago that men mistake their
               descriptive perspective for absolute truth. The scandalous situa-
               tion, then, is: the equation of truth with the masculine perspective,
               that is, with everything observed, examined and portrayed from a
               male point of view, which we were made to adopt very early in life.
               This false equation not only predominated in the production and
               reception of art. It also guaranteed that, despite our fervent
               endeavor, this sphere remained external, foreign and remote. This
               was but one reason for our exclusion among the many overt and
               lucid strategies employed by men to repress us when they found
               that our perceptive powers had not been sufficiently blunted.
               George Sand, Histoire de ma Vie:?
               Mr. de Keraty followed me into the anteroom in order to
               debate with me, at yet greater length, his theory concerning
               the intellectual inferiority of women. It would be impossible
               for even the most intelligent woman to write a good work.
               And as I wanted to leave then, he ended his speech with a
               Napoleonic stroke, which was to shatter me. “Believe me,” he
               said in a weighty tone, as I was about to open the last door of
               his sanctuary, “bring children into the world instead of</p>
            <p>
               books!” “My dear,” I answered, thinking
               Iwould choke on
               my laughter and slamming the door shut in his face, “follow
               your advice yourself, as well as you can!
               The classic notions about women’s artistic competence are all
               too familiar. Though she is the great theme of art, woman as em-
               pirical being is acceptable only by virtue of her supposed inspir-
               ational powers. “In an Amazon society there could be neither
               culture nor history nor art, since art is not essential to woman.”3
               We know today, though only because we bothered to look into the
               matter ourselves, that it is not difficult to prove that such state-
               ments are historically incorrect. They show (and help justify) that
               the masculine realm of artistic production, and often the artistic
               products themselves, are not only inaccessible to women, but are
               also fundamentally foreign to us.
               Critics have always regarded the female producers of literature,
               art and music, few and far between as they are, as exotic aber-
               rations. From a purely quantitative point of view, this indeed was
               and still is the case, although we have yet to rediscover the many
               women artists who were consciously forgotten.
               To be sure, women’s representation in the arts is a rarity. And
               even this rarity is always measured in terms of production norms
               within the established framework defining the division of artistic
               labor, a framework which does not encompass forms of social
               creativity. And when a few works do manage to find their way to
               the public despite all obstacles placed in their path, they tend to be
               viewed in the following manner: Though women may have ac-
               complished some rather nice and enjoyable things now and then,
               all the major innovative achievements have nonetheless remained
               the exclusive territory of the great masters of the pen, the brush or
               the keyboard. (Thus any mounting anxiety can be quickly and
               easily quelled.
               But now there is a threat from the other front: the theoretician
               of equality. Today the line of argument emphasizing equality
               belongs to the repertoire of the man who moves in “progressive
               circles. He says that since they can no longer be kept completely
               ignorant, women should at least turn out to be what men already
               are. One need only open the floodgates, and women will stream in-
               to the spheres dominated by men. But what if we no longer view
               the difference as deficiency, loss, self-effacement and deprivation,
               but rather as opportunity? Around the turn of the century, the
               statement “We women can do just as much as men” served as a
               beckoning light. Today it is no longer so terribly impressive. Of
               course we could do just as much. The question is, do we want to do
               just as much as men, or the same thing as men? Here we have
               come full circle. So it would seem.
               Chantal Akerman, Interview in Frauen und Film (Women
               and Film):
               If women imitate men’s battles they will become weaker and
               weaker. They must find new forms of struggle. This became
               evident in Hendave where women demonstrated against the
               death sentence in Spain. Some women shouted and clenched
               their fists, while others just hummed. They went “mmmm-
               mmm” with their lips pressed together, and moved forward
               in a row. That is a new way of demonstrating which can be a
               hundred times stronger than fists. We have had a virtual in-
               flation of shouting with raised fists, and I, for one, simply
               walk by when I hear it. In film and in the arts we must also
               find a language which is appropriate to us, one which is
               neither black nor white.
               Art has been primarily produced by men. Men have dominated
               the neatly segregated public sector that controls it, and men have
               defined the normative standards for evaluation. Moreover, insofar
               as they came into contact with this sector at all, women have for
               the most part acquiesced to its value system. These realizations led
               Firestone to the conclusion that “It would take a denial of all
               cultural tradition for women to produce even a true ’female’ art.
               Such a statement is easily made. Indeed, aesthetic norms and
               cultural standards have meaning only in their sublation. But those
               standards and those norms were not even our own. What is the
               ground that we are working? From where does a “feminine” art
               get its identity? Or does it not need to do that? Is art, then, still art</p>

               in the traditional sense, no matter how far it has gone to the dogs?
               Is “feminine a criterion of substance, an ontological entity?
               Let us then radically negate all the masculine cultural achieve-
               ments and begin anew at the point where we once left off, tilling
               the soil as our female ancestors did before the great male putsch.
               That is not very funny, even as a powder room joke. Perhaps we
               would enjoy that—linking ourselves directly to bygone power, but
               we should be wary of construing a direct connection where none
               exists. Making such a connection can raise false hopes of finding
               help.
               Call as often as we might to the old mother goddesses—Aphro-
               dite, Demeter, Diana and all the rest of those Amazons of long lost
               female empires—their power cannot reach this far, for their em-
               pires have been extinguished. Only the important consciousness
               that things were once different eases our burden a bit. To be sure,
               it is very important that we reappropriate moments of female
               potential from past cultures which have been silenced in organized
               fashion by male history. And the work to be done in this area is im-
               mense. (I emphasize this to avoid any misunderstanding.) But any
               attempt to link them directly to our experiences in the twentieth
               century will be unsuccessful. And if we nonetheless force a direct
               connection, the results will be downright pitiful. We will be left
               with parsley as a method of inducing abortion, and here and there
               a herbal home remedy.
               The desire to tailor a positive (female) counterpart to the world
               that was constructed and interpreted by men is not satisfied in this
               manner. Let us rather quote the women of the past as we wish,
               without being pressured into retroactively fabricating continuity
               On the other hand, though, a historical archeology in search of
               women past and forgotten, their obscured activities, living condi-
               tions and forms of resistance, is not just nostalgia. The hidden
               story of women, which reveals itself to us as primarily one of suf-
               fering and subjugation (now here is continuity!), is the dark side of
               cultural history—or better: the dark side of its idealized version
               Women artists waft through history as mere shadows, separated
               from each other. Since their deeds remained for the most part
               without effect and their creations were, with rare exception, ab-
               sorbed into the masculine tradition, it is not possible to retro-
               spectively construct an independent countertradition. Only female
               martyrs are not in short supply. All of this would certainly seem to
               be grounds enough for avoiding even the most trifling involvement
               with the problems of art and cultural history.
               But the Great Refusal is not the solution either. To believe that
               feminine spontaneity need be creative in every case is to fail to
               recognize the powerful effect that cultural and historical deforma-
               tion also had on the subjectivity of women, as mentioned by
               Firestone. Can women just “be women, reduced to some elemen-
               tal Being? We are in a terrible bind. How do we speak? In what
               categories do we think? Is even logic a bit of virile trickery? Or to
               put it even more heretically, how do we feel?? Are our desires and
               notions of happiness so far removed from cultural traditions and
               models? Feminism cannot ultimately imply that we are to stop
               thinking, feeling, longing. No one ever claimed that. On the con-
               trary, we are consciously just beginning to do these things. No
               doubt, we have always done these things differently than men.
               (We are dealing with a sort of double exposure here.) But the
               means of expression most readily available to us for communica-
               ting our perceptions, our thought processes—language, forms, im
               ages—are for the most part not originally our own, not of our own
               choosing. Here we are still at the beginning. Sensitivity to the
               patriarchal structures common to language usage° is certainly a
               step in this direction.
               Lucy Lippard: “Why a separate women’s art?””
               What seems to be most important in this whole matter is that
               we focus our eyes and our feelings upon the flashes of insight
               which our feminine sensitivity affords us.
               Frieda Grafe, in Filmkritik:
               Language, the medium of my work, is for me already so
               generalized and mute that I cannot strive for even further
               generalities. Instead, I direct all my energies toward making
               the wall of generalities so thin that something will be able to</p>
            <p>
               come from within
               break through the barrier, something can
               my body and enter the overarticulated linguistic sphere. I
               want to show the generative base of language before it
               atrophies in communicable form.
               We ought to rid ourselves of the notion of a historically ever-
               present female counterculture. And yet, on the other hand, the
               very different way in which women experience things, their very
               different experiences themselves, enable us to anticipate different
               imaginations and means of expression.
               No matter which tack I take, I am left with the frustrations and
               difficulties inherent in positive definitions.
               The pre-aesthetic realms
               Even in the past, 1 contend, the exclusion of women from the ar-
               tistic realm could not extinguish all their aesthetic needs. These
               creative impulses, however, were shunted off into the “pre-
               aesthetic realms, where they evaporated under the strain of
               women’s daily routine. Women furnished the living quarters, set
               the tables, arranged, decorated and adorned their clothing and
               above all themselves.
               That was allowed, as long as it was being done to please the
               man. These activities quickly corrupted women. They set the table
               for the man, they dressed and adorned themselves for the
               man—not for themselves or for each other, but rather in compe-
               tition with each other. They busied themselves weaving and knit-
               ting, but such functional artworks, handicrafts and decorations
               have always been considered inferior, commonplace. This verdict
               is of course not entirely unfair, especially in those cases where even
               these most timid efforts were channeled into subservient obsequi-
               ousness and excessive affection-seeking.
               Sylvia Plath, in The Bell Jar:
               Once when I visited Buddy I found Mrs. Willard braiding a
               rug out of strips of wool from Mr. Willard’s old suits. She’d
               spent a week on that rug, and 1 had admired the tweedy
               browns and greens and blues patterning the braid, but after
               Mrs. Willard was through, instead of hanging the rug on the
               wall the way I would have done, she put it down in place oj
               her kitchen mat, and in a few days it was soiled and dull and
               indistinguishable from any mat you could buy for under a
               dollar in the Five and Ten.
               Here the ambivalence once again: on the one hand we see
               aesthetic activity deformed, atrophied, but on the other we find,
               even within this restricted scope, socially creative impulses which.
               however, have no outlet for aesthetic development, no oppor
               tunities for growth.
               It is true that these activities never had to become static, un-
               changing artistic norms. They never became obsolete products;
               they remained bound to everyday life, feeble attempts to make this
               sphere more aesthetically pleasing. But the price for this was nar-
               rowmindedness. The object could never leave the realm in which it
               came into being, it remained tied to the household, it could never
               break loose and initiate communication.
               But what would happen if someday we cleared out this realm
               and opened it only to ourselves and other women? What if we
               alternated painting our faces with painting on canvas? What if we
               turned recipes into poetry? What if all these activities were to shed
               their utilitarian rationale of male approval?

               Fetched forth again the largeness appears,
               tucks bear witness: from the beginning.
               Grown thinner, experience more fragmented
               The smooth stitches turn into difficult cable,
               Growing upward, lending strength.

               There was hardly enough wool.
               13/9/76
               Perhaps that is all too simple, too superficial. Attempting to knit
               the gap between the artistic realm and social reality is problematic
               in that this gap is not simply the result of foolish blunder, but is
               rather the result of particular preconditions.
               Women succeeded in entering the artistic realm when they
               gained access to it via the adjoining “pre-aesthetic” realms. In the
               eighteenth century women were able to enter the realm of lit-
               erature by means of letters (the epistolary novel), since this was an
               age in which letters and novels were gaining dignity and the
               dissolution of rigid formal rules allowed greater flexibility. Ex-
               perience could be gained in writing private letters. Since letters
               and diaries have no clearly defined literary niche, it was all right
               for women to practice on them. Only the Romantics considered
               conversation—another feminine domain in literature—to be aes-
               thetic activity. Men were amazed by the new tenor, the new tone,
               the irreverence and more sensual descriptions unique to women’s
               letters, and on occasion they even showed open admiration. It did
               not take long for this medium to be included in the literary canon.
               But it is difficult to merely reach back and link up to these
               feminine” media—letters, weaving. It is, in fact, almost more
               difficult to do this than to work with the “unfeminine” technical
               media such as film, since these need not contend with being tra-
               ditionally relegated to the domain of the housewife. We should not
               foster the false assumptions that our sewing teachers indeed
               pointed us in the right direction. There is no direct path from the
               decorative potholder to the tapestries of Abakanovicz. Besides, I
               am still horrified by the whole ruffles-and-sewing basket business
               we were subjected to as young girls.
               I believe that feminine artistic production takes place by means
               of a complicated process involving conquering and reclaiming, ap-
               propriating and formulating, as well as forgetting and subverting.
               In the works of those female artists who are concerned with the
               women’s movement, one finds artistic tradition as well as the
               break with it. It is good—in two respects—that no formal criteria
               for “feminist art can be definitively laid down. It enables us to re-
               ject categorically the notion of artistic norms, and it prevents
               renewal of the calcified aesthetics debate, this time under the guise
               of the feminist approach.
               If, however, women have different assumptions with regard to
               their sensory approach, their relationship to matter and material,
               their perception, their experience, their means of processing tac-
               tile, visual and acoustic stimuli, their spatial orientation and tem-
               poral rhythm—and all these things are what aesthetics meant at
               one time, according to its original definition as a theory of sensory
               perception—then one could logically expect to find these things ex-
               pressed in special forms of mimetic transformation. Put em-
               phatically, this would mean that within the framework of a female
               cosmology there would be a changed relationship between the sub-
               jective artistic appropriation of reality on the one hand, and formal
               suggestiveness and receptive perception on the other. But it will be
               nearly impossible to find categorical evidence for this changed
               relationship: reality is not that logical, and there is no female
               cosmology either.
               There is no proof of a different (female) relationship to detail
               and generality, to motionlessness and movement, to rhythm and
               demeanor., 1 find the only sensible approach to be the search for
               evidence within individual, concrete texts (pictures, films, etc.), as
               Virginia Woolf once attempted with Dorothy Richardson’s
               writing.
               Virginia Woolf on the language of Dorothy Richardson:10
               She has invented, or, if she has not invented, developed and
               applied to her own uses, a sentence which we might call the
               psychological sentence of the feminine gender. It is of a more
               elastic fibre than the old, capable of stretching to the ex-</p>
            <p>
               treme, of suspending the frailest particles, of enveloping the
               vaguest shapes. Other writers of the opposite sex have used
               sentences of this description and stretched them to the ex-
               treme. But there is a difference. Miss Richardson has
               fashioned her sentence consciously, in order that it may des-
               cend to the depths and investigate the crannies of Miriam
               Henderson’s consciousness. It is a woman’s sentence, but on-
               ly in the sense that it is used to describe a woman’s mind by a
               writer who is neither proud nor afraid of anything that she
               may discover in the psychology of her sex.
               Dorothy Richardson on the masculine manner of writing:1
               The self-satisfied, complacent, know-all condescendingness
               of their handling of their material. . . . The torment of all
               novels is what is left out. The moment you are aware of it
               there is torment in them. Bang, bang, bang, on they go, these
               men’s books, like an L.L.C. tram, yet unable to make you
               forget them, the authors, for a moment.
               The exclusion of women from vast areas of production and the
               public sphere and the fact that most women have been responsible
               for the biological and social reproduction of the species, as well as
               the economic, if they are working, has directed women’s imagina-
               tion along other lines. Moreover, the much touted “ahistoricity” of
               women kept the polarity between intellectual labor and manual
               labor from becoming too traumatic. The disparate development of
               the sexes, though origin of so much of women’s suffering, for-
               tunately has not yet allowed women’s behavior and needs to
               become reified to the degree found in advanced capitalism. But
               generations of women paid for this with their banishment into the
               marital ghetto.
               Is there a feminine aesthetic? Certainly there is, if one is talking
               about aesthetic awareness and modes of sensory perception. Cer-
               tainly not, if one is talking about an unusual variant of artistic pro-
               duction or about a painstakingly constructed theory of art.
               Women’s break with the formal, intrinsic laws of a given medium,
               the release of their imagination—these are unpredictable for an art
               with feminist intentions. There is, thank heavens, no premed-
               itated strategy which can predict what happens when female sen-
               suality is freed. Because it is a process and historically tentative,
               we cannot verbally anticipate this freeing of feminine sensuality
               either at its traditional erotic center (even though there’s a lot go-
               ing on there every month) or in the context of individual
               choice. We can do it only on the basis of a movement by women for
               women.
               The important thing is that women artists will not let themselves
               be kept back anymore. They work on canvas, they make films and
               videotapes, they write and sculpt, they work with metal and with
               fabric, they are on stage. So let us take a look at what they are
               doing.</p>

               Women Talking, Women Thinking
               Joanna Russ</p>
            <p>
               What did we talk about?
               I don’t remember. We talked so hard and sat so still that I got cramps in my knees. We had too many cups of tea and then
               didn’t want to leave the table to go to the bathroom because we didn’t want to stop talking. You will think we talked of revolu-
               tion but we didn’t. Nor did we talk of our own souls. Nor of sewing. Nor of babies. Nor of departmental intrigue. It was politics
               if by politics you mean the laboratory talk that characters in bad movies are perpetually trying to convey (unsuccessfully) when
               they Wrinkle Their Wee Brows and say (valiantly—dutifully—after all, they didn’t write it) “But, Doctor, doesn’t that violate
               Finagle’s Constant?” I staggered to the bathroom, released floods of tea, and returned to the kitchen to talk. It was professional
               talk. It left me grey-faced and with such concentration that I began to develop a headache. We talked about Mary Ann Evans’s
               loss of faith, about Emily Bronté’s isolation, about Charlotte Bronté’s blinding cloud, about the split in Virginia Woolf’s head
               and the split in her economic situation. We talked about Lady Murasaki, who wrote in a form that no respectable man would
               touch, Hroswit, a little name whose plays “may perhaps amuse myself,” Miss Austen who had no more expression in society
               than a firescreen or a poker. They did not all write letters, write memoirs, or go on the stage. Sappho—only an ambiguous,
               somewhat disagreeable name. Corinna? The teacher of Pindar. Olive Schreiner, growing up on the veldt, wrote one book, mar-
               ried happily, and never wrote another. Kate Chopin wrote a scandalous book and never wrote another. (Jean has written
               nothing.) There was M-ry Sh-Il-y who wrote you know what and Ch-rl-tt- P-rk-ns G-lm-n, who wrote one superb horror story
               and lots of sludge (was it sludge?), and Ph-Il-s Wh--tl-y who was black and wrote eighteenth-century odes (but it was the eight
               eenth century) and Mrs. -nn R-del-ff- who wrote silly novels and M-rg-r-t C-v-nd-sh and Mrs. -d-n S--thw-rth and Mrs. G--rg--
               Sh-ld-n and (Miss?) G--rg-tt- H-y-r and B-rb-r- C-rtl-nd and the legion of those who, writing, write not, like the dead Miss B--l-y
               of the poem who was seduced into bad practices (fudging her endings) and hanged herself in her garter. The sun was going
               down. I was blind and stiff.
               * * *
               Twenty years ago I went to college and began to recognize the roof; having dressed for a date (dates were absolutely crucial
               then) in my low heels, my nylons, my garter belt, my horsehair petticoat, my cotton petticoat, my taffeta skirt, my knit jersey
               blouse, my circle pin, my gold earrings, my charm bracelet, my waist-cincher, my lipstick, my little bit of eye shadow, my heavy
               faille coat, my nail polish, my mohair scarf, and my gloves, I went into the dormitory garden to wait. The garden was full of late
               spring flowers. 1 had already admired myself in the full-length mirror on the back of my closet door, but standing between the
               stone walls on the stone-flagged walk, watching the flowers grow ever lighter and more disembodied in the blue twilight—and
               sitting on the stone bench under the Gothic arches and all that ivy—and we were supposed to get A’s and use the library—we
               were supposed to write papers—we were supposed to be scholars—I felt invisible. I felt awful, I wanted to take off all my
               clothes and step out of my underwear. And then take off my hair and fingernails and my face and my flesh and finally my very
               bones. Just to step out of it. All the way out of it.
               My date said, “There you are!

               I’ve spent a lot of my time in the library here, picking out obscure references to memoirs written by bad ladies two hundred
               years ago and novels by worse ladies who, although personally blameless, wrote wicked books: A Romance of the Pyrenees.
               Marianna or The Puritan’s Daughter. Weird, ghastly stuff. Five romances under the pseudonym By a Lady. Domestic senti
               ment. Gothic castles. Purity. If only 1 can reduce this pulp to pulp and spread it out into some kind of shape. Dead voices
               haunting and terrible: I want, I need, I hope, I believe. What sort of homes did they have? Did they do their own cooking? Dic
               they expect to get pregnant every year? (See Mrs. Defoe’s journal.) The awful constriction, the huge skirts. Mrs. Pepys’ dress

               Conversations with the Tooth Fairy.
               When I was five she stood at the foot of my bed in a dream, wearing an airy, blue, nylon-net gown and glittering rhinestone
               jewelry, with a little rhinestone coronet on her head. Her magic wand was star-topped and she looked just like a Tooth Fairy
               should.
               She was going to give me three wishes.
               But I woke up.
               And much later:
               Last night she came again and sat down on the end of my bed, looking very benevolent, spreading out her blue nylon-net
               skirts, and recalling to me (even though I was asleep) where 1 had seen her before—she was somebody I saw in a live stage shov
               when I was four and l’d swear it was the Ice Follies because I remember her in ice skates.
               The Tooth Fairy: Good evening, dear child. I am here to help you.
               Me: Look here, l’m almost forty. This is ridiculous.
               The Fairy: Never mind. To me you will always be a child. Tell me what you want and I shall get it for you.

               A look at early Christian history shows that woman’s lot was
               anything but a lot. Man’s marriage to woman was grudg
               ingly conceded as a necessary evil.1 She was a “foe to friend
               ship, an inevitable penance . . . a domestic peril.”2 It was
               officially questioned whether woman had a soul (in 585, the
               Council of Macon decided that she did, but only by a single
               vote).? Repeatedly admonished to “be in subjection to (her
               own husband,”4 she was, at best, “a natural temptation, a
               ”5 A weak vessel for man s seed, she was a
               coveted calamity.
               plaque on which he could mount his sexual organ.
               For the religious woman, who naturally believed her life
               worthless, there were few alternatives. She could dumbly
               worship the saints or, if ambitious enough, she could emulate
               them: St. Simon Stylites ate very little; St. John of the Cross
               licked the sores of lepers.° And while some women performec
               no less austerely (St. Rose ate nothing but sheep’s gall, ashes
               and bitter herbs, and she drank the blood of a sick patient),
               many—martyred through constant devotion and sacrifice-
               displayed a peculiar brand of sensuality
               Veronica Guliani—who went to bed with, and kissed, and
               suckled a lamb, the lamb being a symbol of Christ—is per
               haps atypical. But not Mechthilde of Madgeburg, who pre-
               ferred to see Jesus as “charming,” affectionate and 18 years
               old. Nor Margaretha of Ypern, who thought herself “en-
               gaged” to Jesus. Nor Christine Ebner, who imagined she
               carried Jesus’ child. The church deliberately inspired such
               sensuous imaginings. “Ever let the Bridegroom sport with
               will put his hand through the hole in the door and will touch
               With nuns “marrying” Christ in a formal
               your belly ...
               ceremony—their “1 love Christ into whose bed I have en
               tered” being roughly equivalent to the modern “I do”—it is
               not surprising that, while most martyrs sought to transcend
               the body, female martyrdom at times unveiled a complexion
               entirely its own. Pocked with the scars of lacerations and
               burnings, flushed with desire for a polygamous, heterosexual
               Jesus, it encouraged a centuries-long tradition of woman's
               self-sacrifice and suffering for man. For only by cleaving to a
               seeming savior or holy man could a woman hope to rise even
               a fraction as much as she had fallen.
               Take the example of Margaret-Mary Alacoque, a particu
               larly fervent practitioner. She shafted a novice for rivaling
               her holiness, lest she rival her also in the Savior’s affections.
               And while her frequent convulsions were probably due to
               austerity—she drank mostly dirty wash-water, and drank
               nothing at all from Thursday to Sunday (though she occas-
               ionally licked up vomit with her tongue)—she was hotly fe
               verish with love of Jesus, even tattooing his name on hei
               chest with a small knife. (When the scars healed, she burned
               in the insignia with a candle.) Such actions were proof of a
               beautiful soul.
               Suffering has long been a value in the west. An attribute of
               saints and a must for martyrs, it has also lately been required
               of the artist, who, as Susan Sontag aptly notes, now replaces
               the saint as exemplary sufferer.” And Sontag’s tenet, 1 think,
               can be reversed: the saint, or martyr, was a kind of artist in
               earlier times. Aestheticians like Jacques Maritain would
               seem to agree, seeing art as “makling) a form shine on the
               matter,” form being “the profound splendor of the soul shin
               ing through .. . the principle . . . of pain and passion.” Liv
               ing in true perfection, he says, “may be metaphorically de-
               scribed as an art . . . an art which only the saints mastei
               fully.
               Now, that Margaret-Mary wasn’t perfect is not impor-
               tant; it’s enough that the church assures us she was. What is
               important is that she was an exemplary sufferer if there ever
               was one. She suffered; she suffered wholly and completely
               and this gave her a decided advantage. For, notes Sontag,
               quoting from the diary of a suffering artist, only through
               such total surrender can we “disarm the power of suffering</p>
            <p>
               make it our own creation, our own choice,”1° By giving in to
               suffering, we mold it, reshape it. We sublimate suffering into
               That life and art can be one and the same is an old idea.
               John Dewey” upheld it, defining art as any activity reshap-
               ing experience more meaningfully, coherently and vividly
               than ordinary life allows. “Emotion,” he says, “is . . . the
               cementing force.” By selecting and coloring, it unifies the
               disparate events of experience, transforming them into an
               experience. “The enemies of the aesthetic, says Dewey,
               are neither the practical or the intellectual. They are the
               hum-drum.
               However repugnant Margaret-Mary’s actions may seem
               by male aesthetic criteria Margaret-Mary was an artist and
               her martyrdom was art. It dictated her every action, and her
               every action was contrived to reflect a beautiful soul.
               Martyrdom provided her with a form for her life, and
               through it she assumed control over the fragmented matter of
               her existence. She indulged in suffering; it engrossed her,
               diverted her, and thoroughly absorbed her. Pain became
               objectified. Life became a passionate performance (indeed.
               her breast resembled a theater marquee), soulful, dramatic
               cohesive, consistent and meaningful. By classical definitions
               of art, her life, in assuming a magnitude and order, fulfilled
               the conditions of the beautiful. In fact, martyrdom for Jesus,
               and later secularized martyrdom for man, has been one of
               woman’s most pervasive and enduring traditional art forms.
               For Margaret-Mary was not alone in indulging in suf
               fering; other women matched her passion. Christine Ebner
               etched out a cross on the skin of her chest and tore it off.
               Mary Magdalene dei Pazzi had herself cut, trampled.
               whipped and burned. Christine of St. Trond had herself
               bound, hung, racked, buried and baked. Surely, Christian-
               ity’s chapter on the martyrs and mystics is one of the most
               astounding chapters in history. Less astounding, perhaps.
               are the women who, like Felicula or Saints Agnes and
               Agatha, opted for tortures over marriage. These women were
               saving themselves for Christ and wouldn’t succumb. But
               there were also martyrs among those who did, like Therese, a
               nineteenth century madwoman and would-be mystic whose
               longing for Christ drove her insane until finally, distracted,
               demoralized and institutionalized, she wrote: “Now I only
               believe in God and suffering. I feel it is necessary to get mar-
               ried.”12 Therese was deranged, but her resignation reflected
               a sordid truth: for many who lived in later centuries, mar
               riage itself had become yet another form of martyrdom,
               supplying an aesthetic where none existed.
               The altruistic female sacrificing for a husband was an old
               ideal. The twelfth-century Marie de France featured her in
               Eliduc where a wife graciously surrenders her husband to a
               woman he loves. Years later, she welcomes the new wife into
               her convent where, sisters in Christ, the two women are
               bound again by love for a single man, the husband and
               Christ being, metaphorically, one and the same
               By the fourteenth century, with Chaucer s and Boccac-
               cio’s patient Griselda, the emphasis had changed.13 A female
               Job, Griselda stands obediently by while her husband humil
               iates her, repudiates her—even when she believes he mur
               dered her children; her only concern is to meet his wants,
               however cruel they seem to her. Now the love of one woman
               for another is strongly de-emphasized—relief can only come
               from man—and man s worth is wholly unquestioned, wom
               an s soul seeming all the greater for his cruelty.
               It was this ideal which began to flourish in the eighteenth
               century. Because Protestantism had changed woman s role,
               transposing mystical values to the domestic sphere, latei
               centuries saw the revival of the martyrdom aesthetic in a new
               light. Aestheticians since Fichte had taught that beauty was
               subjective—a manifestation of the beautiful soul—many be
               lieving, with Muller, that the highest art was the art of life.

               er leaving her immediate neighborhood, not to mention fore-
               going a trip to heaven. Just as, classically, art was a lofty
               reflection of nature, the good wife was a lofty reflection of
               man, so lofty in fact, that she ceased to have substance alto-
               gether (a Dorsetshire wedding ceremony likened her to “
               Mirrour which hath no image of its own”).15 A young girl
               (pupilla) was said to exist in the pupil of every man’s eye,16
               and while this classically meant man s perceptions were soul-
               ful, now it stood for another tenet: that woman should only
               exist in the glazed eyes of man. She was wife only—merely a
               part of her husband’s family, famulus meaning servant on
               slave. As Fichte had also taught: “[Woman’s) own dignity
               requires that she should give herself up entirely as she is . .
               and should utterly lose herself in (her husband).”17
               Now Christ was absent. As with Jane Eyre in the Bronte
               novel, woman was to persist dutifully in soulful devotion to a
               cynical master and, eventually, his contemplation of her-
               distanced and mystical in her suffering goodness—might
               touch his soul and effect his overt transformation. Just as
               Jane restored the blinded Rochester’s vision, so could wom-
               an, like the highest art, elevate a husband’s vision, turning
               cynic into believer, teaching and delighting. A classical rep-
               resentation of beauty, she incited compassion and pity, if not
               fear.
               But such idealizations were fiction, pure fairy tale.
               Bronte’s Jane was, in real life, de Sade’s Justine. A perpetual
               victim, she often suffered for men who were unrelenting,
               unrepenting.
               With religious executions a thing of the past and passion-
               ate martyrdom for Christ wholly repugnant to the Protestant
               ethic, the clergy, who now found marriage desirable, trans-
               ferred the imagery of Jesus onto the husband with new, if
               pedestrian, significance. The female martyr was now
               plunked down in the family cottage where, virtuous and sex-
               less, she suffered for her family. There, mystical and beauti-
               ful, she persevered. Determined and powerless, she perse-
               vered. John Ruskin’s directive was typical: “(Woman must
               be) instinctively, infallibly wise—wise, not for self-develop-
               ment, but for self-renunciation.
               In fact, she hadn’t much choice. The rise of capitalism
               had, by the eighteenth century, aggravated woman s econ-
               omic dependence while it banished traditional duties from
               the home. Domestic spinning, weaving, brewing and baking
               had once been essential and, however tedious, had used up
               time. Now, with moral prohibitions still further diminishing
               woman’s activities, idleness exposed the void. By roman-
               tically and utterly surrendering to suffering, woman might
               become absorbed; life’s form might assume a grandiose
               beauty, masking the pettiness of its content. As before, il
               woman could exalt her suffering, she could shape it, perfect
               it; she could languish in contemplation of her own sorrow.
               Formalized and ritualized, it aesthetically formed and in-
               formed her life. And the aesthetic became an anaesthetic
               For no matter how sentient martyrdom’s manifestations, it
               numbed woman to her own insignificance, protecting hei
               from the more genuine pain of small emotions. The niggling
               void became flushed with feeling, feeling believed to soften
               and deepen the soul. Or so believed Madame de Stael, whose
               exposition on suffering also credited the virtues of habitual
               submisiveness. Her tract was written to justify suicide. No
               wonder.19
               Martyrdom was still an art: no longer for Jesus, no longer
               even for a powerful man whose cruelty masked a beautiful
               soul. It was now martyrdom for any man, be he a stern patri-
               arch or a sodden drunk, or a stemn patriarch and a sodden
               drunk. As Tolstoy saw it: Wives should be loving, unobtru-
               sive and unassuming—“comforters of the drunken, the
               weak, and the dissolute.”2° Or in Fichte’s words: The wife of
               a degenerate husband “is held all the more in esteem the gen-</p>
            <p>
               .she bears it,” though still, she must appear to be
               “lost in the man of her choice.”21 Wet nurses to alcoholics,
               wives soaked their men with spirit, and disappeared.
               In 1920, in a perverse tribute to pained sensibility, Mar-
               garet-Mary Alacoque was canonized. Her emblem was the
               Sacred Heart. It was increasingly presented more and more
               bloodily—grotesque, fiery, disembodied, now an isolate
               lump of throbbing muscle—the pulsing symbol of a female
               aesthetic and the badge of hundreds of Catholic schools.
               The good woman, it thumps, is all heart.
               But its beat is getting ever weaker. Like the allure of habit-
               ual sacrifice itself. Like the utter devotion (submission) for
               which it stands—one passion, indivisible, with guilt and op-
               pression for all. Woman’s fluid acquiescence has leaked its
               glamour, and women are letting women know it.
               Sacrifice is self-abuse. Death to martyrdom.</p>

               an who chooses freedom is necessarily irrational; thus, she cannot sensibly
               assess her motives or use her freedom. It is curiously circular reasoning.</p>

               THE STRAITS OF LITERATURE AND HISTORY</p>
            <p>
               With whom does history empathize? For
               Walter Benjamin, “The answer is inevita-
               ble: with the victor.”1 The reciprocity be-
               tween historian and ruler is tacit: the his-
               torian makes official the ruler’s authority
               and the ruler’s authority gives the histori-
               an’s work validity. This is not to suggest
               that no histories exist that subvert this
               premise. Literature is a “history” which in
               most cases serves the prevailing order
               because its very existence confirms thaf
               order’s cultural richness. But literature is
               privileged because it can employ language’s
               nuance and allusiveness and from the inside
               gently or joltingly criticize that order. Be
               cause literature is by implication a cultural
               artifact of a ruling order, subversive or not
               it is a historical spoil owing as much to the
               anonymous toil that gave the writer time to
               pursue an idea as to the original mind that
               conceived it.
               The connection between a ruling order
               and its cultural artifacts is like a strait sep-
               arating two bodies of water intimately link-
               ed in time and geography. The straits of lit-
               erature and history are evidenced in Jap-
               anese writing of the Heian period (794-1185
               A.D.) which commands interest because of
               its richness of description, its pioneering of
               new forms, and the fact that its leading
               practitioners were women. Many social and
               cultural conditions set the stage for this un-
               precedented predominance of literary
               women. According to Ivan Morris.
               "Though they (peasants, fishermen, forest-
               men and other laborers contributed to the
               vast majority of the (Heian period’s) popula
               tion and were the only economically pro-
               ductive class in the country, we virtually
               have no authentic information about their
               lives.”2 What we today know of Heian life
               has been garnered from the literature of that
               period—especially from Murasaki Shikibu’s
               The Tale of Genji and Sei Shonagon’s The
               Pillow Book—but these literary milestones
               detailing Heian court life treat a population
               of only about one-tenth of one percent of the
               five million population in Japan at that
               time.
               Murasaki’s and Sei’s originality of form
               and observation is unparalleled in the
               history of literature. These two women were</p>
            <p>
               Carrie Rickey
               contemporaries; both were brought to court
               from the provinces because of their talent
               and intelligence. Due to the complications
               of Japan’s clan politics, there was a “court
               with many satellite courts, and it is not
               known whether these two women ever lived
               in the same palace, although they were
               aware of each other’s writings. Their social
               position was substantially different from
               that of the women outside the court who
               “toiled arduously, were subject to harsh
               treatment by their men, bred young, and
               died early
               Murasaki and Sei are figures of incalcu-
               lable significance because they were pio-
               neers, because they produced work in a
               period which had articulated for itself a dis
               tinct masculine and feminine aesthetic, and
               because they wrote in Japanese at a time
               when the language for official and theologi-
               cal affairs was Chinese (cf. the European
               use of Latin as an “official” language). Not
               only did they establish traditions of the psy-
               chological novel and the diary, but their
               writings preserved the Japanese language
               for subsequent generations. In their day
               women were restricted to the use of Japan
               ese while men exchanged ideas and conver
               sation in Chinese. Even today the dis-
               tinction between native syllabary and the
               Chinese characters incorporated into the
               language reflects this gender dichotomy.
               The native characters are called onnade, or
               woman’s hand,” while Chinese character
               are known as otokomoji, “man’s letters.”
               Sei’s writings are still studied today for the
               purity of her Japanese diction; she avoidec
               Chinese-isms—an accomplishment compar-
               able to writing in English without using any
               Latinate words.
               In the time of Murasaki and Sei there
               were no narrative literary traditions to
               maintain. Japanese literature before their
               time had been poetry of a calculatedly
               oblique nature; a long prologomena was
               necessary to explain the poem’s meaning.
               What a remarkable achievement to conceive
               a psychological novel—as Murasaki did-
               where a poem appears as an organic expres-
               sion within the context of a narrative and re
               quires no annotation to be understood
               Murasaki fused the traditional poetic form</p>
            <p>
               with her narrative innovation, the intimate
               epic. Sei’s Pillow Book was so called
               because she suggested to the empress that
               notebooks of historical documents could be
               recycled by making them into a pillow (a
               word that referred to a diary as well as a
               head rest); Sei filled her notebook with lists,
               odd facts and observations from the present,
               thereby annotating the leaves of official
               history with her lively opinions.“ For both
               these women, objectivity was the domain of
               the historian and untenable because it neu-
               tralized differing positions. Objects and peo-
               ple, in the writings of Murasaki and Sei.
               have innumerable facets. They intimated
               the spirit of an object or a person by bom-
               barding the reader with dense description:
               lists, textures, physical and natural detail.
               Collectively their historical truth is compel
               ling because they replace “objectivity” with
               opinionation.
               But these two contemporaries reflected
               different attitudes about their culture. Sei
               begins a chapter of her book with: “When I
               make myself imagine what it is like to be one
               of those women who live at home, faithfully
               serving their husbands—women who have
               not a single exciting prospect in life yet be-
               lieve they are perfectly happy—I am filled
               with scorn.”7 In a passage where Murasaki
               describes Genji’s (and by implication her
               own) view of the novel, Genji observes,
               “Without it what should we know of how
               people lived in the past from the age of the
               Gods down to the present day? For history
               books . . . show us only one corner of life;
               whereas these diaries and romances which I
               see piled around you contain, 1 am sure, the
               most minute information about people's
               private affairs.”° Sei and Murasaki charted
               divergent routes in their writing: Sei was an
               empiricist recording impressions of contem-
               porary Heian manners; she lacked the self-
               consciousness of Murasaki, who fashioned a
               world in the indeterminate past in order to
               best intuitively comment on life in her im-
               mediate present. Sei’s literary concerns were
               the refined tastes of the nobility and the
               freshness of nature. Murasaki was less im-
               pressionistic and more analytic in her eval-
               uation of Heian society. She continuously
               tells us that it was best to be born a man of</p>

               imperial blood and live at the court. But she
               was keenly aware of the hierarchies within
               the aristocracy and observed the tension
               between provincials and the court clique, as
               well as sensitively articulating the social
               restrictions limiting the mobility of the lower
               ranks within the court.
               A number of factors informed the atti-
               tudes Sei and Murasaki expressed. The
               birth of a woman was a happy event because
               in the marriage politics of Heian society a
               woman might grow up to marry the emper-
               or. It was much easier in their day for a
               woman of “inferior” birth to marry a man of
               noble rank than vice versa. The professions
               which brought a lower-rank man to the cap-
               ital—scholar or priest, say—would not auto-
               matically give him ingress to the imperial
               circle, while it seems likely that Sei and
               Murasaki were brought to the court because
               of their reputations as women of wit and
               sensibility. In Heian Japan a woman was
               allowed both to inherit and own property.
               The civil codes expressly forbade wife-beat-
               ing, although the punishment for this was
               two degrees less than assaulting other
               people.”° But these facts don’t pinpoint the
               complex and inbred quality of Heian life,
               which is best described by the Chinese prov-
               erb: “The people are as far from the Emper
               or as from heaven. Japanese appropriation
               of China s governmental centralization pro-
               duced a bureaucracy so awkward in this
               land of decentralized clans that the delega-
               tion of authority was carried to extreme
               lengths; the source of authority was, accord-
               ingly, far removed from the functionary who
               directly wielded it. Because the real power
               was exercised by ministers and other imperi-
               al subalterns, the emperor was left with two
               functions: to encourage new art forms and
               fashion rituals of piety from the religious hy-
               brid of Shinto and Buddhist beliefs. Women
               were excluded from public affairs, but they
               played a tremendous role in the Heian
               court. A well-born woman had leisure and
               imperial encouragement for creation and
               contemplation denied to male counterparts
               busy with official duties and polygamous
               pursuits (the man at the Heian court was ex-
               pected to have a wife and a few mistresses).</p>
            <p>
               If Murasaki’s and Sei’s writings are an in-
               dex to female sexual options during the
               Heian period, aristocratic women enjoyed a
               multiplicity of partners as well. Later ages
               would revile Sei and Murasaki for their
               foully licentious”1° descriptions, but prom-
               iscuity was a vital element of their culture
               The largely endogamous Heian court was
               energized by the covert alliances of pro-
               vincials with sovereigns and their
               subalterns. The ruling clan of the Heian
               period—the Fujiwaras—never commanded
               significant military strength but established
               power by marrying their daughters to sover-
               eigns. The famous Fujiwara Michinaga was
               father-in-law of two emperors, grandfather
               of a third, grandfather and greatgrandfather
               of a fourth, grandfather and father-in-law of
               a fifth." This kind of inbreeding was the
               substructure of the court clique. The
               nominal source of power, this clique was at-
               tractive because it nurtured the creation of
               art. But it needed the vitality of provincials
               like Sei and Murasaki to regenerate its in-
               cestuous ranks.
               Once at court, Sei and Murasaki became
               insiders who made observations on the
               social arts at a time when manners were
               politics and politics culture. Murasaki wrote
               of a picture competition designed by Genji
               to rechannel court enmities to less des-
               tructive ends: “It was indeed a moment in
               the history of our country when the whole
               energy of the nation seemed to be concen-
               trated upon the search for the prettiest
               method of mounting paper scrolls.”12
               Murasaki’s and Sei’s importance is that
               while they operated in a culture that re-
               garded women as inferior to men, they never
               believed that of themselves. Although in her
               diary Murasaki repeatedly alluded to her
               father’s regret that because of her great in-
               telligence she had not been born male, she
               characterized the richness of both male and
               female experiences in Genji. Although it is
               clear in Genji that men have more options
               available to them, women are equal in wit,
               intelligence and style. Sei, perhaps because
               of her position as the empress’ favorite, is
               much more interested in the doings of im-
               perial ladies than those of gentlemen. Mur-

               asaki’s and Sei’s writing was expressly
               power-identified at a time when power was
               not so much a link with male dominance as
               it was one expression in a complex social
               milieu in which women participated. Mura-
               saki and Sei dealt with emotions that are
               universally intelligible and exist cross-
               culturally—unlike the objective specificities
               of the official histories and philosophies in
               which the men of their day engaged. Edu-
               cated women were able to act and write less
               conventionally than were men of com-
               parable status.
               Could a Heian man have created work
               like Murasaki and Sei? The self-conscious
               Heian court was totally aware of the sexual
               division of speech and the exclusion of
               women from the public sphere. Only at
               court could women circulate and not be
               expected to hide behind fans and screens,
               the way propriety demanded women do out-
               side the court. The masculine style,
               identified by scholars of Japanese literature
               as well as by Murasaki and Sei in various
               appreciations of male qualities, was “the di-
               rectness of utterance and concern with
               society.”1 The “feminine preference was
               taken to be the interest in suggestion and in-
               tuition—which was the style imitated by
               men when they wrote to women or expressed
               themselves in affairs of the heart. A man
               could have written in the style of Murasaki
               and Sei, and, indeed, some men assumed
               the feminine voice and pretended to be
               women authors. But the incisiveness and
               sensibility of these female impersonators is
               inferior to the work of Murasaki and Sei.
               The inference that women sensed nuance in
               affairs of state while men were consigned
               blindly to conduct these affairs leads to a
               simplistic women feel/men think conclu-
               sion that fails to cut through psychology or
               historicism. Men couldn’t create work like
               Murasaki and Sei, even though they tried.
               These women were successful in capturing
               the range of experience and feeling of both
               sexes.
               Why were they successful? They glorified
               a shining nobility. They catalogued and or-
               dered a courtly etiquette rich in gestural nu-
               ance, which inspired contemporary court</p>

               behavior. They articulated a feminine posi-
               tion to which men could respond. Both pro-
               vincials, they described a life outside the
               court that seemed raw and exotic to the in-
               bred Heian court. Murasaki characterized
               the province/capital dichotomy when she
               wrote about Genji’s scrolls made during his
               exile on the Suma coast: “Amid intense ex-
               citement . . . (they) produced a roll con-
               taining Genji’s sketches at Suma .
               masterly a hand working at complete leisure
               and far from the distracting influences
               which beset an artist in town. They saw so
               vividly presented both the stem manner of
               his life there and in some sort the feelings
               which this rustic life had aroused in
               everyone used to every luxury and in-
               dulgence.”" Soon after The Tale of Genji
               appeared at court, Genji was adopted as a
               Shinto deity.15
               Sei’s open competition with men—even
               with those of a higher rank—gave the Heian
               court a model of an openly combative
               woman who refused to acquiesce to the pre-
               vailing notions of female propriety. She
               writes with glee how she embarrassed the
               minister Nobutsune (who was Murasaki's
               cousin): “One day when Nobutsune was
               serving as Intendant in the Office of Palace
               Works he sent a sketch to one of the crafts-
               men explaining how a certain piece of work
               should be done. Kindly execute in this
               fashion,’ he added in Chinese characters. I
               happened to notice the piece of paper and it
               was the most preposterous writing 1 had
               ever seen. Next to his message I wrote, 'If
               you do the work in this style, it will certainly
               turn out strangely.” The document found its
               way to the imperial apartment, and every-
               one who saw it was greatly amused—except,
               of course, Nobutsune, who was furious and
               after this held a grudge against me.
               Murasaki acidly noted in her diary, “Some-
               one [Sei who makes such an effort to be dif-
               ferent from others is bound to fall in
               people’s esteem and 1 can only think her
               future will be a hard one. She is a gifted
               woman, to be sure . . . how can things turn
               out well for such a woman?”17
               Sei and Murasaki challenged the religious
               as well as social assumptions of their society.</p>
            <p>
               They shaped as well as recorded their civ-
               ilization; there are few other instances of
               such literary power and evocativeness.
               History regards Heian Japan as a golden
               age whose achievements rank with those of
               Byzantium, Athens, and Renaissance Italy.
               T’he work of these two women recorded that
               period with greater depth and insight than
               any other contemporary cultural products,
               so much so that virtually all that is known
               about the period has been learned from their
               writings.
               Two questions remain: What is the
               deeper meaning of a golden age”? What
               was Murasaki’s and Sei’s relationship to the
               golden age they so consummately character-
               ized? An age is golden” in contrast to the
               generations of dross preceding and suc-
               ceeding it. An age is golden” because cul-
               tural achievements complement political
               strength and together give the impression of
               an ideal social harmony. Cultural achieve-
               ments in Heian were enjoyed, as is so often
               the case, by a few at the expense of many.
               Like two facing mirrors, the literature re-
               flected the glory of the ruling class and vice
               versa. But there were some distortions. In
               reading these works—as literature or as his-
               torical documents—there is a striking
               double edge to each. Murasaki’s choice to
               place her tale in the indeterminate past sug-
               gests two contradictory readings: Did the
               paucity of excitement and intelligence at the
               court encourage her to invent a perfect and
               brilliant hero, or was court life so thrilling
               she was inspired to glorify it? Whichever,
               there is throughout Murasaki’s novel a wist-
               fulness of “wouldn’t it be nice if it were this
               way which suggests dissatisfaction with the
               way it was, and the characters still alive at
               the close of the novel are so morally and in-
               tellectually inferior to Genji that her conclu-
               sion has a hopeless tone. Sei’s devotion to
               the imperial family and her contempt for the
               lower orders (an attitude that prompted a
               Japanese scholar to call her a “spiritual
               cripple”18) reveals a mindset that for the
               Heian court was good breeding but for the
               modern reader is patronizing and blind.
               Sei’s circumscribed vision and partisanship
               today says more about the exclusion of the</p>
            <p>
               lower classes from Heian society by omission
               than do the scanty histories from the period.
               Sei’s and Murasaki’s historical reflections
               are powerful and moving, simultaneously
               evocative of Heian pageantry and of the
               sadness of a society where leisure and
               culture was reserved for a chosen few. No
               culture, no golden age wants to be tar-
               nished by an enumeration of its prejudices
               and oppressions. Murasaki’s and Sei’s lit-
               erature both criticized and apotheosized
               their era and, in doing so, exemplifies the
               straits of literature and history.</p>

               a slaveholder in Washington City, says,—
               “The Rev. Mr. M—, now of the Hunting

               was about visiting his old friends o
               on whatis com
               monly called the “Eastern Shore.
               Late in th
               asternoon, on his
               journey, he called at the bouse
               of Rev. A. C. of P

               ther he had been long acquainted. Just at that
               juncture Mr. C. was about proceeding to whip:
               colored female, who was his slave. She wa
               nly tied to a post in FRONT of his dwelling
               use. The arrival of a clerical visitor at such
               time, occasioned a temporary delay in the exect
               tion of Mr. C.’s purpose. But the delay was onl
               temporary ; for not even the presence of such :
               guest could destroy the bloody design.  he gues
               interceded with all the mildness yet earnestness
               brother and new visitor. But all in vain
               woman had been sAUCY and must be punish

               the neck is left entirely exposed. As the cow

               seldom witnessed; that
               was the brutal chastisement of your negro girl
               lashed to a ladder and beaten in an inhuman man-
               ner, too bad to describe. My blood chills while

               What is the place of textuality in feminist criticism? (I
               mean criticism both in the narrow sense of literary criticism
               and in the broad sense of sociocultural critique.) Since text-
               ual analysis has a fundamental place in any theory of cul-
               ture, how should the feminist critic approach her work with
               texts? What should her purpose be? 1 am not sure that a the-
               ory of women’s writing is useful or even desirable at this
               point. Because women have been a colonized population for
               so long, 1 fear that any critical category we may find applic-
               able today is likely to be derived from or imbued with male
               ideologies. As writers, critics, teachers, we know this from
               our daily experiences. I am not suggesting that we ought to
               clean the slate of history and start anew because 1 am enough
               of a historical materialist and semiotician that 1 cannot con-
               ceive of a totally new world rising out of, and in no way con-
               nected with, the past or the present. 1 believe neither in utop-
               ias nor in the myth of Paradise Now, or ever. What I am
               suggesting is that theory is dialectically built on, checked
               against, modified by, transformed along with, practice—that
               is to say, with what women do, invent, perform, produce,
               concretely and not “for all time” but within specific histori-
               cal and cultural conditions.
               In the summer of 1975, I was in the small town of Sant’
               Arcangelo di Romagna (near Bologna, Italy) where an open-
               air theater festival sponsored performances by militant and
               experimental groups in the town square and courtyards of
               two medieval castles. One of these performances attracted
               my attention by its title, Nonostante Gramsci (Despite
               Gramsci). It was performed by a militant feminist collective,
               La Maddalena, based in Rome. Antonio Gramsci was foun-
               der of the Italian Communist Party and one of the major
               European Marxist thinkers. He was the most important in-
               fluence on the Italian left in general and on the politics of the
               Italian Communist Party (PCI) in particular. His historical
               analyses and theoretical foundations for Italian communism
               continue to be effective today.
               Gramsci was imprisoned in 1926 by the newly consolidat-
               ed Fascist dictatorship. He received a mock trial, was given a
               life sentence, and died in 1937 of illness and abuse suffered in
               one of Mussolini’s prisons. The circumstances of his death
               and his extraordinary intellectual and moral stature have
               made him perhaps the greatest hero and martyr of the Italian
               resistance. This is why the play’s title, Despite (or Notwith-
               standing) Gramsci, surprised and intrigued me, since I knew
               that Italian feminist groups consist almost exclusively of
               women with a record of militancy in the left. They couldn’t
               be against” Gramsci. Therefore, what did they mean by
               despite”
               The background of the production reveals the group’s
               ideological stance. Both the text of the theatrical production
               and the underlying research on original documents were
               published together the following year under the editorship of</p>
            <p>
               Adele Cambria, a feminist writer and one of the editors of
               the major Italian feminist monthly EFFE.1 Cambria formu-
               lated and conducted the research, but the theatrical work
               was performed, directed and written collectively. The pub-
               lished volume, entitled Amore come rivoluzione (Love as
               Revolution) contains 1 believe not two texts—one creative/
               artistic and one historical/biographical—but rather a single
               text. It self-consciously attempts to be at once historical and
               artistic, and deliberately presents itself as tendentious and
               critical. It is a text with its ideology clearly stated and with a
               basis of original research behind its fiction. This text is pos-
               ited as a set of questions dealing with love and revolution—a
               complex problem that emerged in the late 1960s, was pushed
               to the foreground of political consciousness by radical femin-
               ism, and is one of the major issues in revolutionary politics
               today.
               During the last eleven years of his life, the imprisoned
               Gramsci wrote the bulk of his theoretical work now pub-
               lished as Quaderni dal carcere (Prison Notebooks)?? In 1922
               Gramsci spent several months in the Soviet Union as Italian
               envoy to the Executive Committee of the Communist Inter-
               national. While hospitalized in a sanatorium outside Mos-
               cow, he met Eugenia Schucht, also a patient in the hospital,
               and her sister Giulia. Giulia and Antonio fell in love. After
               Gramsci had returned to Western Europe, recalled by his
               political duties, their son Delio was born in 1924. The couple
               were together only once again, the following year, when
               Giulia, the baby and Eugenia spent a few months in Rome
               with Gramsci who by then had been elected to the Italian
               parliament. When she returned to the Soviet Union, Giulia
               was pregnant with their second son, Giuliano, whom Gram-
               sci never saw. History records that during his long years in
               prison, the only link between Gramsci and his family was
               Giulia s other sister, Tatiana Schucht, who lived in Italy and
               followed Gramsci as he was sent from one jail to another. She
               supported him materially and spiritually, assisting him
               through his long agony. It is Tatiana who rescued Gramsci’s
               Prison Notebooks after his death. But, history being the his-
               tory of men, only Gramsci’s letters were deemed important
               historical documents.? The letters he received from Giulia
               and Tatiana were not published, although they existed, lying
               in a file at the Gramsci Institute in Rome. Official historiog-
               raphy scorned them. They were women’s letters, dealing
               only with children and marmalade,” banal, insignificant.
               Little information could be found about these mute women,
               whose complex relationships to Gramsci and to one another
               constituted the most intense private aspect of Gramsci’s life
               as a revolutionary. Biographers record that Giulia grew more
               and more alienated from her husband as a result of mental
               illness. In his letters he lamented and grieved over her
               silence. Tatiana acted as a sister of mercy, visiting Gramsci
               in jail, sending him socks and medicines, relaying letters bet-</p>

            <p>
               ween him, Giulia and the children. Here ends their official
               history. Yet, if we read Gramsci’s letters many of the ques
               tions posed in them remain unanswered: What exactly was
               the nature of Giulia’s “illness”? Why did Tatiana and not
               she stay in Italy to assist him in jail? What moved Tatiana to
               literally devote her life to him? What was Eugenia’s role?
               There is no doubt that Gramsci’s thoughts were directed to
               these private concerns as much as to political problems and
               theory—his letters prove it despite the self-restraint imposed
               by personal ethics and prison censorship. Some of his most
               beautiful letters to Giulia deal with the education of their
               children and with the problems posed by his responsibilities
               to the revolution and to their love relationship—he even sug-
               gested a formal separation that would allow Giulia to re-
               marry, if that would restore her well-being.
               Who were these women outside of the pale, pathetic hagi-
               ography constructed by Gramsci’s biographers? This is what
               Adele Cambria set out to investigate. She carefully read all of
               the women’s letters in conjunction with Gramsci’s, inter-
               viewed people who had been close friends of the sisters, stud-
               ied Eugenia’s letters to a friend in Rome and the notebooks
               in which Giulia had practiced compositions as an adolescent.
               Cambria’s purpose throughout was to reconstruct an affec-
               tive biography of the Schuchts and to discover the sources
               and modes of that emotional energy” Shulamith Firestone
               identifies as the essential female contribution to male
               thought.' Cambria’s project was a political one: to rewrite
               history, inscribing in it the missing voices of women, and
               therefore to examine the relationships between the private
               and the public, love and revolution, personal/sexual/emo-
               tional needs and political militancy—relations which she sees
               as the moving forces of all revolutionary struggle. In restor-
               ing to Gramsci’s epistolary monologue its real nature as dia-
               logue, Cambria adds depth to the cultural image of a person
               whose complex humanity has been expediently stereotyped.
               In a letter to Giulia in 1924, before his imprisonment and
               at the height of revolutionary activities Gramsci himself
               posed the problem. He wrote:
               How many times have I asked myself whether it was possible
               to tie oneself to a mass without ever having loved anyone . . .
               whether one could love a collectivity if one hadn’t deeply
               loved some single human beings . . . Wouldn’t this have
               made barren my qualities as a revolutionary, wouldn’t it
               have reduced them to a pure intellectual fact, a pure mathe
               matical calculation?
               Gramsci’s question unwinds the ideological thread that runs
               through Cambria’s work and the collective theater produc-
               tion, both of which focus on the “private” aspect of Gram-
               sci’s life. Thus an understanding of the Schucht family is es-
               sential, in the context of the turn-of-the-century cultural val-
               ues and of the changes brought by the October Revolution.
               Lenin, and later by Stalinism and Fascism.
               Apollo Schucht, father of the three sisters, was an exile
               from czarist Russia who had settled in Rome in 1908. Born
               into the upper bourgeoisie, he had belonged to the Russian
               populist social reform movement (narodvolcstvo) in the mid-
               nineteenth century. Deported with Lenin to Siberia where
               his third daughter, Eugenia, was born, he asked his friend
               Lenin to be her “godfather.” The family lived in Rome from
               1908 to 1917. After the October Revolution, they all returned
               to the Soviet Union and worked in the CPSU except Tatiana
               who stayed at her teaching position in Rome. Significantly
               nothing much is known of Apollo’s wife, Lula, except that
               she was an excellent cook and housewife. It was Apollo’s
               strong influence that shaped the lives of his daughters. His
               world view, in matters of sex roles, was all but revolutionary.
               His daughters completed their higher education in Rome in</p>
            <p>
               the arts and natural sciences, areas that clearly trained wom-
               en for the only careers suitable for them—marriage and
               teaching. The early writings of Giulia and Eugenia reveal
               how deeply they had absorbed their father’s late-romantic
               humanitarian values: a sense of duty toward the poor and
               dispossessed; contact with nature as a source of happiness,
               goodness and personal fulfillment; the love of children ideal-
               ized as a pure unspoiled manifestation of Good Nature; a
               sentimental attachment to Family as nest and shelter from
               the disorder and potential danger of the outside world. None
               of this prepared them for the violent realities in which they
               were to live. In the turmoil after the revolution there came
               into their lives the man who, like their father before him, was
               to magnetize their existence. Gramsci became, for all three
               women, the center of their emotional world, the unwitting
               protagonist of romantic mystification, the pivot of a patriar-
               chal model they had deeply internalized. They all were in
               love with Antonio.
               Eugenia met him first, but he fell in love with Giulia, the
               youngest, most beautiful and most “feminine” of them.
               Cambria documents, fairly convincingly, that Eugenia’s es-
               pousal of the Communist cause—her wedding” to the Party
               -came right after Antonio and Giulia met. The sisters’ close
               mother-daughter relationship had made Giulia emotionally
               and intellectually dependent on her older sister. Eugenia
               later exploited this by making herself indispensable, support-
               ing her financially, taking care of her children and living
               with her before and during Gramsci’s imprisonment, thus re-
               inforcing Giulia’s feelings of personal inadequacy in the roles
               of mother and wife. In Cambria’s interpretation, Eugenia
               was mainly responsible for keeping Giulia away from Gram-
               sci. Her reasons were consistent with the prevailing values of
               the time: Giulia must stay in the Soviet Union to care for the
               children who would be in great danger in Fascist Italy;
               Giulia was “sickly and subject to depressions”; Giulia was a
               Soviet communist and the Party needed her. Eradicating
               from her life the possibility of a private relationship with
               any man, Eugenia played the male role as political activist
               and head of the household. While praising and mythicizing
               Gramsci as a revolutionary leader (she translated his writings
               for the Soviet workers), Eugenia increased the human dis-
               tance between him and Giulia.
               Tatiana met Antonio after his return to Rome, already
               married” to Giulia (officially recorded after the first child
               was born). Tatiana’s love for Gramsci, avowed as sisterly
               love, developed over the twelve years during which she per-
               formed for him the duties of the prisoner’s wife. A close read-
               ing of their letters shows the ambivalence of their relation-
               ship which, considering their strong ethical sense and mater-
               ial and social constraints, was perhaps the most fulfilling, if
               deformed, love relationship of any of the Schucht sisters. In
               defining herself as Giulia s representative, she slowly made
               herself indispensable to the man she loved. She maintained
               contact with underground left leaders outside Italy in hope-
               less attempts to free Gramsci through prisoner exchanges. As
               the only correspondent authorized by jail officials, she copied
               and relayed his letters to Giulia and the children and theirs to
               him. By this “charitable sacrifice and sisterly devotion, and
               by never allowing her own needs to surface (but they are
               there, between the lines of the letters), Tatiana gradually ac-
               quired a wife’s right to husbandly gratitude, a wifely
               possessiveness and the subtle power gained by female self-
               denial.
               Of the three stories, unrecorded by history, Giulia’s is the
               most lonely. She is still alive, as far as we know, in some
               psychiatric hospital where she has spent most of her life, im-
               prisoned in her “mental illness” as Antonio was in his cell.</p>

               He burned in the hell of pain, captivity and death, but he
               won—he is a protagonist of history. Giulia is still burning,
               quietly, bothering no one, unnoticed, useless. One of Cam
               bria’s most significant contributions to feminist analysis is
               her effort to understand Giulia’s personal world with love
               and generosity, outside of myth and without mystification.
               She sees Giulia as a sensitive, intelligent, gifted woman in
               whom the traditional female socialization, with its emphasis
               on dependence, frailty and childlike trust, found a most re-
               ceptive terrain. Giulia did not relate intellectually to others
               or to her own experience. Women of her time were not sup-
               posed to. She needed direct sensuous contact with reality,
               her children, her man. She gave up her violin for her children
               and the Party. The distance between her and Antonio was
               caused not only by circumstances but also by decisions made
               for her by Eugenią, to which Gramsci acquiesced. Her re-
               sponse to the distance was expressed by a sense of personal
               inadequacy, increasing depression, surrendering her will to
               others and to the mechanical details of daily existence. The
               notion that absence makes the heart grow fonder did not
               work for her: she blamed herself for not being able to feel, for
               losing contact with Antonio who was becoming a mere ab-
               straction—The Father of Her Children, The Revolutionary
               Hero—no longer her lover whom she could touch nor her
               friend whom she could see and hear and speak to. She felt
               guilty about this and when she finally dared to write to him
               about her illness he did not answer, could not accept the idea
               of mental illness, spoke harshly of psychoanalysis as a
               crutch, and like the rest of the family recommended iron, vit-
               amins and will power. No one ever seriously considered the
               possibility that Giulia move to Italy to assist Antonio, and
               she herself believed that she could never do for him what
               Tatiana did. In short, Eugenia and Tatiana usurped her
               roles as mother, housekeeper and wife and effectively de-
               prived her of meaningful emotional relationships and inten-
               sified her sense of powerlessness. At last, Cambria main-
               tains, Giulia’s inability to define herself conceptually or
               through any type of personal power, and the unreality of her
               existence that could not function within any socially accepted
               mode of female behavior, pushed Giulia to live her rebellion
               inwardly, in total passivity. This is precisely what is often
               diagnosed as madness in women.“
               In a sense, the personalities and social roles assumed by
               the three Schucht sisters sketch almost to a T the only
               choices allowed women in most Western cultures: service
               functions within male structures, adherence to the feminine
               mystique of charity, sacrifice and self-denial, and madness.
               The textual strategies of Amore come rivoluzione are the
               result of ideological choices. The materials being mainly let-
               ters, there were three obvious genre possibilities: (1) publish-
               ing the letters, with some editing (as was done with Gramsci’s
               letters); (2) putting together a sort of three-way epistolary
               novel of Giulia’s, Tatiana’s and Gramsci’s letters; or (3) giv-
               ing the materials a narrative form, i.e., writing a biography
               of the Schucht sisters. Cambria discarded all three alterna-
               tives. Her decision to avoid a “novelistic” organization was a
               political as well as aesthetic choice: as recent critical theory
               in literature and film argues, narrative form is the primary
               aesthetic code developed to convey bourgeois and counter-
               revolutionary values.” Simply printing the letters without at-
               tempting to reproduce such physical” qualities as hand-
               writing, or the context in which they were written and dis-
               covered, would have erased altogether the function of the
               subject (Cambria herself), as both writer and narrator of her
               book and at the same time reader of the Schucht letters.
               Cambria chose to print portions of the original documents
               in italics interspersed with passages from Gramsci’s letters,</p>
            <p>
               quotations, statements by friends or others involved in the
               events, while her own comments link, interpret and contex-
               tualize each passage. The rigorous separation, by different
               typefaces, between the women’s letters and her own com-
               mentary explicitly manifests the interpretive nature of the
               commentary, its tendentiousness, its having a viewpoint, its
               being “sectarian” rather than an innocent or “objective” ex-
               planation. In this manner, a twofold process is set in motion
               in the text: the release of affective energies contained in the
               firsthand documents, which were personal writings aimed at
               a real person (Gramsci), not a literary readership; and the re-
               lease of a corresponding emotional response in the modern
               woman reading the letters and mediating them for us
               through her personal and ideological, affective and concep-
               tual codes. In many passages Cambria shares her emotion at
               discovering the letters, looking at the faded colors of the pa-
               per, the elegant old-fashioned handwriting of Tatiana, the
               broken sentences and pencil scrawls of an already ill Giulia.
               Cambria also describes her feelings as she approached the
               Moscow house where Giulia lived and where Cambria inter-
               viewed her son Giuliano.“
               Cambria conveys to readers how she absorbed Giulia,
               Tatiana and Eugenia as fragments of her own self, how their
               experiences can act as reactor to other women’s understand-
               ing of themselves; she also conveys her elation in discovering
               and unearthing a writing which is the testimony of unknown
               women. She reaches into an immense reservoir of women’s
               folklore, millions of letters in which women have spent their
               imagination and creativity writing to those they loved, all
               lost, but for the few who made literary history by loving a
               male protagonist.
               The performance I saw was in an open courtyard and used
               the Brechtian concept of epic theater. In the theatrical text,
               the double function of the subject as writer and as reader is
               dramatized in the character of The Girl, epic narrator and
               didactic commentator, who circulates among the four char-
               acters (the three sisters and Gramsci), each of whom is con-
               fined to an assigned scenic space. The Girl has a double
               function: as narrator and commentator, she provides the his-
               torical background and the feminist interpretation of the per-
               formed action. As character, she voices the lyrical conscious-
               ness of the play, Woman-Orpheus. A contemporary woman,
               she is a barometer for the audience, reacting with pity and
               anger to the events enacted around her. The fact that she
               also acts visibly as a stage hand (she projects the slides,
               moves the structures, dresses the actors) is a brilliant theatri-
               cal idea for she is perceived by the audience as a performer,
               i.e., as a real person participating in the entire fictional cre-
               ation and not simply acting out a memorized part in some-
               body else’s play. Furthermore, since she models audience
               response, it is very important that she does not remain emo-
               tionally detached or objective in relation to the characters; at
               the same time her involvement must never become total.
               For, in the intentions of the epic theater, the audience and
               the performers must not identify totally with the characters,
               must not be drawn into the story forgetting that it is a fiction,
               must not experience catharsis at the conclusion of the play.
               Rather, they must remain conscious of the problems raised
               by the play and seek their solution outside, after the play, in
               the real world. One example: in “dressing” Giulia, revealing
               her to us, The Girl is a woman of today discovering her roots
               in a woman of the past and re-enacting herself in a fictional
               character. But when The Girl acts out the pain of pregnancy
               and childbirth, shouting her rejection of motherhood as a
               physical violence done to her body, as an emotionally trau-
               matic infringement on her total person, at this moment The
               Girl is Giulia; she expresses the feeling that Giulia could</p>

               never express, the repression of which was one of the forms
               of her “insanity.
               Certain aspects of this production—the use of voices on
               tape, slides, lighting, the designed structures, objects of per
               sonal “ritual” created by the performers—are discussed in
               the direction notes and contributions by performers and
               designers printed in the appendix to the volume. These pro-
               vide an integral, essential part of the text, outlining the dif-
               ficult but rewarding practice of the performance, collective
               in every aspect from writing to staging to each performer’s
               self-direction.
               The historical text and the theatrical text were conceived
               interdependently. Although they are addressed to different,
               if overlapping, audiences and make different assumptions as
               textual mechanisms, they are not two distinct texts as would
               be, say, a biography and a play based on it. They are, rather,
               one set of raw materials examined with an identical ideologi-
               cal perspective and presented differently to achieve a double
               impact by juxtaposition; when we experience them together,
               the historical text has a distancing effect from the highly
               emotional impact of the dramatic text. The first is rational,
               documented, footnoted; the second is lyrical and intensely
               charged with emotion. The verbal material in the play is
               almost entirely from the original letters, with the addition of
               some contemporary poems and other quotations which serve
               as intertextual links to expand the historical resonance of the
               themes.
               The characteristic features of Cambria’s entire work point
               to a new practice and vision of the relation between subject
               and modes of textual production.? As for the form of content:
               historical, not mythical materials are chosen from a concrete
               situation and real events. These are not necessarily contem-
               porary but always refer to the current concerns of the audi-
               ence.1° The historical events are examined in their socio
               cultural complexity from the ideological and emotional view-
               points of contemporary feminism. The human sources of
               these views—writers, performers and the specific audience
               addressed (this is a play for women)—are clearly identified to
               avoid mystification and mythologizing. As for the form of ex-
               pression: the rejection of the novelistic as the single organiz-
               ing principle of classical narrative forms like biography,
               romance or the “realist” novel must be seen in the light of
               current theories of the plurality of the text. This emphasizes
               the process of reading as a constitutive act of the subject. In
               this new textual form, where the rational historical inquiry is
               continually intersected by the lyrical and the personal, the
               subject is at once writer and reader, performer and audience.
               The resonance of the (documented) historical events in the
               subject is made possible by the “private” dimension and in
               turn makes possible the emergence of pathos as a creative
               critical process. The text is produced as and meant to be re-
               ceived as the intersecting of the personal and the social, a
               process articulated dialectically on subjective codes and on
               objective realities.
               Working along these lines, we can perhaps develop a fem-
               inist theory of textual production which is neither a theory of
               women’s writing nor just a theory of textuality. In other
               words, it is not a matter of finding common elements among
               the texts written or produced by women and defining them in
               terms of a presumed femaleness or femininity which, to my
               mind, is highly suspect of sexual metaphysics; rather, it is
               our task to envision a feminist theory of the process of textual
               production and consumption, which is of course inseparable
               from a theory of culture. In a recently translated article en-
               titled “Is There a Feminine Aesthetic?”, Silvia Bovenscher
               argues that there is no such thing as an ever-present female
               counterculture as such, or a “female nature” outside of his-</p>
            <p>
               torical development; and that to insist on such notions as ir-
               rational perception, cosmic powers or archetypal forms as
               categories for femaleness is at best playing men s games, and
               at worst indulging in reactionary ideologies.11 Since it is the
               specifics of feminine experience and perception that deter-
               mine the form the work takes, we must not accept a priori
               categories and should look for evidence of feminine sensitiv-
               ity in concrete tests. It is good, Bovenschen claims, that no
               formal criteria for “feminine art can be definitively laid
               down. This enables us to reject the notion of artistic norms
               and facile labeling, and prevents cooptation and further ex-
               ploitation of women’s creativity. So it is not a question of
               what or how women write, but of how women produce (as
               makers) and reproduce (as receivers) the aesthetic object, the
               text; in other words, we need a theory of culture with women
               as subjects—not commodities but social beings producing
               and reproducing cultural products, transmitting and trans-
               forming cultural values.12
               In this sense, and so that we can take possession of our cul-
               tural (re)production, 1 think we should assert that women’s
               work is never done.

               extraordinary women who have so much to teach us (even if often they only
               speak of failures and defeat), women still buried under the barren, impious
               ashes of patriarchal history. (Tuttolibri, 17 aprile 1976, p. 4; my transla
               tion). The terms form of content and form of expression come from Louis

               Altman’s recent film, Three Women, seems to me to come close to the latter
               group.

               parallel paths of her choices that bear her in a single direction, the teeth of the comb fit them, for a
               moment the colors appear superfluous to the continuing texture. She twists and resents what is seen as
               beauty arising.
               At another moment sets the red in blocks in such a way that emotion is confused with attention to the
               work, the beating of the comb an essential part. She says of her children, sometimes I work at the
               loom, sometimes they understand. The difference between my life and theirs'’is that my disgust is not

               She is aware at these times that cutting a rug from the loom does not relieve the ongoing pressure.
               She fasts. She does not sleep. The time opens and closes before her movemente. She continues filled
               with a specific calm spreading her hand on the surface of the loom as, beyond the window, the arms of
               trees are empty, precise, to cátchion the curve of them lines of snow. She considers. It is in this spirit
               that she has named children, placing upon them varn and dye in the hope that they will perform rites
               to announce all the phases of their passing.
               And sitting inside the frame she will recast the work, another play of colors whose relations and
               individuals set in her mind the parting of the space. It is time to rewarp the loom; she has come very
               near to the end of the pefmitted period for she has played with the moment here as on other occasions
               she has forced the thread into pláce and had it shy away from her. She again pauses, lingers in the
               empty frame and smiles, having freed herself from the pulling of the hours she,makes perfect
               indifferent gestures at the loom.
               She perceives this stage as a part of a chain, the links placed in her life as an offering. She draws the
               edge in or, pulling the thread taut, settles herself within the rigid sides. She gathers her thoughts, they
               pass into the wool as, when it is spun, scenes from the landscape are twisted into it. She spaces the
               measures, this is one thread wrapped around the frame, rising and sinking always the same like herself
               and days.
               The weavings are all of this thread that eases from her hand a troubled or a sweet excrescence into the
               world. This is her substance in which the moments are caught, their outline fingered and their matter
               consumed in such a way that they themselves become the fiber of the web.

               Political Fabrications: Women’s Textiles in 5 Cultures</p>
            <p>
               We have been meeting collectively for many months, exploring the politi-
               cal dimensions of women’s traditional artmaking. Our focus was on tex-
               tiles and the women who made them from five cultures—Navajo, North-
               west Coast Chilkat Indian, New Zealand Maori, pre-conquest Peruvian
               and Western European. We wanted to clarify relationships between the
               social/political position of women and the status of their textile making in
               these societies.</p>

               Our notion of collectivity began vaguely and was gradually clarified. We wanted to tolerate tensions and individual
               voices. Even though each of us has contributed individually to this effort, what we wrote was the outcome of collec-
               tive debate. This form has had everything to do with our content. Women’s history has been characterized by the
               systematic denial of access to analytic modes of exploring situations. We joined a long tradition of women who
               worked together offering each other support and intimacy. What we intensified was a critical and intellectual dimen-
               sion which became, in time, indistinguishable from the emotional dimension.
               The first part of this piece describes our filters—our articulation of the political dimensions of art and aesthetics and
               our reasons for exploring women’s traditional arts. Our individual explications of women and textiles in five cultures
               follow. We conclude with several theoretical speculations prompted by our research and our collective process.</p>
            <p>
               Toward a definition of the politics of art and aesthetics Women’s traditional art has
               been defined as craft or “low” art. This ascribed status of women’s art is political. To understand why women’s art has been
               considered in this way is a vital political act.
               Aesthetics, theory making about art, has been given to us as though it were value-free, objective and not grounded in a par-
               ticular historical moment. According to us, art and art theories are mediated by those groups who dominate the social sphere
               and have greater access to power. In general, when Westem theorists have reported on traditional societies, their cultural anc
               sexist biases have interfered. Thus, in order to understand what traditional art is, we are forced to state what it is not. It is not
               the work of a formative period of culture, not a late or stagnant phase of development, not the work of children, naives or men-
               tally ill people. It is not technologically crude or inept. Traditional arts have been considered all of these.
               The Western notion of “primitivism” should not be confused with the artistic expression of fully developed cultures of the pre-
               technological world. Within these cultures, although women’s art is skillfully made and present in all aspects of life, it has large-
               ly been ignored by Westem theorists. Its artistic qualities have not been recognized and its possible meanings have not been ex-
               plored.
               Through our research we discovered another bias to be explored. Males within traditional cultures have, because of their politi
               cal and social power, tended to define what is valuable in art. By becoming aware of how biases shape the formulation of
               aesthetic theories, we can reveal the political nature of aesthetics.</p>

               Personal sources for our exploration
               My interest in women’s traditional arts originated in a need to connect personally and historically with women who had the de-
               sire to enrich utilitarian objects. Although relegated to forms of expression bounded by their homes and bodies, women engen-
               dered works informed by an analytic and intuitive but not a High Art sensibility. I wanted to understand why the creative ex-
               pression of women was usually channeled into crafts. Because I felt so connected to these works of art, 1 questioned that
               designation altogether. In particular, 1 wanted to look behind the ephemeral appearance of lace to see what answers and par-
               adoxes would be there.</p>

            <p>
               Because I am still struggling with the myth of male superiority in art, 1 was instinctively drawn to a women’s art form which em-
               bodied a sensual, visual beauty. My incentive to investigate these textiles was generated by the barrenness which characterizes
               the dehumanized products of modern technology. I questioned the place assigned to these domestic, utilitarian objects by male-
               politicized aesthetics. If I could not find validation, I sought at least more factual information regarding their origins and the
               context in which they were made and seen. I came to feel it was necessary to find female antecedents in art and that the lack of a
               woman’s history cuts us off from our own dreams and aspirations. Without a knowledge of our own history, whether in this cul-
               ture or others, we are limited in the extent to which we may excel.

               As an artist in this eclectic age, my interest in women’s traditional arts is filtered through exotic, romantic notions of other
               cultures. 1 am interested in how cultural frameworks affect art and aesthetics. Primitive artists have been described as reflecting
               the style of their culture rather than having an individual style. I wanted to explore that idea with particular reference to wom-
               en. 1 wondered how women’s distance from the power centers of traditional cultures related to their styles of artmaking and
               choices of materials. I questioned whether women artists had as their purpose the expression of their culture’s basic conserva-
               tism or if they sought to change it.

               My earliest responses to the traditional art of women were contradictory. I wanted to celebrate women who, despite natural and
               man-made constraints, have been creative in the transformation of various media. 1 also wanted to understand the historical
               forces that have tried to colonize women’s fantasies, limiting them in their choice of media, iconography and access to an audi-
               ence, and how these limitations have related to restrictions in other spheres of their lives. A historical understanding of women
               and art is prerequisite to a meaningful encounter with the contemporary culture of women.

               Studying women’s artmaking in traditional societies, I had a sense that certain core needs were fulfilled by many kinds of activ-
               ities, whether or not the product of these activities was called art or craft. Both categories seem to embody these needs—man-
               ual/tactile, conceptual, creative/transformative—in the making as well as the experiencing of these objects. “Icing” a canvas or
               icing a cake, shaping a bowl or painting flesh, weaving a blanket or looking to that blanket as inspiration, can all be seen as ex-
               
               amples of these needs in practice.

               Peru
               In Peru textiles were produced as early as 2500 B.C. They served as
               the major vehicle for abstract social and religious expression until the end of the Inca
               state in 1532 A.D. Textile styles developed throughout the successive Peruvian cultures
               of Paracas, Chavin, Nazca, Tiahuanaco-Wari, Chimu and Inca, and continue today.
               For almost 5,000 years, until the Spanish conquest, Peruvian textiles enjoyed an
               uninterrupted freedom from foreign influence. Thus a clear, strong indigenous style
               evolved.
               Most accounts attribute this activity to women by implicit assumption, not stating it
               as actual fact, which suggests that to formally attribute to women a cultural legacy of
               such artistry and expertise is to go out on a limb and to risk being dismissed as biased
               and unscholarly. One prominent authority, in a classic essay on Peruvian textiles, indi-
               cates the weaver’s sex only once by using the pronoun “she” to clarify a sentence at the
               end of the article’s seventeen pages. However, reports and excavated artifacts exist circa 1400 A.D.</p>

               which confirm that Peruvian spinning and weaving was predominantly a woman’s art.
               Spindles, pottery and cloth dolls portraying women weavers (sometimes with a male
               overseer) have been found at gravesites. Early Spanish chronicles and contemporary
               accounts also describe women’s prevalent role as weavers.
               The sandy soil and dry climate of coastal Peru have preserved ancient textiles well.
               Despite extremely simple technology the level of manufacture was very high, with varia-
               tions impossible to duplicate today on machine-powered looms. Peruvian spinners could
               produce yarn of great fineness and consistency, measuring 1/250th of an inch in
               diameter, thus enabling the weaver to produce a textile as tightly woven as 250 threads
               per inch. These women dealt with more than a simple grid structure. Technical ingenu-
               ity was shown in the variety of twined, embroidered and knitted threads creating rich
               surfaces and detailed motifs. Patterning began about 1800 B.C. with the techniques of
               brocade, tapestry, double-cloth and pattern weave being invented and often brilliantly
               combined. Subtle and varied color combinations from vegetable and mineral dyes
               existed from Paracas times onward.
               Early cotton fabrics made by weft-twining were replaced when a loom with heddles
               was introduced which expanded an annual production to tens of thousands of square
               meters of textile and implemented the use of llama, alpaca and vicuna wool. Despite
               their basic rectilinear shape, weavings were put to uses as varied as ponchos, mantles,
               wall hangings and mummy wrappings. As much as 200 pounds of textiles, depending on
               the person’s wealth, were accumulated for burials. In life as well as in death, possession
               of fine textiles symbolized status. Sex, age, marital status and occupation were also
               signified by wearing textiles of a certain color, size, material or motif.
               Accounts after the Incan empire was conquered chronicled textiles’ social
               significance. A wife’s desirability was measured by the quality of her weaving. Wives of
               one household would compete as to who embroidered the best blanket. At Incan wed-
               dings husbands gave brides a fine cloth to indicate their joint control of the new
               household. Incan initiations required four clothing changes, to be woven in a single day
               by the initiate’s mother and sisters.
               A textile’s sacred quality was heightened by the compression and “density” of energy
               in the garments being transferred to the wearer. Incan shrines of venerated female
               ancestors included their spindles, handfuls of cotton and unfinished webs of tapestry as
               offerings or for keeping fingers busy in the next world. These tools were protected in
               case of an eclipse, when it was thought a comet would destroy the moon, a female sym-
               bol. The spindles would then be in danger of turning into snakes, the looms into bears
               and jaguars.
               Throughout Peru’s history, the distinguished quality of tapestry tunics, mantles and
               diaphanous gauzes made part-time weaving unlikely for those engaged in multiple
               household duties. This indicates the existence of a class of specialist spinners, dyers and
               weavers. All peasants under the Incan empire were required to work and weave for state
               needs during two-thirds of the year. At first both men and women spun and wove to
               satisfy their obligation to the state. Houses were organized for specialized guilds called
               the aklla, weaving or “chosen” women. Aged or infirm men, exempted from mitta,
               labor services, made ropes, slings, nets or sacks.
               Under Spanish colonialism any artisan manufacture competing with goods of the
               mother country was initially suppressed. The Spanish introduced a new weaving tech-
               nology. Today men still use medieval Spanish looms, while Andean women hand spin
               and weave on indigenous looms and follow original patterns, although their weavings
               lack the earlier intricacy and subtlety. Factory-produced textiles are also manufactured.
               A strong textile workers’ federation in the 1940s defended the rights of women, despite
               the fact that female suffrage was not legal until 1955. This union caused Peru to be the
               only country with a large textile industry to legally prohibit sex discrimination in wages.
               The history of Peru documents a long tradition of superlative textile art made by
               women. These works emerged as the product of traditional cultural values. Peruvian
               weavers were ingenious and dexterous; they utilized natural materials sensitively in
               what now seems a simpler and temporally slower reality. Within a society with rigidly
               defined sex roles, women lacked many options. Weaving paradoxically served to focus
               their vision and allowed their inner resources to be realized. Complexity and beauty
               glow in the work, which resists grandiosity as false and alien. These works, in which
               women wrapped and shaped the history of Peru, are true to themselves.

            <p>
               New Zealand Maori
               In the beginning,
               Rangi-nui (sky father) and Papa-tua-nuku (earth mother) embraced. Their love pro-
               duced 70 supernatural beings who, embodied in natural phenomena, were everyday
               deities. Tane, the oldest child, convinced his brothers and sisters to force their parents
               apart so that the earth could have light. In this way he became the god of light and took
               the form of the sun. Tane wanted to create a race of mortals for the earth, and he began
               a wide search for uha, the female element. In his wandering, he reached the twelfth
               heaven where he sought the aid of 1o, supreme god. lo’s attendants sent him to
               Kurawaka, the pubic region of his mother Papa. There he created a woman from mud
               and earth, breathing on the inanimate figure until she came to life.
               Such myths simultaneously reflected and created the status and treatment of women
               in New Zealand Maori society. Man was considered the sacred provider of life-giving
               elements while woman was regarded as his profane, passive receptacle; men were
               associated with life and strength, women with death and destruction. Female reproduc-
               tive organs were called the “house of misfortune and disaster.” Distinctions between
               men and women colored every aspect of life in Maori society: the right side of the body
               was male and vital, the left female and degraded. These designations had tactical
               implications in battle and were used to explain good and bad fortune. Women were ex-
               cluded from access to esoteric knowledge and ceremonial rituals because they were not
               tapu (sacred). Only highborn men could become tohunga (priests) and only tohunga
               knew Io. Women knew only lo’s familiar manifestations. Nevertheless, women had
               their own rituals: they greeted the reappearance of certain constellations—Pleiades
               (Maori new year) and Canopus (first frost)—with song and dance. The moon, regarded
               by women as their true husband, was similarly welcomed.
               A distinct sexual division of labor began after birth when children were dedicated to
               masculine and feminine roles. When the sacredness of an activity might be destroyed by
               the presence of women, these tasks were done by men. When the sacredness of men
               might be degraded by doing certain tasks, these were done by women. In practice, this
               meant that men’s tasks were physically dangerous and seen as challenging: hunting,
               open-sea fishing, tattooing and carving wood and greenstone. Women’s tasks followed
               the rhythm of domesticity: collecting food, water and firewood, cultivating and pre-
               paring flax, weaving and offering hospitality through singing and dancing.
               Women’s decorative impulse found form in the taniko designed borders of the cloaks
               they wove. Weaving was the last stage in a complicated, arduous, even painful process
               which began with the cultivation of flax and continued through the scraping, plaiting,
               pounding and rolling of flax fibers into twine. Girl children learned early that they were
               destined to become weavers. As babies, their first thumb joint was bent outwards in
               anticipation of certain tasks. As children, they played to the accompaniment of ditties
               like: “The woman with nimble hands and feet, marry her; The woman who chatters,
               cast her out” and “Who will marry a woman too lazy to weave garments?
               By the age of nine or ten, girls began complex and ritualized training. They were
               made tapu through a ritual, sitting inactive while a male instructor recited a charm.
               They were then instructed to bite into the upper part of the right weaving stick which
               was tapu (masculine). Until their first sampler was finished, they were not allowed to
               communicate with anyone other than the priest or instructor. Eating sow thistle
               removed the tapu.
               Flax was woven on primitive looms consisting of two sticks in the ground. Taniko
               elements included triangles, chevrons, diamonds and hourglass shapes; the predomi-
               nant colors were red, black, white and yellow. Feathers were used decoratively in the
               weaving of garments, kiwi feathers being highly valued, parrot feathers adding bright
               color. Since they were inserted as the garment was woven, the overall pattern had to be
               kept in mind. Sometimes, hard strips of flax were curled into tubular forms and hung
               from a band. This produced a rattling sound during dancing, serving as the unique per-
               cussive instrument in Maori culture.
               Carving was forbidden to women; weaving was open to men. Women used only the
               taniko patterns in their decoration. Men used the taniko patterns in carving a single
               wallboard (heke tipi) high above the house porch, but typical male iconography directly
               represented feared or revered aspects of their environment: stylized human figures,
               mythic long-tongued sea monsters, lizards and ancestors. Even the more abstract male
               patterns were related to such elements in their surroundings as sea waves, hammerhead
               sharks, ferns and sand flounder.</p>

               Both male and female designs were subject to strict rules;
               although there were accepted evaluative criteria such as sym-
               metry, rhythm and dramatic use of color, designs were not
               copied and within formal constraints originality was ex-
               pected. Although choices of material and iconography were
               socially defined for both sexes, men enjoyed more latitude. If
               art is that which approximates the autonomous, then there
               was a curious freedom in the restricted iconography of wom-
               en, since the abstract elements of taniko were not reality
               dictated. But men could use taniko too. Since they also had
               access to schools of weaving, even if they rarely exercised the
               option, role flexibility was greater for them. Men’s political
               and religious power enabled them to structure language and
               assign values in Maori society. The actual reciprocity on
               which the society was based was not acknowledged. Maori
               mythology reinforced the ideology of male superiority which
               devalued the tasks and art produced by women.

               The Chilkat Norh ot Oregon,
               south of Alaska, is a coastal area abundant with game, fish
               and vegetation. Here in the late 18th and 19th centuries lived
               a subgroup of the Tlingit tribe—the Chilkats. Their neigh-
               bors were the Tshimshian, Kwakiutl and Haida, with whom
               they traded, fought and intermarried.
               Basic survival needs could be met with relative ease among
               the Chilkats because of the lush environment. The Chilkat
               society was a chiefdom, based economically on the redistri-
               bution of goods within a network of family groups linkeo
               through matrilineal descent. Resources were owned com-
               munally, while special highly decorated objects were accum-
               ulated to give prestige to heads of the individual clans.
               Among these objects was a type of shawl or robe, popularly
               referred to as a “blanket.
               The story is told that a Chilkat bride of a Tshimshian chief
               learned the art of making cedarbark dance aprons and leg-
               gings. When she died, a dance apron was sent home to her
               relatives, who unraveled it in order to understand how it was
               made. They began then to make blankets in the same fash-
               ion, although eventually they became far better-known as
               weavers than the Tshimshian.
               Blankets were woven with yarn spun from mountain-goat
               wool with a core of yellow cedarbark twine. Men hunted the
               goats and made the half-loom ; Women spun and dyed the
               yarn black, blue, yellow and white from hemlock, copper
               and vegetable dyes. In all instances women were the weav-
               ers. They set up the loom and tied off the warp bundles to
               form a shallow curve along the lower edge of the blanket.
               While in certain cases they copied patterns painted on boards
               by men, in others they designed their own weaving patterns.
               There were two distinct styles of Chilkat blankets. The
               first was abstract with chevrons, stripes, enclosing borders
               and squares. This was the women’s style. The second, the
               men s'style, was representational using signs or symbols for
               man, animals and water life.
               The abstract and representational styles shared many
               characteristics. In addition to the unique curved shape of the
               lower edge, the visual field in both is highly active and
               extremely dense, although the mode of expression looks dis-
               similar.
               The male-style blankets reflected men’s foraging activities
               through bilateral symmetry and x-ray and transparent por-
               trayals of animal motifs. The blanket, organized by a central</p>

               panel and two flanking sides, was itself like a flayed animal
               skin. Because of the Chilkat’s desire for design density, the
               overlay of motifs sometimes made interpretation of the blan-
               kets difficult, if not impossible. The animal characteristics
               portrayed were often determined by a dream that the male
               artist or the patron had. As designers of the representational
               blankets, men brought their dreamlife into the waking world
               as a record of their encounters with the supernatural. We
               have no such record of the women’s dreams.
               Women were prohibited from creating designs involving
               life forms, so that while simultaneously producing men’s
               blankets, women wove their own using a purely abstract de-
               sign system. Variation of visual elements, contrast of yarn
               color and variety of texture created blankets with strong
               graphic and sensual impact. The geometric patterns with
               alternating areas of linear density created a rhythmic varia-
               tion which broke the uniformity of the field. Design in the
               women’s style was even denser than in the men’s. By filling
               the space from edge to edge, the weavers virtually eliminated
               any illusion of shallow planar recession. Instead, they cre-
               ated an advancing plane by the addition of wool and bark
               fringes protruding from the body of the robes which empha-
               sized the flatness and frontality of the surface conception.
               Instead of the dreamlike meditations implied in the men’s
               blankets, the female style was at once more accessible and
               more reserved: accessible through the emphasis on the physi-
               cality of the textile, reserved because of the impenetrability</p>

               of the design. Because of the limited number of design ele
               ments, the variation of combinations gave richness to the
               weavings. Just as the women were not at the center of the
               power hierarchy of the Chilkat clans, their art did not rely on
               signs central to the culture. The limited motifs available to
               women were indicative of the women’s position in relation to
               the status quo, the fabric out of which the blankets were
               created.
               Both men’s and women’s blankets were highly valued and
               were used in a variety of ceremonies. Given as dowry, along
               with songs, dances and titles, they were commonly made for
               the potlatch. Potlatch was integral to Chilkat life. These
               were competitive ceremonies involving the distribution and
               destruction of wealth. Blankets were often cut up and hand-
               ed round or burned in vast quantities of salmon oil. Guests
               sometimes collected pieces of blankets they received as gifts
               and later reassembled them into new blankets, shirts or
               dance aprons. In this way they created collage motifs and
               symbols. The recipient was obliged to pay back the gift, pref-
               erably with interest. Blankets therefore were a currency of
               obligation. The Chilkats based their interpersonal relations
               on desire for power and control, intense competition coupled
               with a philosophy of conspicuous consumption. The many
               social ceremonies in which the Chilkats demonstrated these
               characteristics created an unending demand for prestigious
               art objects, like the blankets. At some point in their history
               the Chilkats began to support professional artists to meet
               these needs. Partly as a result of the desire to consume or
               destroy costly items, the Chilkats valued objects that were
               very difficult to produce. The intricacy of the men’s style
               blanket patterns made them more highly valued than the
               women’s style; these considerations were central to the Chil-
               kat ideas of aesthetic appreciation.

               in blankets by hunting and mytho-
               ver, even though the women’s style did

               emol
               te the same access to the culture’s core con-
               cerns, their blankets were highly regarded. The competitive
               give-aways which commissioned the prestige-laden blankets
               of both styles raised the weavers’ status. As European con-
               tact increased, European standards infiltrated the Chilkat
               community and affected the production of female-style blan-
               kets. The increased demand for representational blankets,
               sought after for their unique yet recognizable images, limited
               the time the weavers had to produce their own type of textile.
               It is partly as a result of this influence that the female-style
               Chilkat blankets have received so little attention.

               Spider Woman instructed the Navajo women how to weave on a loom. The warp was
               of spider web. There were crosspoles of sky and earth cords, warp sticks of sun rays, and healds of rock crystal and
               sheet lightning. The batten was sun halo, and white shell made the comb. The four spindles were of flash lightning
               with a whorl of turquoise, lightning with a whorl of abalone, a rain streamer with a whorl of white shell and zigzag
               lightning with a whorl of coal.

            <p>
               l’he Navajos explained the origins of weaving through the myth of Spider Woman. As an art form weaving reflected a changing
               Navajo culture and therefore serves as a valuable and permanent record. Through their vigorous design and color, and the
               technical skill involved, Navajo blankets expressed women’s vision and artistry.
               Blankets were woven for many needs, but were essentially used for clothing and warmth. Their other uses were as bedding, sad-
               dle blankets and floor coverings for sitting. They were also used as doorways to Navajo homes, called hogans. The blankets
               were secular, not ceremonial, textiles through which the women expressed a strong personal connection to the people using
               them. Blankets represented, and perhaps symbolized through their design, the life of the wearer. When worn, the blanket s
               linear design emphasized the verticality of a standing person. The wearing of blankets enlivened the environment, not only
               visually, but also through the symbolic meanings of color. To the Navajo red meant Blessed Sunshine, white the East or Morn-
               ing Light, blue the South which was cloudless, yellow the West or the Sunset and black the North where dark clouds originated.
               Combinations evoked naturalistic images. For example, black vertical lines might represent rain, and on a yellow background,
               the rain in the evening sky. Women followed certain traditional forms, but each weaver made her own interpretation and wove
               the blanket herself. Individuality of the blankets was highly regarded; each weaver’s ideas and feelings could be expressed in
               unique designs which were never repeated.
               In Navajo society women historically have been greatly respected and thought the equal of men. Deep religiosity and mythology
               permeated daily life, explaining natural phenomena and daily tasks, and creating their history. Woman was deified in Navajo
               mythology as Changing Woman, a central figure who designed the hogans. By hanging her blankets as a doorway and designat
               ing their colors as those of “Dawn, Sky Blue, Evening Twilight, and Darkness,” women connected the domestic, natural anc
               religious spheres, a synthesis typical of Navajo life structure. Women headed the separate family units and managed thei
               economic affairs. In this matrilineal society women’s participation in rituals and in political activities was considered essential.
               Their chores included cooking, sewing, caring for the house and children, gathering wood, hauling water, butchering livestock
               and herding the sheep from which they prepared the wool for their weaving. This preparation included shearing the wool anc</p>

               carding, spinning and dyeing it. Frequently women built their own looms, which were set up outside in summer and inside the
               hogan in winter. Looms were made of logs placed vertically and could be dismantled for transport from summer to winter graz-
               ing grounds. The women designed and wove their blankets, without prior drawings, as their time and chores allowed.
               The earliest-known examples of the Navajo blanket date from 1805. However, the first Navajos who migrated to the Southwest
               United States in 1000 A.D. probably used tree and bark fibers. It was not until the fifteenth century, when Spanish livestock
               was brought to the neighboring Pueblo Indians, that Navajo weaving changed significantly. Through trade and raids the Nava-
               jo got sheep which provided the women with softer threads and the varying colors of natural fleece. Exposure to the weaving
               techniques of the Pueblos in the late seventeenth century influenced Navajo weavers to experiment with new techniques and
               develop a style of alternating bands of natural wool colors.
               As dyes and yarns were obtained through trade, new colors began to be used. One of the earliest colors was a red whose source
               was the unraveled, respun and rewoven threads of an English fabric called “bayeta,” imported by the Spaniards and traded to
               the Pueblos. Because of their complexity and technical skill these “bayeta” blankets were reknowned among the Spanish and
               other tribes. To own a Navajo blanket was considered a sign of honor.
               Stylistic changes also occurred after contact with North American culture. In the 1860s the Navajos fought with and finally sur-
               rendered to Kit Carson at Fort Sumner, where they were imprisoned for four years. Although conditions there were not good,
               the Navajos assimilated many new influences. One of the dominant and most startling styles to come out of this period was the
               “Eye-Dazzler,” so called for its interplay of expressive pattern and vivid color. This style, as well as others, showed the weaver’s
               mastery in its finely spun wool, even and tightly woven texture, boldness and energy of design and subtlety in its skillful han-
               dling and control. In relation to this highly developed artistic decísion-making Gladys Reichard, in Weaving a Navajo Blanket,
               speaks of the weaver Atlnaba who “spends hours experimenting with the colors at her command . . . She may discard a dozen
               greens and yellows before she accepts one.
               Men and women in Navajo society used different aesthetic systems to filter and express their perceptions. Men’s art, unlike the
               women’s, was religious. Sand paintings, whose powers were guarded in secret and destroyed after the ritual, used figurative im-
               agery to summon the spirits and gain vicarious control over nature. Women’s art, however, was visible in everyday use. Women
               employed a nonfigurative and abstract imagery, powerfully reflecting the desert landscape in which the Navajo lived, a land-
               scape of horizontality, expansiveness, drama and vivid color. The strength of their aesthetic language and the power of its ex-
               pressiveness reveal the great pride Navajo women felt in their social and economic importance and the value of their activities.

               Lacemakers ol
               Wearing and making lace was important
               in Europe from the sixteenth through the
               nineteenth centuries. Lace appears to us
               today as a delicate and innocent fabric.
               The world in which it existed was fai
               from innocent, and despite its appear-
               ance, lace and its history illustrate this
               Like other luxuries, most lace could be
               had only by the wealthy. The womer
               who made it rarely benefited from it
               While their products were coveted, they
               worked under poor and sometimes haz-
               ardous conditions. As symbols of status,
               laces left the humble homes of lacemak-
               ers to enter a world removed from their
               lives.
               
               The two most highly prized laces were
               Panel of Venetian bobbi
               “needlepoint, which depended entirely
               on the buttonhole stitch, and “bobbin,
               in which thread was
               woven, twisted and braided around bobbins. These laces were
               made by women of all classes. Wealthier women made it for
               recreation and because it befitted their roles as “cultivated
               ladies.” Poorer women made it to sell. Lace made for personal
               use contained any design of the woman’s imagination and
               cultural heritage. Motifs included fantastical animals, birds,
               human figures or religious scenes or symbols. Designs for com-
               merce were more limited. They were usually created by male
               patternmakers according to prevailing fashion, although com-
               mercial lacemakers’ own interpretations were also highly
               valued. Each country and region had indigenous designs, but
               if lacemakers moved to new areas, they took their patterns and
               drawings with them. Many towns were financially dependent
               on this female industry despite the low wages paid.
               The process of making lace was painstaking and required
               close scrutiny. The thread was so fine that complicated means
               were necessary to magnify it. Many lacemakers went blind by
               the time they were thirty. Every effort was made to keep the
               lace clean and delicate, mostly at the expense of the lace-
               maker’s health. Öften thread spinning and lacemaking were
               done in damp cellars to prevent the thread from becoming brit
               tle and breaking. In winter lacemakers worked in lofts above
               cowsheds for warmth so that the lace was kept away from</p>
            <p>
               Western Europe
               smokey fireplaces. Its production was
               time-consuming; a woman could spend
               a whole year on a single piece of Valen-
               ciennes. In 1855 Napoleon III ordered
               a dress for Princess Eugenie which took
               36 women 18 months to complete. Even
               when not involved in such ambitious
               projects, women might spend 12 to 15
               hours each day making lace.
               Lace was produced in whole pieces or
               in parts depending on the design. Mak
               ing separate parts entailed a division of
               labor determined by specialization and
               skill. Some women were better at mak-
               ing the ground net, others at filling in
               the flowers, etc. The most skilled
               worker assembled the entire piece
               the 17thc
               To sell their work, lacemakers were
               immersed in a cumbersome commercial process, called the
               “facteur” or middleman system. A commercial house
               (manufacturer) was represented by a facteur who, acting as
               its agent, supplied lacemakers with patterns and raw mater-
               ials on credit. Finished pieces were then sold to the facteur
               who in turn resold them to the manufacturer. There was lit-
               tle or no contact between lacemakers and manufacturers.
               Facteurs were usually women—former lacemakers who
               could supervise other lacemakers and who were counted on
               to drive a hard bargain for the manufacturer. Since lace-
               makers were totally dependent on facteurs for their work and
               raw material, they were unable to bargain for better pay or
               working conditions. Their only other option was to become
               facteurs. The contradiction of this system is that through
               personal advancement the women who became facteurs
               helped to perpetuate the exploitation of their former peers.
               For artistocratic women instruction in lacemaking pre-
               pared them for futures as “noble ladies.” Poor girls were
               taught at home, in convents or in charitable institutions.
               Convents established apprenticeships where girls began thein
               training at five and by ten were able to earn their keep. They
               were taught lacemaking not to master an art but to make a
               living. Women of both classes were denied the opportunity to
               direct their own lives. The notion that women were suited to</p>

               work which required patience and perseverance directly re-
               sulted from the constraints imposed upon them by society.
               Ironically most lacemakers did not benefit from the beauty
               and romance of lace. In addition, their products became
               symbols in a world in which they did not participate. Lace
               was highly valued by the rich because it represented their po-
               sition in society. Men boasted about how much land their
               lace was worth; they appeared in ballrooms wearing as much
               of it as they could. Women wore it as a reflection of their hus-
               bands’ or fathers’ wealth. Lace became a nationalistic em
               blem. Countries were highly competitive in its display and
               production. Monarchs decreed that only their favorite native
               laces could appear in court. Edicts were proclaimed banning
               the use of foreign laces to protect home industries and black
               markets involving smuggling and kidnapping developed to
               undermine these laws. When lace designs were traded, they
               were secretly guarded. When Belgium tried to prevent the
               theft of lace imported from France, these designs were so cut
               up when distributed to lacemakers that their entirety was un-
               known to any individual woman. It was feared that a lace-
               maker would attempt to smuggle or to sell the design.
               Lace made by women for personal use was often kept by
               their families which also preserved the memory of the
               lacemakers. Lace made to sell was and is perceived as anony-
               mous. Although most lacemakers remain unknown to us,
               their art is silent witness to the arduous and creative work
               which was their tradition.

               Speculations
               Because art, its cre-
               ation and the theories surrounding it are political, we have
               placed the textile art made by women in traditional societies
               into a cultural context, instead of simply considering the ar-
               tifacts. We have explored aspects of women s art in each of
               five cultures, relating them to women’s broader social iden-
               tities. Our assumption that art dialectically reflects and con-
               tributes to the creation of society was basic to our study and
               revealed in our research.
               Peruvian textiles were viewed as sacred; as such, women
               making them performed this task as a ceremonial act of crea-
               tion. Textiles reflected status within Peruvian culture, mak-
               ing the weavers responsible for visibly defining differences of
               rank
               In Maori society women were considered nonsacred and
               socially inferior. Activities like wood and greenstone carving
               were forbidden to them. It was possible for men, on the other
               hand, to weave and use women’s designs, although they
               usually undertook women’s tasks only as instructors in weav-
               ing schools where they initiated girls into the ritual, tech-
               nique and aesthetics of weaving.
               In Chilkat society, rank and privilege were inherited ma
               trilineally, but women did not really own the titles passed
               down to them by birthright. Instead, titles were given by
               women’s fathers to their husbands at the time of marriage
               The distinctions of female/male status can also be seen in
               relation to blanket making. While men designed the repre-
               sentational blankets, women executed their designs. Despite
               a certain lack of legitimate power, women exerted covert
               power as weavers by inserting disruptive motifs into the
               spaces on and between male mythological designs. More im-
               portantly, women designed and wove blankets which were
               also highly valued by their culture, although not representa-
               tional in style.
               Women in Navajo society were well respected. Their
               responsibilities and powers were equal to those of men.
               Though it was possible for women to participate in the mak-
               ing of religious art, they rarely did so, preferring to maintain
               the female tradition of weaving. Their weaving used strong
               abstract imagery. Their textiles were highly valued both in-
               side and outside the tribe.
               Class differences in Western Europe affected the produc-</p>
            <p>
               tion of lace. Wealthy women made it as part of their required
               repertoire of ladylike leisure accomplishments. Poor women
               made it for a living. Paradoxically, this afforded them a cer-
               tain autonomy that richer women did not achieve, but this
               autonomy did not extend to conceptual control over commer-
               cial lace design.
               Because our research has focused on particular aspects of
               five cultures, we are not making universal claims. Rather we
               have explored alternative ways of looking at and trying to
               understand women and their products. These have included:
               •working collectively in our research, discussions and
               writing;
               equestioning our information sources, particularly in
               terms of their andro- and ethnocentrism;
               •articulating our own filters, consistent with our conten-
               tion that objectivity in research or interpretation is
               neither possible nor even desirable.
               We came to our project curious, confused, angry that even
               within the already denigrated category of “traditional art,
               women’s objects had often been overlooked or misrepre-
               sented. We were ready to be sympathetic to the women
               whose objects had attracted us to this research in the first
               place.
               But we wanted to avoid merely replacing one set of distort-
               ing biases for another. We wanted to understand our curios-
               ity, clarify our confusion, find the sources of our anger with-
               out anachronistically using contemporary Western notions
               like oppression of women to explain sex hierarchies. We
               were wary of our sympathy for the objects and their makers
               and did not wish to impose a simple translation of Western
               definitions of art on to societies where art had a very different
               meaning. All the speculations that follow should be read in
               the context of these qualifications.
               There is a contradictory freedom in the abstract style of
               women s art in some of these cultures (Maori, Chilkat,
               Navajo). Women’s iconography did not directly function in
               the service of male religion and therefore was not subservient
               to male mythology. The abstractness” of women’s art has
               to be questioned. Men, investigating New Zealand Maori
               male design, have taken great pains to discover that, though
               abstract, this iconography is an exaggerated stylization of
               natural objects in the Maori environment. Yet the literature</p>

               on women’s styles denies that their abstractions also have
               meaning. Chilkat men designed their dreams into the blan-
               kets woven by their women. Because their symbols have
               been interpreted more than the designs of the women does
               not negate the possibility that female abstractions have
               symbolic meaning too. That the making of Navajo blankets
               was embedded in the myth of Spider Woman and that their
               colors and designs call to mind so evocatively the atmosphere
               of the Navajo environment suggest the possibility of a latent
               symbolism.
               Even the claim that men have often tended to be the
               designers and women the makers (of Chilkat blankets, of
               lace) cannot be accepted at face value. In the Chilkat society
               women challenged the constraints imposed by male designers
               by inserting their own motifs. By the time lacemaking had
               become an industry men were the acknowledged designers,
               although the industry drew on the long tradition of cottage
               lacemaking. Women had been sovereign over the whole pro-
               cess, and undoubtedly many designs had their origins in
               what women had been creating for centuries.
               Though our focus has been on the female/male contradic-
               tion, other forms of stratification existed in Peruvian, Maori,
               Chilkat and European society. Status distinctions separated
               women from each other as well as women from men. Lace
               was made in the context of early capitalism in which old
               feudal distinctions between the high and low born were giv
               ing way to class structures. As lace was produced for com-
               merce, the opportunity for some poor women to become
               facteurs developed. This created additional inequalities in
               income and status between lacemakers. In Maori society the
               advantages of being a puhi or woman aristocrat (more elab-
               orate clothing, ornamentation, responsibilities for organizing
               entertainment) were tempered by restrictions, particularly
               on her sexual freedom, her choice of husband and lovers.
               The Chilkat social structure was stratified into chiefs, com-
               moners and slaves; women occupied all three ranks. As has
               been discussed, though rank was matrilineally inherited, the
               women who owned titles tended, in turn, to be the property
               of men. The Navajo society, where women enjoyed equality
               with men and there was mutual respect between the sexes,
               was not hierarchical. Apparently the more stratified a society</p>

               is and the more its production depends on the existence of
               castes and classes, the more likely it is that women in gen-
               eral, and women in less prestigious groups in particular, will
               be designated inferior in practice, ideology and myth.
               What strikes us is that despite the potential of traditional
               social structures to muffle and distort the artistic expression
               of women, the effect on women’s artmaking was contradic-
               tory. Conceptualizaton was separated from execution of de-
               sign in Chilkat and Peruvian societies and, most extremely.
               among employed lacemakers in Westemn Europe. The range
               of media and motifs available to women was restricted in
               Maori and Chilkat societies, and women’s art was designat-
               ed as nonreligious in societies such as the Navajo and Maori
               where religion was valued. Despite these limitations, wom-
               en s textiles asserted themselves as beautiful art objects. Out
               of this contradiction women invented a varied abstract visual
               language. We are not attempting to resolve that contradic-
               tion, which is a real one. It is not our point that the objects
               women made were, or need to be, judged qualitatively as
               equal, inferior or superior to those of men. What we are say-
               ing is that we do not subscribe to these categorizations.
               We cannot neglect the contexts, both real and ideological,
               in which women s art has been made. Our critique questions
               the social and political structures which created and perpetu-
               ated discriminating hierarchies. By looking at traditional so-
               cieties through our Western, female eyes, we can acknowl-
               edge the biased quality of our interpretations. We can also
               see how contemporary biases were anticipated by the dis-
               criminatory attitudes toward women characteristic of the
               cultures we have investigated.
               We take for granted that women’s self-expression in tex-
               tiles was artistic expression. Social structures and supporting
               mythologies did have the potential to thwart creative needs
               of women. What was important was women’s ability to
               break codes, to play with format and to transcend limita-
               tions. Women often had to subvert societal dictates in order
               to gain access to a fundamental human need—that of artistic
               self-expression. Any attempt to deny this need is a painful
               form of oppression. That women in traditional societies have
               been resourceful and spirited in challenging this must be
               celebrated.</p>

               ZIs feminists and artists exploring the decorative in our own paintings, we were curious about the pe-
               jorative use of the word “decorative” in the contemporary art world. In rereading the basic texts of
               Modern Art, we came to realize that the prejudice against the decorative has a long history and is based on
               hierarchies: fine art above decorative art, Western art above non-Western art, men’s art above women’
               art. By focusing on these hierarchies we discovered a disturbing belief system based on the moral super
               iority of the art of Western civilization.
               We decided to write a piece about how language has been used to communicate this moral superiority
               Certain words have been handed down unexamined from one generation to the next. We needed to take
               these words away from the art context to examine and decode them. They have colored our own history
               our art training. We have had to rethink the underlying assumptions of our education.
               Within the discipline of art history, the following words are continuously used to characterize what has
               been called “high art”: man, mankind, the individual man, individuality, humans, humanity, the human
               figure, humanism, civilization, culture, the Greeks, the Romans, the English, Christianity, spirituality,
               transcendence, religion, nature, true form, science, logic, purity, evolution, revolution, progress, truth,
               freedom, creativity, action, war, virility, violence, brutality, dynamism, power and greatness.
               In the same texts other words are used repeatedly in connection with so-called “low art”: Africans,
               Orientals, Persians, Slovaks, peasants, the lower classes, women, children, savages, pagans, sensuality,
               pleasure, decadence, chaos, anarchy, impotence, exotica, eroticism, artifice, tattoos, cosmetics, ornament,
               decoration, carpets, weaving, patterns, domesticity, wallpaper, fabrics and furniture.
               All of these words appear in the quotations found throughout this piece. The quotations are from the
               writings and statements of artists, art critics and art historians. We do not pretend to neutrality and do not
               supply the historical context for the quotations. These can be found in the existing histories of Modern Art.
               Our analysis is based on a personal, contemporary perspective.</p>

               WAR AND VIRILITY
               Manifestoes of Modern Art often ex-
               hort artists to make violent, brutal
               work, and it is no accident that men
               such as Hirsh, Rivera, and Picasso like
               to think of their art as a metaphorical
               weapon. One of the longstanding tar
               gets of this weapon has been the decor
               ative. The scorn for decoration epito-
               mizes the machismo expressed by Le
               Corbusier, Gabol Pevsner and Marin-
               etti/Sant’Elia. Their belligerence may
               take the form of an appeal to the ma
               chine aesthetic: the machine is idolized
               as a tool and symbol of progress, anc
               technological progress is equated with
               reductivist, streamlined art. The in
               stinct to purify exalts an order which is
               never described and condemns a chaos
               which is never explained.</p>

               PURITY
               In the polemics of Modern Art, pur-
               ity represents the highest good. The
               more the elements of the work of art are
               pared down, reduced, the more visible
               the purity. Here Greenberg equates
               reductivism with rationality and func-
               tion. But it is never explained why or
               for whom art has to be functional, nor
               why reductivism is rational. Among
               artists as diverse as Sullivan, Ozenfant
               and de Kooning, we found the sexual
               metaphor of “stripping down art and
               architecture to make them nude or
               pure. The assumption is that the art-
               ist is male, and the work of art (object)
               female.

               Clement Greenberg, “Detached Ob-
               servations, 1976:
               “The ultimate use of art is construed
               as being to provide the experience of
               aesthetic value, therefore art is to be
               stripped down towards this end.
               Hence, modernist functionalism,
               essentialism’ it could be called, the
               urge to purify’ the medium, any
               medium. Purity’ being construed as
               the most efficacious, efficient,
               economical employment of the me-
               dium for purposes of aesthetic
               value.
               Louis Sullivan, “Ornament in Archi-
               tecture, 1892:
               it would be greatly for our aes-
               thetic good, if we should refrain
               from the use of ornament for a per-
               iod of years, in order that our
               thought might concentrate acutely
               upon the production of buildings
               well formed and comely in the
               nude.</p>
            <p>
               Amédée Ozenfant, Foundation
               Modern Art, 1931:
               “Decoration can be revolting, but a
               naked body moves us by the har-
               mony of its form.
               Willem de Kooning, “What Abstract
               Art Means to Me, 1951:
               “One of the most striking of abstract
               art’s appearance is her nakedness,
               an art stripped bare.</p>
            <p>
               PURITY IN ARTASA
               HOLY CAUSE
               Purity can also be sanctified as an aes-
               thetic principle. Modern artists and
               their espousers sometimes sound like
               the new crusaders, declaring eternal or
               religious values. A favorite theme is
               that of cleansing art. The ecclesiastical
               metaphor of transcendence through
               purification (baptism) is used to uphold
               the “Greek tradition (as in the van de
               Velde quotation) or the “Christian
               tradition (as in the Loos quotation).
               Cleansing and purification are some-
               times paired with an exalted view of the
               artistas a god, as in Apollinaire s' desire
               to “deify personality.

               THE SUPERIORITY OF
               WESTERN ART
               Throughout the literature of Western
               art there are racist assumptions that de-
               value the arts of other cultures. The an-
               cient Greeks are upheld as the model,
               an Aryan ideal of order. Art in the
               Greco-Roman tradition is believed to
               represent superior values. Malraux
               uses the word “barbarian and Fry the
               word savages to describe art and art
               ists outside our tradition. The non-
               Western ideals of pleasure, meditation
               and loss of self are clearly not under-
               stood by the exponents of ego assertion,
               transcendence and dynamism.

               “There scarcely ever was a civilized
               nation of that complexion nor even
               any individual, eminent either in ac-
               tion or speculation. No ingenious
               manufactures amongst them, no
               arts, no ściences.
               Roger Fry, “The Art of the Bush-
               men, 1910:
               “. . . it is to be noted that all the peo-

               we call the lowest of savages, they
               are certainly the least civilizable,
               and the South African Bushmen are
               regarded by other native races in
               much the same way that we look
               upon negroes.
               André Malraux, The Voices of Si-
               lence, 1953:
               “Now a barbarian art can keep alive
               only in the environment of the bar
               barism it expresses . .
               “. .. the Byzantine style, as the West
               saw it, was not the expression of a
               supreme value but merely a form of
               decoration.
               Roger Fry, “The Munich Exhibition
               of Mohammedan Art, 1910:
               “It cannot be denied that in course

               turies B.C. or the Western world
               since the Renaissance, but its flavor
               is unmistakable . . .</p>

               CONTAMINATION,
               IMPOTENCE AND
               DECADENCE
               Racism is the other side of the coin of
               Exotica. Often underlying a fascination
               with the Orient, Indians, Africans and
               primitives is an urgent unspoken fear of
               infiltration, decadence and domination
               by the mongrels gathering impatient-
               ly at the gates of civilization. Ornamen-
               tal objects from other cultures which
               appeared in Europe in the nineteenth
               century were clearly superior to West-
               ern machine-made products. How
               could the West maintain its notion of
               racial supremacy in the face of these
               objects? Loos’s answer: by declaring
               that ornament itself was savage. Artists
               and aesthetes who would succumb to
               decorative impulses were considered
               impotent and/or decadent.

               Adolf Loos, “Ornament and Crime,
               1908:
               “I have made the following discov-
               ery and I pass it on to the world: The
               evolution of culture is synonymous
               with the removal of ornament from
               utilitarian objects. I believed that
               with this discovery I was bringing
               joy to the world; it has not thanked
               me. People were sad and hung their</p>

               heads. What depressed them was the
               realization that they could produce
               no new ornaments. Are we alone, the
               people of the nineteenth century,

               sess no joiner’s benches from the
               Carolingian era, but every trifle that
               displays the least ornament has been
               collected and cleaned and palatial
               buildings have been erected to house
               it. Then people walked sadly about
               between the glass cases and felt
               ashamed of their impotence.
               Amédée Ozenfant, Foundations of
               Modern Art, 1931:
               Let us beware lest the earnest effort
               of younger peoples relegates us to
               the necropolis of the effete nations,
               as mighty Rome did to the dilet
               tantes of the Greek decadence, or
               the Gauls to worn-out Rome.
               “Given many lions and few fleas, the
               lions are in no danger; but when the
               fleas multiply, how pitiful is the
               lions' lot!
               Albert Gleizes and Jean Metzinger,
               Cubism, 1912:
               As all preoccupation in art arises
               from the material employed, we
               ought to regard the decorative pre-
               occupation, if we find it in a painter,
               as an anachronistic artifice, useful
               only to conceal impotence.
               Maurice Barrés (on the Italian pre-
               Renaissance painters), 1897 (quoted
               in André Malraux, The Voices of Si-
               lence):
               And 1 can also see why aesthetes,
               enamored of the archaic, who have
               deliberately emasculated their virile
               emotions in quest of a more fragile
               grace, relish the poverty and petti-
               ness of these minor artists.</p>

               RACISM AND SEXISM
               Racist and sexist attitudes characterize
               the same mentality. They sometimes
               appear in the same passage and are
               unconsciously paired, as when Read
               equates tattoos and cosmetics. The tat
               too refers to strange, threatening cus-
               toms of far-off places and mysterious
               people. Cosmetics, a form of self-orna-
               mentation, is equated with self-objecti-
               fication and inferiority (Schapiro). Ra-
               cism and sexism ward off the potential
               power and vitality of the other.
               Whereas nudity earlier alluded to wom-
               an as the object of male desire, here
               Malevich associates the nude female
               with savagery.</p>

               Herbert Read, Art and Industry,
               1953:
               “All ornament should be treated as
               suspect. I feel that a really civilized
               person would as soon tattoo his body
               as cover the form of a good work of
               art with meaningless ornament. Le-
               gitimate ornament I conceive as
               something like mascara and lipstick
               —something applied with discretion
               to make more precise the outlines of
               an atready existing beauty.
               Adolf Loos, “Ornament and Crime,
               1908:
               “The child is amoral. To our eyes,
               the Papuan is too. The Papuan kills
               his enemies and eats them. He is not
               a criminal. But when modern man
               kills someone and eats him he is
               either a criminal or a degenerate.
               The Papuan tattoos his skin, his
               boat, his paddles, in short every-
               thing he can lay hands on. He is not
               a criminal. The modern man who
               tattoos himself is either a criminal
               or a degenerate. There are prisons
               in which eighty percent of the in-
               mates show tattoos. The tattooed
               who are not in prison are latent
               criminals or degenerate aristocrats.
               If someone who is tattooed dies at
               liberty, it means he has died a few
               years before committing a murder.
               Meyer Schapiro, “The Social Bases
               of Art, 1936:

               constantly re-arranging herself as an
               aesthetic object.

               HIERARCHY OF HIGH-
               LOW ART
               Since the art experts consider the “high
               arts of Western men superior to all
               other forms of art, those arts done by
               non-Western people, low-class people
               and women are categorized as minor
               arts, primitive arts,” “low arts, etc.
               A newer more subtle way for artists to
               elevate themselves to an elite position is
               to identify their work with pure sci-
               ence, pure mathematics, linguistics
               and philosophy. The myth that high art
               is for a select few perpetuates the hier-
               archy in the arts, and among people as
               well.

               Clement Greenberg, “Avant-Garde
               and Kitsch, 1939:
               It will be objected that such art for
               the masses as folk art was developed
               under rudimentary conditions of
               production—and that a good deal of
               folk art is on a high level. Yes, it is—
               but folk art is not Athene, and it's
               Athene whom we want: formal cul-
               ture with its infinity of aspects, its
               luxuriance, its large comprehen-

               doubt, but of a lesser order than art
               pure and simple.

               "If we go on allowing the minor arts

               DECORATION AND
               DOMESTICITY
               The antithesis of the violence and des-
               truction idolized by Modern Art is the
               visual enhancement of the domestic en-
               vironment. (If humanism is equated
               with dynamism, the decorative is seen
               to be synonymous with the static). One
               method “modernism has used to dis-
               credit its opponents has been to associ-
               ate their work with carpets and wall-
               paper. Lacking engagement with
               human form or the real world,” the
               work of art must be stigmatized as dec-
               orative (Sedlmayr and Barnes/de Maz-
               ia). So decorative art is a code term sig-
               nifying failed humanism. Artists such
               as Gleizes and Kandinsky, anxious to
               escape the tag of the decorative, con-
               nect their work to older, humanist
               aspirations.

               aesthetic content, and this degrada-
               tion of form leaves cubistic painting
               with no claim to any status higher
               than decoration.</p>

               ornamental value of an arabesque or
               an Oriental carpet, and obtain an in-
               finite variety which would otherwise
               be impossible.

               AUTOCRACY
               Certain modern artists express the de-
               sire for unlimited personal power. The
               aesthetics of modernism —its ego-
               mania, violence, purity-fixation and
               denial of all other routes to the truth—is
               highly authoritarian. The reductivist
               ideology suggests an inevitable,
               evolutionary survival of the (aesthetic)
               fittest. Reinhardt declares throughout
               his writings that all the world’s art must
               culminate in his pure paintings. Oz-
               enfant equates purism with a super-
               state. Mendelsohn believes the advo-
               cates of the new art have a right to
               exercise control.

               Painting, 1966:
               “There is just one art history, one
               art evolution, one art progress.
               There is just one aesthetics, just one
               art idea, one art meaning, just one
               principle, one force. There is just
               one truth in art, one form, one
               change, one secrecy.
               Amédée Ozenfant, Foundations of
               Modern Art, 1931:
               “Purism is not an aesthetic, but a
               sort of super-aesthetic in the same
               way that the League of Nations is a
               superstate.

               By taking these quotes out of context
               we are not trying to hold these artists
               and writers up to ridicule. However, to
               continue reading them in an unques-
               tioning spirit perpetuates their biases.
               The language of their statements is of-
               ten dated—indeed, some of them are
               over a century old—but the sentiments
               they express still guide contemporary
               theory in art.
               Modernism, the theory of Modern
               Art, claimed to break with Renaissance
               humanism. Yet both doctrines glorify
               the individual genius as the bearer of
               creativity. It seems worth noting thai
               such heroic genius has always appeared
               in the form of a white Western male
               We, as artists, cannot solve these prob-
               lems, but by speaking plainly we hope
               to reveal the inconsistencies in assump-

               The feminine presence in the field of the decorative arts, more
               specifically, those related to textiles—weaving, embroidery, stitch-
               ery—is a time-honored one.' Indeed, women have continued to
               make significant contributions in this area through the nineteenth
               and twentieth centuries. For example, exhibits—rather conven-
               tional ones, to be sure—of lace, embroidery, tapestry and needle-
               work were prominent among the works illustrated in the official
               publication of Art and Handicraft in the Woman’s Building of the
               World’s Columbian Exposition in Chicago in 1893. Later, the
               leading weavers and tapestry makers at the Bauhaus—Anni Albers,
               Ruth Consemüller, Gunta Stölzl, Otti Berger, Benita Koch-Otte-
               were women.? Nevertheless, this traditional relation, or perhaps
               relegation, of women to the decorative arts was complicated by a
               variety of social and economic as well as ideological factors at the
               turn of this century. One complicating factor was the ambiguous
               status and prestige accorded to the decorative arts themselves,
               especially in relation to the so-called high arts of painting and sculp-
               ture. Another was the complex relationship of the decorative arts to
               the evolution of abstract painting and the subsequent development
               of an abstruse mystique to differentiate the latter from the former.
               Still another factor was the social, political and moral implications
               associated with the promotion of the handicrafts and with education
               in design, especially in Great Britain during the latter part of the
               nineteenth century
               Have women simply been shunted off into the so-called minor or
               decorative arts because these were considered less demanding and
               were certainly less prestigious? It is undeniable that English womer
               were admitted to the Schools of Design, both the Branch Schools
               and their own Female School in London, long before they were ad-
               mitted, in any significant numbers, to the teaching facilities of the
               Royal Academy. The ranks of these schools were swelled not merely
               by the working-class girls for whom this sort of training, aimed
               primarily at industrial design, was originally intended, but by vast
               crowds of impoverished young ladies who were in desperate straits
               trying to find employment in the arts, primarily as governesses."
               Even earlier, in France, Mme. Frere de Montyon, a student of Res-
               tout’s, had founded the Ecole Gratuite de Dessin pour les Jeunes
               Personnes, a school established in 1805 to help penniless voung
               women become self-supporting, an enterprise perhaps intended as
               much to aid public morals as to encourage artistic ability. The Ecole
               Gratuite de Dessin was brought under government jurisdiction in
               1810."
               The democratizing effort to extend knowledge of the applied arts
               to the lower classes—and to women—was carried further in subse
               quent attempts to break down completely the barriers between high
               art and the decorative arts. The attempt reached a climax in Great
               Britain during the late nineteenth century with the program of social
               transformation proposed by John Ruskin and, especially, by
               William Morris. Interestingly enough, women seem to have served
               little more than a purely inspirational function for Morris and his
               followers, although both Janey and May Morris produced em-
               broidery for the cause of arts and crafts. Women in late nineteenth-
               century England certainly made contributions to porcelain painting
               textiles, embroidery, and, often anonymously, to patchwork and
               other forms of stitchery, and of course Kate Greenaway was active
               as an illustrator and tile-designer, influencing Gauguin and many
               other painters. Nevertheless, women as a group were not prominent
               in the English Arts and Crafts Movement. In Scotland, however
               two unusually gifted and productive sisters, Frances Macdonald
               (1874-1921) and Margaret Macdonald (1865-1933) made majoi
               contributions in design. Margaret later married the innovative
               architect and designer Charles Rennie Mackintosh, and as mem-
               bers of his circle both sisters created imaginative curvilinear designs
               for architectural ornaments, metalwork, embroideries and stained
               glass, as well as watercolors that often hover on the brink of
               abstraction.</p>
            <p>
               Although the effort to overthrow the hegemony of “high art” by
               merging it with the “minor” arts, an effort that has characterized
               one current of vanguard ideology from Synthetism to Constructiv-
               ism, is by no means a feminine invention, the extent to which the
               decorative arts, especially those involving textiles, have played a role
               in the careers of advanced women artists is striking. Yet even
               though their achievements in these realms are often brilliant, the
               fact that painters like Nataliia Goncharova, Alexandra Exter.
               Liubov Popova and Varvara Stepanova, Sophie Taeuber-Arp and
               Vanessa Bell, Marguerite Zorach and Sonia Delaunay were in-
               volved in textile design, weaving, tapestry making and costume
               design nevertheless has equivocal implications. On the one hand, for
               a woman artist to “return, as it were, to her traditional role in the
               minor arts, generally less conducive to fame and fortune than a ca-
               reer in painting or sculpture, can be viewed as a retrograde step. Yet
               from another vantage point, we can say that advanced women art-
               ists involved in the decorative arts in the early twentieth century
               were contributing to the most revolutionary directions—both social
               and aesthetic—of their times.
               Marguerite Zorach may indeed have turned from painting to em-
               broidering tapestries after the birth of her second child, when she
               "no longer had the hours of uninterrupted concentration that she re
               quired to work out her personal views on canvas,”5 and Sonia De-
               launay may have moved from monumental Orphist canvases to fab-
               ric and dress design in order to support her husband and herself
               after the loss of her private income following the Russian Revolu-
               tion. Nevertheless it is also true that Zorach’s needlework, in many
               ways more original and interesting than her paintings, received
               more exposure and critical attention than her canvases during the
               1920s and ’30s,° and that Delaunay had had considerable success in
               the applied arts before the loss of her income’ and continued to
               make some of her most original contributions in this area through-
               out her career. Certainly the experiences of Sophie Taeuber-Arp
               and Vanessa Bell in the decorative arts exerted a progressive influ
               ence on their “high art” creations. Taeuber-Arp, who began as a
               textile specialist and taught weaving and embroidery at the Arts and
               Crafts School in Zurich, may well have influenced her husband
               Jean Arp, in the direction of greater abstraction as a result of the
               embroidery and weaving they did together at the time of the First
               World War. Indeed, it was probably precisely because of her back-
               ground in the decorative arts that Taeuber-Arp was one of the first
               artists to think of abstraction as a natural point of departure rather
               than the end of a long process of evolution from representation.
               Vanessa Bell’s participation from 1913 to 1919 in Roger Fry’s
               Omega Workshops, for which she designed screens, textiles and mo-
               saics, seems to have intensified her penchant for abstract colorism
               and bold surface treatment which had already been stimulated by
               contact with the Fauves and Cubists.
               In attempting to evaluate women artists’ contributions to the
               decorative arts, much depends on one’s attitude toward the relative
               importance of the “high versus the “applied” arts. If we consider
               painting the ultimate form of aesthetic expression, then it will be a
               foregone conclusion that Sonia Delaunay made a sacrifice by ne-
               glecting her monumental abstract canvases to produce fabrics and
               fashions, while her husband, Robert Delaunay, was permitted to
               continue his calling as a painter and, perhaps even more important,
               as a theorist of abstract art. If, however, we take a less conventiona
               view of what constitutes value in the avant-garde production of the
               twentieth century, we can see that women artists, by remaining
               faithful to their time-honored role as decorative artists, have ad-
               vanced the cause of abstraction and, at the same time, spread its
               message beyond the walls of the studio, museum and gallery into the
               realm of daily life—a goal devoutly sought by artists—whether
               high” or “applied, male or female—from the time of Ruskin and
               Morris to the Russian Revolution, the Bauhaus and afterwards.

               concerned.

               The Woman

               ven more important than the discovery of Columbus,
               which we are gathered to celebrate, is the fact that the Government
               has just discovered women.” These words were voiced not by a
               present-day feminist but by Bertha Honoré Palmer, a wealthy
               Chicago socialite, at the dedication ceremonies of the World’s Co
               lumbian Exposition in October 1892. While the Fair did indeed
               mark the 400th anniversary of Columbus’s discovery of the New
               World, more importantly it became the site of an international
               forum of women artists, writers, educators, scientists and craftsper
               sons. Government recognition, although not enthusiastic, aided the
               construction of the Woman’s Building and the establishment of the
               Woman’s Branch of the Auxiliary Congress which served as a public
               podium for the discussion of women’s status and rights.
               In fact, the very existence of the Woman’s Building can be credit-
               ed largely to feminists active in the late 1800s. For instance, in
               January 1890, when the United States Congress was considering
               establishing the Fair, Susan B. Anthony and other prominent fem-
               inists urged the Senate to guarantee women an active role in its plan-
               ning. As a token gesture a Board of Lady Managers was authorized,
               and although it had as many members as the men’s Columbian
               Commission, the latter actually ran the Fair. Nonetheless, the
               Woman’s Department of the Exposition, responsible for the Wo-
               man’s Building, its contents and overall management, was legally
               recognized and funded by the United States Government.
               Despite a certain second-class status, the women who par-
               ticipated in and managed portions of the Fair wielded considerable
               authority. One of the major reasons for this was the presence of Ber-
               tha Honore Palmer, President of the Board of Lady Managers, who
               was appointed to oversee the day-to-day operation of the Woman’s
               Building and the Auxiliary Congress. She was the wife of a powerful
               Chicago millionaire, Potter Palmer, the builder of Chicago s famous
               Palmer House, who, not coincidentally, was a promoter of the Fair
               and one of its largest financial sponsors. Bertha Palmer, however,
               was an extraordinary woman in her own right. Her participation in
               the Exposition and that of other wealthy and socially prominent
               women, including textile designer and educator Candace Thurber
               Wheeler, in the Exposition’s work, helped elevate the view of
               women’s art so that it was no longer viewed as an amateurish
               domestic hobby but as a serious endeavor.
               But there was another reason for American women’s finally being
               included in so auspicious a gathering as a World’s Fair. With the
               rapid rise of industrialization in America following the Civil War
               Washington found it politic to become officially involved with wom-
               en’s employment in industry if not full female suffrage
               While critics of feminism maintained that woman’s status was
               rooted in her economic dependence on man, one unalterable fact re
               mained: the rise of industrialization required a larger labor force to
               operate mass-production machinery than could be supplied by
               males. Women filled that gap. Thus, the number of women working
               for pay outside the home doubled from four to eight million between
               1890 and 1910; a previously untapped economic resource was now
               being utilized. In addition, industrialization and invention of the
               telephone, typewriter and telegraph created the need for the office
               girl.</p>
            <p>
               The Industrial Revolution also had profound social implications.
               In search of jobs young women (most of them single), like young
               men, flocked to large urban centers. Upon arriving in the city their
               social status immediately and perceptibly changed. Young, alone
               and economically independent, they were freed of their age-old
               dependence on home and family. Thrown together for the first time,
               these women forged close ties of friendship, and before long discov-
               ered by acting in consort they could be a powerful political force
               One of their very first actions was to agitate for the right to vote,
               which was then denied them.
               The Woman’s Department was, from the outset, plagued with
               difficulties. As work progressed on the Fair, the government backed
               away from its original commitment to the Woman’s Building and
               individual states had to assume the responsibility for funding its
               various exhibits. As a result, the Woman’s Building, one of the
               smallest at the Exposition, was granted only 8200,000 for its
               construction out of an estimated total of $12,700,000 budgeted for
               grounds and buildings. In addition, most of the women artists rep-
               resented in the Woman’s Building not only contributed their time
               and work free, but also had to absorb shipping and installation costs
               for displays of their work; men whose works were commissioned
               were usually paid in advance.
               Other forms of blatant discrimination continually hampered the
               efforts of the Board of Lady Managers and eventually determined
               the use to which the Woman’s Building was put. The building was
               not originally intended to be used for exhibit space; it was planned
               as the headquarters for women connected with the Fair. But, as
               Bertha Palmer noted: the building “. . . has been forced into that
               relation with the rest of the Exposition because of the partial exclu-
               sion of women elsewhere.”2
               Bertha Palmer summarized the difficulties the women had en-
               countered in an address she delivered at the opening of the
               Woman’s Building: “We have been obliged to march with peace of-
               ferings lest hostile motives be ascribed to us.”3 She went on to ad-
               vocate the liberation of women and made it clear that the Woman’s
               Building and its contents represented opportunities to advance the
               cause of women’s rights, especially those of working women. She
               said, perhaps with tongue in cheek:
               Without touching upon politics, suffrage, or other irrelevant is-
               sues, this unique organization of women for women will devote itselj
               to the formation of a public sentiment which will favor woman’s in
               dustrial equality, secure for her work the consideration and respect
               which it deserves, and establish her importance as an economic fac-
               tor. To this end it will endeavor to obtain and install in these
               buildings exhibits showing the value of her contributions to the in-
               dustries, sciences and arts, as well as statistics giving the proportion-
               ate amount of her work in every country.
               In order to fulfill this commitment, the organizers included as
               part of the exhibition records of women’s professional and economic
               status, reports from social, industrial and cooperative associations
               and a compilation of statistics on women’s legal, social, political and
               economic status in countries throughout the world. It was the aim of
               the Board to see that this information was “. . . placed on record as</p>

               public documents among the archives of every country.”5 The
               Woman’s Department further supplied information to women on
               employment possibilities and training. It was the first time that such
               a comprehensive survey of women s activities and conditions in
               every part of the world had been made. The overall impact of this
               contribution still has not been fully evaluated.
               Another far-reaching and innovative idea was the Children’s
               Building. It was conveniently located next to the Woman’s Building
               and provided a place for women to leave their children safely in the
               hands of a trained staff for a small fee while they viewed the exhibits
               at the Fair. The Children’s Building contained a large gymnasium,
               a library, a workshop, a nursery and several other departments. The
               workshop contained every kind of machine and mechanical device,
               giving both boys and girls an opportunity to learn how to use tools
               and develop their mechanical abilities. As such, it is probably the
               earliest example of a day-care center. Like other projects organizec
               by women at the Fair, the Children’s Building was given no money
               by the Exposition authorities and was completely financed by the
               Board of Lady Managers.
               The architect for the Woman’s Building was Sophia G. Hayden.
               In 1890, she became the first woman to complete the four-year
               course in architecture (with honors) from the Massachusetts In-
               stitute of Technology. Hayden’s design was selected from twelve
               others and she began supervision of the building’s construction in
               July 1891. She designed her building in the neoclassic style which
               was enjoying a revival at the time and was required by the Exposi-
               tion committee.
               The elaborately ornamental Hall of Honor formed the spine of the
               structure and rose to the building’s full two-story height. Sixty-seven
               and a half feet wide and 200 feet long, it was topped by a skylight.
               The Hall of Honor was reserved for the core of the fine arts exhibits
               in the Woman’s Building. The major decoration of this important
               room was left to six American artists: Mary Cassatt, Mary Mac
               Monnies, Lucia-Fairchild Fuller, Amanda Brewster Sewall, Rosina
               Emmett Sherwood and Lydia Emmett.
               Sherwood and Emmett were sisters who had both studied with
               William Merritt Chase at the Art Students’ League in New York
               and later in Paris at the Julian Academy. Sherwood’s mural was ti-
               tled, “The Republic’s Welcome to Her Daughters.” Her sister’s
               mural, “Music, Art and Literature, showed the three disciples
               personified by three female figures. Fairchild-Fuller, a Bostonian,
               had also studied with Chase at the League and was a successful min-
               iature painter. Her mural, “The Women of Plymouth, depicted
               Pilgrim women and children engaged in domestic chores. Sewall
               was born in upstate New York, studied at Cooper Union and with
               Chase and William Sartain at the League in Paris. For her mural,
               Women in Arcadia, she was awarded a bronze medal by the Co-
               lumbian Commission.
               The two most famous women artists participating in the
               building’s decoration were MacMonnies and Cassatt. MacMon-
               nies’s 60-foot mural, “Primitive Woman,” located on the north tym-
               panum of the Hall of Honor, was one of the largest ever painted by a
               woman. It was divided into three sections that illustrated the roles of
               ancient women as wives, mothers and workers. Cassatt’s commis</p>
            <p>
               sion to decorate the south tympanum on the subject of modern
               woman was her first commission in America and her first attempt at
               mural decoration. Cassatt’s space was identical to MacMonnies’s,
               but Cassatt divided her mural into three separate panels with three
               allegorical themes. The central and largest panel was “Young
               Women Plucking the Fruits of Knowledge and Science.” In the
               right-hand panel were three women who personified the “Arts,
               Music and Dancing, and in the left-hand panel were “Young Girls
               Pursuing Fame.
               Also decorating the Hall of Honor were murals and paintings,
               etchings and engravings contributed by American, German, Austri-
               an, English, French and Spanish women. In addition, sculpture
               and numerous handicrafts were displayed. There was even a bas-
               relief entitled “Ophelia made by the famous French actress, Sarah
               Bernhardt. Finally, names of important women from around the
               world in the arts, sciences, literature and other disciplines were
               recorded.
               Running along the easterly side of the Hall of Honor were rooms
               largely devoted to the technological side of women’s contributions.
               Among these rooms were two Scientific rooms, an Inventions room
               and an Educational room.
               Passing through the corridors, the visitor could then enter the
               Northern Pavilion (on the north side of the building) or the South-
               ern Pavilion (on the south side). In the Northern Pavilion were ex-
               hibits from countries such as Russia, Australia and England. The
               Russian section was especially notable. A remarkable reproduction
               of a Byzantine gate of the twelfth century marked the entrance. It
               was made of oak and joined together without a single nail. The
               wood surface was overlaid with gold leaf. The work was designed
               and constructed solely by Russian women. Exhibits of cottage
               industries from Scotland and Ireland included hand-knitted stock-
               ings and gloves, shawls and ecclesiastical vestments, as well as many
               fine examples of embroidery and needlework. Examples of uniquely
               Irish lacemaking techniques could be seen in displays of Irish point
               lace, Limerick lace and Carrickmacross lace. The Northern
               Pavilion also included exhibits of stained glass designs, wallpaper
               and silk designs, book-cover designs and book illustrations, con-
               tributed by American and foreign women.
               The most notable exhibit in the Northern Pavilion was that of
               American Applied Arts. The handicraft contributions (specifically,
               needlework and embroidery) of the Associated Artists Society, one
               of the first American schools of embroidery and design, as well as
               the woven textiles and tapestries, were among the best examples of
               handwork in the Woman s Building. This exhibit had been organ-
               ized by Candace Thurber Wheeler, who lent her considerable ar-
               tistic and managerial talents to the Woman’s Building and oversaw
               its interior decoration. It is fair to say that the American renaissance
               in embroidery and needlework was initiated and largely affected by
               Wheeler. Thanks to her perseverance and clout, needlework ex-
               hibits at the Columbian Exposition were no longer predominantly
               English or European, as they had been in the Centennial Exposition
               seventeen years earlier.

               the Southern Pavilion which was devoted to exhibits of lacemaking,
               embroidery, fan painting, jewelry, silverware, carved wood, leather
               and fans. These exhibits came from France, Italy, Mexico, Japan
               Spain, Belgium, Austria, Germany, Sweden and Norway, as well as
               far-off places such as Siberia, Siam, Ceylon, Brazil and the Cape of
               Good Hope. One of the most popular exhibits was that organized by
               the Japanese Woman’s Commission. Two rooms of a typical
               Japanese dwelling were carefully reproduced. The inclusion of such
               details as fine inlaid boxes, polished steel mirrors and a woman’s
               boudoir gave the spectator a true sense of having actually visited a
               Japanese home. Another exhibit of special interest was the collec
               tion of lace sent by Queen Margherita of Italy which traced the
               history of lacemaking in that country as well as in all other lace-
               making countries.
               The elevator, a welcome feature of the building at this point of the
               tour, would then whisk the visitor to the gallery floor of the
               building, which contained exhibits primarily from the United
               States.
               Running along the east wall of the gallery floor were the Californ-
               ia, Cincinnati, Kentucky and Japanese rooms (the Japanese exhib-
               ited here as well as in the Southern Pavilion). The California room
               was warmly inviting with its ceilings, doors and wainscoting all
               made of rich, mellow redwood. The room was decorated with
               stained glass designed and executed by American women.
               The Cincinnati room, the largest and most important room of this
               section of the gallery, served as the Managers’ Drawing Room. Its
               display of pottery executed by Cincinnati women underscored
               women’s unique contributions to the craft. Of special interest was
               Rookwood Pottery, an adaptation of the art nouveau style with flat,
               linear floral patterns and varied glazes—all of which had gainec
               Rookwood an international reputation for fine ceramics craftsman-
               ship. In addition to examples of Rookwood Pottery decorated by
               the Rookwood Pottery founder, Mrs. Maria Longworth Nichols</p>

               Storer, there were pieces created by members of the Cincinnati Pot-
               tery Club. M. Louise McLaughlin, founder of the Pottery Club in
               1879, had developed an unusual method of underglaze painting and
               “Losanti Ware, a hard porcelain with a feldspathic glaze fired at a
               low temperature. Examples of her work were included in the Cin-
               cinnati room exhibit
               Perhaps the most important room, next to the Hall of Honor, was
               the Library, located directly opposite the Cincinnati room on the
               west side of the gallery. The interior decoration, including the dark,
               carved oak bookcases, was the work of Candace Thurber Wheeler,
               Dora Wheeler Keith, her daughter, decorated the Library’s ceiling.
               She chose an allegorical theme appropriate to the room: a male
               figure represented Science; Literature was personified by a woman
               standing beside Science, and Imagination, also a female figure,
               stood between the two, symbolizing the reconciliation and binding
               of one to the other. More importantly, the Library contained over
               7,000 volumes of American and foreign women’s writings (including
               such great authors as Jane Austen, the Bronte sisters, George Eliot,
               the poetess Harriet Monroe, Louisa Alcott and Susan B. Anthony
               making it the largest such collection at that time. Two Records
               rooms flanked the Library and contained statistics of woman’s work
               in several countries.
               Also located on this side of the gallery was the English Training
               School for Nurses. It was a model of a room for the instruction of
               nurses and contained all sorts of medical and surgical instruments
               along with portraits of women who were famous for their contri-
               butions to nursing and medicine, such as Florence B. Nightingale.
               After visiting the English Training School for Nurses, the fair-
               goer could walk through the north corridor to the Assembly Room
               which was used for meetings, lectures and concerts, and then on to
               the large Model Kitchen. The kitchen was equipped with the most
               modern appliances then available and staffed with teachers who in-
               structed women in the science of preparing nutritional foods and
               even in preparing Indian corn.
               The visitor might pleasantly end the tour by resting and dining in
               the garden cafe of the Woman’s Building—a quiet oasis in green in
               which, reputedly, the best food at the Fair was to be found.
               The significance of the exhibits of the Woman’s Building was
               multifaceted. By making the achievements of many fine women art-
               ists and craftswomen more widely known, they corrected miscon-
               ceptions about women’s artistic abilities and made it clear that
               women held an important place in the history of the arts. In addi-
               tion, the Woman’s Building provided a forum for presenting the
               theme of the changing roles of women. Facts were available for
               public and personal consumption, and as they cut across social and
               class barriers, must have had a considerable impact on both sexes.
               For women, especially, the new sense of history, pride and ac
               complishment alone was worth the long and arduous struggle to
               make their building and its contents public.</p>

               It was a time when women were flowers, and painted flowers, that is, flowers painted themselves, and they smelled
               good and talked a special language. Flowers and women were equal under sexist law. Women and flowers and paint-
               ings of flowers—so interchangeable and interrelated. But no one has yet spoken of flower liberation.

               “One of the most delightful accomplishments that
               can be chosen for the fair sex is that of catching
               the transient shades of beauty which are found
               upon flowers, and fixing them on paper. The able
               pencil shows to us the queen of spring with her
               spherical form, her delicate colours, the beautiful
               green of her foliage, the thorns which protect her
               the dew-drops which bathe her, and the butterfly
               which skims lightly over her beautiful form.

               are not present together in all flowers. When both are present, the
               flower is said to be perfect or bisexual. All complete flowers are
               obviously also perfect. When only one kind of essential organ is
               present, the flower is termed imperfect, or unisexual. . . . When
               the same plant bears unisexual flowers of both sexes, it is said to
               be monoecious: when the male and female flowers are on differ-

               Trapped Women: Two Sister Designers</p>
            <p>
               The large, white, airy and austere room
               with its severely elegant chairs and tables
               and attenuated, weeping ladies transfixed in
               pale olive or light mauve-colored gesso
               panels around its walls, is now full. Te-
               cups chink against saucers, silk-clad wrist.
               are held at a delicate angle, feather-plumed
               hats bob up and down, white lawn and lace
               covered bosoms heave sighs of contentment
               cheeks flush, tongues loosen, and the buzz
               of women s talk rises a quaver or two above
               the level thought acceptable if this room, a
               tearoom, had been found in London. But
               the like of this room, and others designed by
               Charles Rennie Mackintosh, architect, and
               his wife, Margaret Macdonald, a decorative
               designer, was not to be found in London noi
               in any other smart city in turn-of-the
               century Britain, but in Glasgow, dirty, ro-
               bust, tough and far-from-genteel Glasgow
               the industrial capital of Scotland
               In the late 1890s in the heart of this city's
               sober business district a few strikingly dif
               ferent and simple tearoom facades ap-
               peared. Their exteriors, interiors, furniture
               and fittings displayed unconventional solu-
               tions, ethereal elegance and flights of im-
               aginative thinking not seen before in the arts
               of this city. Glasgow was in the throes of an
               artistic renewal.</p>
            <p>
               Margaret Macdonald (1865-1933), who
               contributed designs to the tearooms, and
               her sister Frances Macdonald (1874-1921
               were two of a number of women artists who.
               for a short while, helped make the arts alive
               in Glasgow. What follows is a brief account
               of their lives, set against the background of
               Glasgow, and a discussion of a few of the
               objects the sisters designed and made.
               The liveliness of the arts in this industrial
               capital (Europe’s sixth largest city) grew in
               part from its sound economic base. In the
               previous half-century the heavy industries of
               the area, mining and shipbuilding for ex-
               ample, enjoyed boom growth.' And some of
               the profits, often via the increased income
               and leisure time of Glasgow’s upper anc
               middle classes, found their way into the sup-
               port and patronage of local arts. How pleas-
               ant to sit in a new tearoom designed by Scot-
               tish artists of national prominence, with
               works by local and internationally known
               painters hung about on the walls, to sit there
               and eat a quick lunch or to linger leisurel,
               over afternoon tea. How very natural to
               stroll from the tearoom, seek out the
               painters or the craftsmen or women in near
               by studios, chat with them about their work
               and sometimes, proudly, bear home a paint
               ing, a watercolor, or even a beaten metal</p>

               In those days it was safe to bet your last
               brass farthing that any artist whose work
               turned your head had been a student at the
               Glasgow School of Art. Founded in 1840
               the school grew out of the firm convictior
               that well-trained artists and designers could
               promote both the nation’s esteem and trade.
               Its founders had both insight and acumen.
               Under the bustling leadership of the school's
               young headmaster, Francis Newbery, and
               his wife, Jessie, students in the 1880s and
               1890s received excellent training and
               energetic promotion.2 Newbery’s students
               were also fortunate in that their emerging
               maturity and talents coincided with their
               city’s peak industrial, intellectual and ar
               tistic growth.
               Francis and Jessie Newbery fostered the
               talents of four students in particular: the
               Macdonald sisters and two young men
               Charles Rennie Mackintosh and Herbert
               MacNair, interior and furniture designers.
               The sisters were day students and the men
               were evening students; Newbery, in a cri-
               tique of their works, told the four about the
               similarity of their styles, and suggested they
               meet.” In about 1895 the sisters and their

               Margaret and Frances Macbonlald</p>
            <p>
               Before they met Charles and Herbert, the
               sisters had already established themselves as
               designers and craftswomen, showing great
               versatility in the range of objects they made
               and the materials with which they worked:
               embroidered hangings and covers, gesso
               panels, leaded glass panels, clocks, posters,
               water colors, book illustrations, and their
               specialty, repoussé metal panels. Margaret
               and Frances Macdonald worked well as a
               team. Not only did they cooperate on ideas
               and drawing, but they often bent over the
               same metal panel to work side by side. They
               enjoyed life. They shared a studio and held
               salons for all the leading writers and artists
               of Glasgow. The sisters were more than able
               to hold their own. During the short years of
               “The Four’s” life, from about 1895 to 1899,
               the two women continued to work very
               closely together. “The Four” exhibited to
               gether and exchanged ideas and designs
               The men, for example, designed furniture in
               which the sisters’ decorative gesso panels
               were inset. The sisters evidently found the
               collective working arrangement to their ad-
               vantage: during these years they produced
               their most original and vigorous designs.
               In 1899 Frances married MacNair and
               the two moved to Liverpool where he had a
               teaching post. The next year Margaret mar</p>
            <p>
               ried Mackintosh. The MacNairs’ move to
               Liverpool brought the sisters’ working ar
               rangement and the collaboration of “The
               Four” to an end. After 1899, the four artists
               produced independently or collaborated
               with their marriage partner on design pro
               jects. Although groups of artists were quite
               common in those decades (members of the
               various small English arts and crafts organ-
               izations around William Morris, Arthur
               Mackmurdo and Walter Crane worked anc
               exhibited together), no two artists during
               this period seemed to work and live in such
               close harmony as the two sisters. Their life
               and work together in the Glasgow studic
               gave a certain intensity to their work, an in-
               tensity which was lost after they separated
               in 1899.
               The strand of another independent,
               spirited and middle-class woman, Catherine
               Cranston, is yet to be woven into the story
               Catherine became a principal patron of
               Charles and Margaret Macdonald.“ As the
               creator and owner of the tearooms she com
               missioned husband and wife to design the
               rooms’ every aspect, from their structure
               and decoration to designs for posters and
               menu cards. In the tearooms the arts and
               crafts mingled freely and complemented
               each other.</p>

               Better yet, Catherine Cranston’s women
               customers found the environment suppor-
               tive. The tearooms created a social phenom-
               enon by becoming “virtually the first places
               of their kind where even the richest and
               most elegant of Edwardian female society
               might properly meet without chaperons.”5
               Unlike the tearoom clientele, Margaret
               and Frances lived free from the shadows of
               chaperons. By the standards of their day
               they were liberated. Details of their lives
               before marriage are poorly documented, so
               it is difficult to locate the source of their in-
               dependence. Since independence and crea-
               tivity are so strongly linked, however, and of
               great interest in the biographies of women
               artists, I shall undertake a reconstruction of
               their early lives
               In the late 1880s Margaret and Frances
               Macdonald returned from England with
               their father. It is probable that the sisters
               raised in England, at first felt foreign in
               Glasgow. Events that uproot or bring great
               changes to lives are often those encouraging
               a sense of self and a desire to do something
               with one’s life. Possibly the move to Glas
               gow acted as a stimulus to the sisters. At any
               rate, Margaret and Frances knew who they
               were, knew what they wanted to do and,
               soon after their arrival in Glasgow, first</p>

               Margaret, then Frances entered the School
               of Art.
               Once in the school, the sisters found sup-
               port for their ideas in the presence of other
               like-minded women, such as Jessie Newbery
               and their contemporaries, Jessie King,
               craftswoman and book illustrator, and Jane
               Fonie, an interior designer. A tradition of
               active women had been established at the
               school in 1882 when a group of former
               students founded the Glasgow Society of
               Lady Artists’ Club, the oldest women’s club
               in Britain.“
               The sisters acquired backbone at the
               school. They were trained in drawing from
               the model, drawing freehand, anatomical
               and botanical drawing, as well as ornamen-
               tal design. The school encouraged them to
               develop their own distinctive styles at an
               early stage. Soon their unrefined and un-
               tamed energies led to bizarre shapes, to
               angular and cutting edges to their female
               forms.
               Shortly after leaving the school the sisters
               reputations traveled as far as London. In
               1896, the London Arts and Crafts Exhibi-
               tion Society invited “The Four” to send fur-
               niture, craftwork and posters in the mod-
               ern style” to that year’s exhibition. The sis-
               ters sent four pieces, two of which they had
               worked on together: a clock of beaten silver
               with beaten brass weights and an aluminum
               pendulum, a muffin stand, a beaten alumi-
               num panel, The Star of Bethlehem, by
               Francis and The Annunciation by
               Margaret.
               The themes of these early figurative piec-
               es express the sisters two constant icon-
               ographic interests, women and babies. Fre-
               quently the woman/ Virgin appears trapped
               and isolated within their work. And, though
               Christian subject matter did not recur as
               often in the later pieces, apparently the in-
               tensity of their religious convictions never
               dimmed. What a pagan and savage inter-
               pretation they gave to their Virgin and Child
               images. London eyes boggled.
               In the mid-1890s the English arts and
               crafts movement was dominated by William
               Morris’s most faithful disciple, Walter</p>
            <p>
               Crane. His designs pleased everyone, but
               then they were too innocuous to do other-
               wise. The polite London art crowd moving
               from a Crane to a Macdonald cried out,
               The Spook School!
               We can see why. Look at a mirror frame
               (Figure 5) made by Frances in 1896-1897.
               Two excruciatingly thin female figures with
               ghoulish eyes point accusingly at each other
               over the seed cases of the Honesty plant.
               The seed pods look like death’s heads. And
               how spooky is the round copper sconce
               made by both sisters in 1896-1897 (Figure
               1). Imagine it nailed to the wall of a dark-
               ened room and lit by the fluttering light of
               candles in its holders. Visualize how the eyes
               in the round copper plate, and in its sup-
               ports, might enlarge and shrink in the jump-
               ing shadows of candlelight. Now look at the
               two female figures, with scraggy, flattened
               forms and hanging breasts imprisoned with-
               in the rectangular panels of a pair of beaten
               brass candle sconces (Figures 2 and 3),
               designed by the two sisters in the same
               years. Strange details give the figures in
               these sconces an apocryphal air: attached to
               one figure is an orb, supporting a baby
               suckling at the breast; on the other a cres-
               cent moon superimposes its cruel edges and,
               in the outspread hands of the same figure,
               vivid marks, more like stigmata than wrin-
               kles, are slashed in the open palms. The air
               of suffering and martyrdom in these figures
               is so marked that I find myself speculating
               whether the sisters, consciously or uncon-
               sciously, made associations between these
               two female figures and the sacrificial roles
               lived out by the majority of women they
               knew. But not themselves; at this point they
               were still free.
               The sisters might have felt dashed by the
               epithet “The Spook School” since the Arts
               and Crafts Exhibition Society never asked
               them or “The Four” to exhibit again. How-
               ever, Gleeson White, editor of the influen-
               tial arts magazine The Studio, responded
               enthusiastically to the originality of their
               designs and visited Glasgow to find out
               more about the arts and crafts movement
               there. After his visit, The Studio published</p>
            <p>
               a two-part article on the Glasgow artists
               with part one almost entirely devoted to the
               Macdonald sisters’ works.
               Gleeson White was impressed that the
               sisters not only designed all the pieces he
               saw but, apart from some joinery work, they
               handled, beat and wrought even the large
               and heavy pieces themselves, including two
               floor-standing clocks. Neither sister was
               covetous of her individual contribution to
               the pieces they jointly designed and execut-
               ed. They refused to be drawn into games of
               identification.
               After looking at their early emaciated
               figures, the inflated look the sisters’ works
               acquire in the early 1900s comes as a sur-
               prise. Reproduced here is a panel Margaret
               designed in colored plaster for the Rose
               Boudoir (Figure 6), shown at the Interna-
               tional Exhibition, Turin, 1902. Some of
               Frances’s figures acquire a similar full-
               blown look in these years. In the early 1900s
               the sisters changed their models; the in-
               fluence of Japanese prints and works by the
               pre-Raphaelites superseded the earlier
               sources of Celtic art, Aubrey Beardsley and
               Jan Toorop.1° In the 1900s an inventive note
               appeared in Margaret’s use of junk mater-
               ials: colored glass, rope and plaster. The
               materials cost little and gave a rich, jeweled
               effect. But the rawness, the evil, the spirits
               that had made their early metal pieces fairly
               rattle, had gone. No amount of fancy cur-
               vilinear lines or innovative mixing of media
               could atone for this. Do success and mar-
               riage account for this transformation of the
               sisters works?
               No matter the causes, each new develop-
               ment the sisters and their husbands brought
               forth was eagerly seized upon by their au-
               dience on the Continent. In 1900 they were
               invited to furnish and decorate an entire
               room at the eighth Secessionist Exhibition in
               Vienna. In 1902, along with other Glasgow
               artists, they exhibited works in the Scottish
               section of the International Exhibition of
               Decorative Art in Turin. Everything the
               four artists sent to the two exhibitions sold.
               Between 1899 and 1905, articles, reviews
               and illustrations of their works appeared</p>

               frequently in influential journals such as
               Dekorative Kunst and Deutsche Kunst und
               Dekoration; Ver Sacrum, the official publi-
               cation of the Vienna Secession, devoted an
               issue to them.
               Suddenly, in 1905, curiosity about the
               four artists declined on the Continent. Even
               in Scotland the number of commissions
               began to drop; England never revived the
               brief interest it had displayed in 1896.
               Though Charles and Margaret had a highly
               successful exhibition in St. Petersburg in
               1913, where everything but the carpet sold,
               and though one other show was planned for
               Paris in 1914, the successes of their first
               heady decade were never repeated.
               It becomes impossible to find published
               reproductions of the sisters works after
               1905. One of the last I found is a gesso panel
               made by Margaret in 1905 (Figure 4). Un-
               deniably, this is the most powerfully model-
               ed piece yet seen, but the subject shows a
               dangerous stagnation. It is no more than a
               summation of themes explored earlier by the
               sisters. For whom were those plaster tears
               meant to fall? Catherine Cranston s
               tearoom clientele? Or Margaret and her
               sister? Did Margaret begin to feel she was
               cast in a mold much as her rope and glass
               ladies? Did she mourn her lost independ-
               ence? Were her spirits and her creativity
               slipping away? I believe so, and I am sad-
               dened.
               1 am against passive readings of history.
               People, their deeds, as well as those they
               avoided doing, affect us mightily. The Mac-
               donald sisters capitulated.1 They allowed
               their strident voices of the 1890s to fade into
               soothing murmurs and echoes of what once
               they were. How dared they! (They make it
               harder for us to shape ourselves into the
               creative and independent beings we would
               like to be. We need all the positive models
               we can get our hands on, and here are two
               more negative ones.)
               Did this change in their art reflect the
               constraints of their times? Yes. It was dif-
               ficult for women in turn-of-the-century
               Glasgow to train and practice as architects,
               as the Macdonalds’ husbands did. Both sis-</p>

               ters would have benefited from the training
               and practice of this profession. The status of
               crafts, despite the sincere activities of
               William Morris who tried to unite the arts
               and the crafts (and all the activities and or-
               ganizations that this engendered) remained
               very much a poor relative of their rich aunt.
               Fine Art. Margaret and Frances worked at
               their drawing boards and hammered out
               their metal panels. They probably wondered
               what the studio people were up to. Fine art-
               ists (among them women) painted decadent
               images of women—think of Beardsley’s art.
               Could Margaret and Frances humbly work-
               ing in the lower echelons of the crafts not
               pick up those cues? As craftswomen work-
               ing in a stratified society, it might not have
               occurred to them to push their early in-
               dependent spirits farther than they did.
               The Macdonald sisters’ best years were
               all too short. Their career spanned the per-
               iod of the realliance between the arts and
               the crafts and its subsequent deterioration.
               Neither Glasgow’s renaissance of the arts
               nor women’s independence survived two de-
               cades. The cycles of local movements were
               taken up within the larger motions grinding
               inside the machinery of Western capitalist
               society in the years preceding World War I.
               When the confidence, energy and profits of
               the middle and upper classes decreased in
               those years, the effect was soon seen in the
               arts. In the depression of the 1930s, one of
               the last of Glasgow s tearooms, 12 its wood,
               brick, colored glass, rope, pale mauve and

               hammers of demolition workers.</p>

                  ROBINEAU:
                  Ceramist from Syracuse
                  Peg Weiss</p>

               <p>
               Adelaide Alsop Robineau (1865-
               1929) who worked and lived most of her
               life in Syracuse, New York, was one of
               the foremost ceramists of her time and
               is today regarded by many as America s
               greatest ceramist. She was a perfec-
               tionist: in 25 years of continued cre-
               ativity she produced only 600 works
               which she deemed worthy of survival.
               Nearly every known piece is a superior
               example of its type, whether it be the
               grand feu (high-fire) porcelain at which
               she excelled or stoneware; crystalline
               glaze or flammé; excised or pierced egg
               shell.</p>
               <p>Born in Middletown, Connecticut,
               the daughter of an engineer and invent-
               or, Adelaide Alsop was artistically tal-
               ented and determined to be self-
               supporting. She first turned to the dec-
               oration of porcelain, teaching herself
               the technique from books. She was
               soon proficient enough to become a
               teacher of porcelain painting, a career
               she pursued for several years at St.
               Mary s Hall school in Minnesota. In
               the early 1890s she returned to New
               York where she studied painting briefly
               with William Merritt Chase, still sup--
               porting herself as a china decorator.</p>
               <p>At 34, she married Samuel Robineau
               whom she had met in the Midwest.
               They joined G. H. Clark in Syracuse to
               found and publish Keramic Studio with
               Adelaide Robineau as editor. The new
               porcelain painters’ magazine soon dom-
               mated the field. A typical issue might
               include descriptions of new materials
               and techniques, an art historical article
               on Chinese porcelain painting and
               Robineau’s own designs and writings.
               Keramic Studio complemented another
               nationally known magazine published
               in the Syracuse area, The Craftsman.
               Edited by Gustave Stickley, creator of
               Mission furniture, it promoted the
               ideals of the international arts and
               crafts movement inherited from Wil-
               liam Morris. The magazines were ex-
               tremely influential to the development
               and flourishing of the American arts
               and crafts movement, achieving na-
               tional circulation in a short time.</p>
               <p>In 1903, Samuel Robineau translat-
               ed and published in Keramic Studio a
               series of articles by Taxile Doat, the
               Sevres master, on the making of grand
               feu porcelain. Adelaide Robineau had
               longed to create new forms and inspired
               by these articles she went to study with
               Charles Binns at the pottery school in
               Alfred, New York. She then set up her
               own kiln at home and fired her first
               batch of porcelains, with her husband
               serving as her advisor and technician.
               She experimented alone, however, with
               different clay bodies and developed a
               remarkable range of glazes, fixed and
               flowing, crystalline and matte, for
               which she is famous. She also ex-
               perimented endlessly to adjust Doat s
               formulas to her own materials and
               discovered a special variety of Texas
               kaolin that lent itself to her re-
               quirements of translucency and
               strength.</p>
               <p>In 1903-1904, the Robineaus built a
               house and separate studio on a hillside
               overlooking Syracuse which Adelaide
               designed with an architect friend,
               Catharine Budd. The studio building
               consisted of three stories: the kiln area
               on the first floor, the pottery on the se-
               cond and a playroom for the three
               Robineau children on the third. Having
               the children nearby while mother pur-
               sued her profession was considered
               drastically modern when the Rob-
               ineau home was featured in American
               Homes and Gardens in 1910. The
               buildings still stand on Robineau Road
               in Syracuse.</p>            
            <p>
               Adelaide Robineau’s brilliant experi-
               ments included the oxblood flammé of
               Chinese tradition, crystalline glazes in
               blue, white and maize, crackles and in-
               laid slip designs. She undertook a chal-
               lenge most of her contemporaries
               thought was impossible: the creation of
               eggshell coupes or shallow rimles
               bowls with excised designs. Because the
               paper-thin porcelain clay is so brittle, i
               can only be worked in the dry state
               and carving it requires extraordinary
               patience and delicacy. Of her 12 at-
               tempts at eggshell pieces, only three
               survived. The third, with a beautiful,
               excised design of swans, was broken
               in Detroit on its way to an exhibition.</p>
               <p>In 1910 Robineau was invited by Ed-
               ward G. Lewis, founder of the
               American Women’s League, to teach at
               University City Pottery at St. Louis,
               Missouri, and to work there with Tax-
               ile Doat. According to Paul Evans,
               “for a short time the University City
               Pottery had the most notable group of
               ceramic artists and experts thus far
               associated with an institution in this
               country. While there the Robineaus
               founded another magazine, Palette and
               Bench, under Lewis s sponsorship.</p>
               It was also in St. Louis that Robin-
               eau created the magnificent “Scarab
               Vase which won a grand prize at the
               1910 Turin International Exposition. It
               required 1,000 hours of labor and two
               firings. Also called “The Apotheosis of
               the Toiler, the vase is decorated with
               an excised design of scarabs, a symbolic
               reference to the patience and skill
               demanded of the craftswoman. It is of
               translucent porcelain with an unglazed
               background and a relief design in a
               semi-opaque white glaze. Accents in
               pale blue-green are achieved with a
               thin, fixed, semi-opaque copper glaze.
               In the “Poppy Vase of 1910, Robin-
               eau expressed a personal style that the
               influential New York critic, Royal Cor
               tissoz, later called a blending of
               precious qualities—of knowledge, skill,
               judgement, taste, and above all, the
               sense of beauty.”7 This vase, 6¼ inches
               high, is decorated with an exquisite
               poppy and leaf design which was first
               excised and then inlaid with colored


            <pb facs="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BucknellDSC/heresies/main/issue04/images/Heresies_04_056.jpg" n="56" xml:id="img_0056"/>
            <p>
               slips. In the firing, the glazes remained
               perfectly set within the inlay, coloring
               and hardening to produce the effect of a
               transparent enamel over the whole.
               Small as it is, the vase has a monu-
               mental quality typical of Robineau s
               best work.</p>
               <p>Another masterpiece is the “Viking
               Ship Vase of 1905. With rich matte
               and semi-matte glazes of blue, green,
               brown and cream, the modest form is
               decorated with a typical Art Nouveau
               Viking ship motif, wave-tossed around
               its rim, a symbol of human trans-
               cendence over the vicissitudes of life. In
               a remarkable tour de force, the Viking
               ship motif is transformed from relief to
               sculpture in the delicately pierced, in-
               dependent stand which supports the
               vase.</p>
               <p>Vase after vase displays exquisite in-
               vention, from the subtle striations of
               the “Snake Bowl” with its delicate rep-
               tilian head, to the iridescent crystals of
               a small untitled white vase. Stylistical-
               ly, the work ranges from restrained and
               elegant adaptations of Art Nouveau or
               arts and crafts movement taste to the
               orientalizing manner of the eggshell
               coupes to Art Deco urns.</p>
              <p> Her work was so specialized and
               technically difficult that Robineau
               could not expect great moneta
               rewards. Whereas Louis Comfort Tif-
               fany in New York and Lalique in
               France employed many workers and
               turned out multiple versions of their
               patterns, Robineau’s creations were
               unique. Once in an attempt to increase
               her income, she tried to mass-produce
               porcelain doorknobs, but the endless
               repetition so frustrated and bored her
               that the operation ceased almost as
               soon as it began.</p>
               <p>Nevertheless, she was richly reward-
               ed by professional recognition during
               her lifetime. Her work was introduced
               to the public at the 1904 St. Louis Ex-
               position and in 1905 Tiffany and Co.
               became an agent for the Robineau por-
               celains. She was selected to exhibit at
               the Musee des Arts Décoratifs and at
               the Paris Salon in 1911, was awarded
               Grand Prize at the 1915 San Francisco
               Exposition, and received special prizes
               and awards from the Art Institute of
               Chicago and the societies of arts and
               crafts in Detroit and Boston. She re-
               ceived an honorary Doctor of Ceramic
               Science degree from Syracuse Universi
               ty in 1917 and in 1920 she joined the
               faculty. The Metropolitan Museum
               mounted an unusual one-person me-
               morial exhibition of her work.</p>
               <p>According to Samuel Robineau’s ac-
               counting, she earned only about
               810,000 from the sale of her work. To-
               day it is considered priceless, a fact she
               anticipated in an hitherto unpublished
               letter:</p>
               <quote>In the days of the ancient Chinese pot-

               fine example of the work of this or that
               artist it will be added that Syracuse s
               unique glory is its collection of the por-
               celains of its townswoman the only
               individual maker of art porcelain in this
               country, one of the.few—the very few

               tain such prominence in ceramics. All

               <p>Clearly, Robineau was not one to be

               fidence in her craft was further shown
               in an article she wrote for The Art
               World in 1917:</p>
               <quote>This fascinating work unfortunately is
               not a paying proposition, but it has
               given me the satisfaction of doing orig
               inal work, work which has not been
               done in this country before and may not
               be done again. . . . I often dream of all
               the things I would have done if I had
               begun earlier in life or if I had been fi-
               nancially independent so that 1 could
               have devoted myself entirely to my por-
               celains. The pieces I have produced are
               few in number, but they represent in
               design and shape the best that was in
               me and I hope that some of them may
               be an inspiration to some artist of the
               future, who perhaps will be able to do
               more and better work than 1 have

               Adelaide Alsop Robineau need not
               have been so modest. Just as she pre-
               dicted, Syracuse does consider her
               work one of its glories. The Everson
               Museum still celebrates her memory in
               its regular Ceramics Exhibitions,
               inaugurated in her honor in 1932.
               Nearly half a century after her death
               she is admired by aspiring artists who
               covet the perfection of the “Poppy
               Vase or “The Viking Ship, or one of
               the unnamed but brilliant crystalline-
               glazed vases. She was a high-fire porce-
               lain maker, a “high-fire person and an
               artist of the highest caliber.</p>

               All the unsatisfactory pieces were re-
               glazed and refired until they came out
               good or (were) entirely spoiled. (Sam-

               <byline>Martha Kelle</byline>
               <p>Women comprised about a third of the student bodv of the Bauhaus, the famous 1920s experiment in an
               education, and about ten percent of the faculty.' Through the writings of these women, we can see the politics               
               of the craft/art split in their time—the sexual division of materials, the rejection of the cult of personalityla
               affirmation of anonymity), the struggle to amalgamate art and craft into a larger social sphere via industr
               etc. These issues are of continuing interest today—for artists, teachers and feminists.</p>
            
               After six months in the preliminary Bauhaus course, students moved on to one of seven workshops in crafts
               The workshop organization was sometimes diagramed in circular form to avoid the implication of a hier
               archy. Let's look at where women worked in a Bauhaus linear listing:</p>

               What were the sociopolitical implications
               of the fact that most of these women were
               relegated to the weaving workshop? Anni
               Albers at first objected to being there.
               I was tempted by the glass workshop. Un-
               fortunately it was decided that no other stu
               dents could be admitted for work there. ..
               Weaving? Weaving I thought was too sissy.
               I was looking for a real job; I went into
               weaving unenthusiastically as merely the
               least objectionable choice . .. Gradually
               threads caught my imagination.
               Helene Nonne-Schmidt, writing in the
               Leipzig journal Vivos voco in 1926, saw the
               role of women in weaving as an affirmation
               of a traditional women’s art, but today her
               position has sexist implications.
               The artistically active woman applies hersel)
               most often and most successfully to work in
               a two-dimensional plane. This observation
               can be explained by her lack of the spatia
               imagination characteristic of men. Of course
               there are individual differences and differ-
               ences of degree here, just as the nature o)
               the sexes seldom is either purely masculine
               or feminine. In addition, the way the wom-
               an sees is, so to speak, childlike, because
               like a child she sees the details instead of the
               over-all picture. The woman’s way of seeing</p>

               things is not to be taken as a deficiency
               rather it is simply the way she is constituted
               and it enables her to pick up the richness o
               nuances which are lost to the more compre
               hensive view. But let us not deceive our
               selves into thinking this aspect of her nature
               will change, despite all the accomplishments
               of the Women’s Movement and despite al
               the investigations and experiments. There
               are even indications that woman is counting
               on her limitations, considering them a greal
               advantage...
               Within the Bauhaus and its workshops the
               woman is primarily interested in the work o
               the weaving workshop and there finds the
               widest range of opportunities. Weaving rep-
               resents the fusion of an infinite multiplicit)
               to unity, the interlocking of many threads to
               make up a fabric. It is quite evident to wha
               extent this field of work is appropriate to a
               woman and her talents.
               The ability of woman to become absorbed in
               detail and her interest in experimental
               "play" with surfaces suit her for this work
               What were some other political implica
               tions of the fact that weaving was, as Gunta
               Stölzl put it, “primarily a woman’s field ol
               work?” One answer that comes up is the</p>

               als are “higher than others; paint, bronze
               and marble are distinguished from “low

               In this regard, the Bauhaus attitude seemed
               crucial and ironic. On the one hand there
               was the declaration about raising no “arro-
               gant barrier between artist and craftsman.
               On the other, a barrier was raised within the
               crafts, though a few women circumvented
               it. And it seems significant that the weaving
               workshop was at the bottom of a (not alpha-
               betical) list of workshops offered in the first
               brochure published by the Bauhaus.
               The career of Anni Albers expresses some
               of the irony of the Bauhaus attitude. Albers,
               who studied painting before entering the
               Bauhaus, had a long successful career as a
               weaver and teacher, but since 1965 she has
               turned to another art form, printmaking. It
               is as though, after fighting to prove that
               weaving is an art, she has given up. “Weav-
               ing, she said in a recent interview with
               Gene Baro, “is not generally recognized as
               an art, but as a craft. I find that when the
               work is made with threads, it’s considered a
               craft; when it s on paper, it’s considered
               art. Yet Albers’s early writings abound
               with support of the Bauhaus’s unpreju-
               diced attitude towards materials and their
               inherent capacities. She explains this atti-
               tude in numerous instances that relate as
               well to anonymity in design.
               .. . all art is form in some material . . .
               Any material is good enough for art.
               Design is often regarded as the form im-
               posed on the material by the designer. But is
               we, as designers, cooperate with the mater-
               ial, treat it democratically, you might say
               we will reach a less subjective solution of
               this problem of form and therefore a more
               inclusive and permanent one. The less we,
               as designers, exhibit in our work our per-
               sonal traits, our likes and dislikes, our pe-
               culiarities and idiosyncrasies, in short, our
               individuality, the more balanced the form
               we arrive at will be. It is better that the
               material speaks than that we speak our-
               selves. The design that shouts “I am a pro-
               duct of Mr. X” is a bad design. As consum-
               ers, we are not interested in Mr. X but in his
               product, which we want to be our servant
               and not his personal ambassador. Now, if
               we sit at our desk designing, we cannot
               avoid exhibiting ourselves for we are exclud-
               ing the material as our co-worker, as the di
               rective force in our planning.
               What about the women in areas other
               than weaving? Margarete Sachsenberg was
               business manager of the Bauhaus from
               1926-1932, organized the transfer of the
               Bauhaus to Berlin and set up the adminis-
               tration there. Gerda Marx was a physical
               education instructor. In 1932, supervision of</p>
            <p>
               the interior design workshop and seminar
               was assigned to Lilli Reich; before this, she
               was Mies van der Rohe s closest associate as
               an interior designer. When he was director
               of the Bauhaus, van der Rohe appointed her
               to direct the weaving workshop as well.
               Reich was among the last group of faculty in
               Berlin who voted to close the Bauhaus
               under pressure from the Nazi regime.
               The work of a woman in the cabinet-
               making workshop was one of the first Bau-
               haus products to receive favorable public
               response. Alma Buscher’s design for child-
               ren s furniture was “thought out equally
               well with respect to practicality, economy
               and form. When she designed a toy cab-
               inet, it was made for children to play and
               build with; most of it could be taken apart
               and reassembled.
               In the metal workshop, Marianne Brandt
               studied with Moholy-Nagy.
               At first I was not accepted with pleasure-
               there was no place for a woman in a metal
               workshop, they felt. They admitted this to
               me later on and meanwhile expressed their
               displeasure by giving me all sorts of dull,
               dreary work. How many little hemispheres
               did I most patiently hammer out of brittle
               new silver, thinking that was the way it had
               to be and all beginnings are hard. Later
               things settled down and we got along well
               together.
               Illustrations of Brandt’s work in indus-
               trial design can be seen in Wingler s Bau-
               haus: globe lighting fixtures, her famous
               Kandem lamp, egg cooker, tea and coffee
               set. A number of these works—along with
               weavings by Stölzl and Albers—are in the
               Museum of Modern Art’s permanent collec-
               tion.
               Through Alma Mahler, Walter Gropius
               (founder of the Bauhaus) met Johannes It-
               ten and appointed him teacher of the first
               preliminary course at the Bauhaus.
               Through Itten s influence, Gertrude Gru-
               now was hired to teach “Studies in Har-
               mony.
               Fifty-five years old at the time of her ap-
               pointment, Grunow was a woman of
               ’strong spiritual force” with extraordinary
               ability to empathize with students— an
               intuitively sure hand in dealing with young
               people. Felix Klee referred to her as “the
               good spirit of the Bauhaus.”12 According to
               her synesthetic thinking, one basic entity,
               the same original phenomenon, is per
               ceivable in sound, color and form. Her quo-
               tation is from a Bauhaus publication."
               The supreme law, according to which all
               order is structured, is called equilibrium.
               Nature, having placed the organ of equilib-
               rium in the ear, has given man a guardian
               and protector of order, the ear thus being
               designated to be the immediate and highest
               judge of order within the organism. The</p>

               strong effects that sounds have on man can
               be attributed to equilibrium. The ear, dur-
               ing strain on the organism, senses the living
               order of that organism in its own specific,
               highest form of sensation, namely as sound
               (of any kind, even noise). Every living force,
               and thus every color, corresponds to a law-
               ful order, to a sound . ..
               Further, with regard to the “weight” of
               color:
               The act of weighing derives from the mind
               judiciously, progressing materially from
               the heaviest, the structurally firmest to the
               lightest, most ephemeral, most flexible. The
               scales and degrees increase and once more
               require a special order of colors (forces).
               The order of colors . . . occurs as a circular
               one and constitutes an outward oriented
               tension of forces . . . The circle, a circle of
               gravity and equilibrium . . . is a fundamen-
               tal phenomenon and is of the same impor-
               tance to statics as the golden section had
               been for measurement.
               Finally, let’s look at the view of Bauhaus
               women on the community of the Bau-
               haus; somehow the social organization of
               the Bauhaus enhanced its influence. Anni
               Albers describes it as
               ... a creative vacuum . . . unformalized,
               unformulated, even contradictory in its var-
               ious areas.
               Called by Felix Klee, our Bauhaus
               mother,”15 Tut Schlemmer, wife of the the-
               ater director Oskar Schlemmer, described
               the climate of the Bauhaus as “like being on
               top of a volcano.”16 She recalled:
               the continuous unrest that forced everyone
               to express a fundamental opinion of pro-
               found problems almost daily . . . It was
               wild and enthusiastic . .. Boys had long
               hair, girls short skirts. No collars or stock
               ings were worn, which was shocking and ex-
               travagant then .. . We developed a Bau-
               haus dance—a kind of hop expressing the
               joy of living. . .. In retrospect I believe I
               understand the secret of how the Bauhaus
               could develop in the face of incredible diffi-
               culties; we simply loved it . . . and felt re-
               sponsible."
               One gets a feeling here for the “unity in
               diversity” that Gropius described as an ob-
               jective of the Bauhaus. Lou Scheper, who
               participated in Klee’s course and Schlem-
               mer’s theater as well as in Itten’s mural
               workshop, said:
               This community corresponded neither to
               the concept “commune nor the concept
               “cloister, even though individual Bauhaus
               people preferred the ascetic’s cell. The Bau
               haus community was the sum of significant,
               independent individuals who could develop
               more richly in association than in isolation
               .. . One talked "big"—of the postwar mood
               of political hope and artistic expectations, of
               the search for the unified work of art. Play</p>
            <p>
               and creative imagination and also a tenden
               cy toward mysticism, even to spiritual fai
               healing and to sectarianism and in additio
               a delight in nature taken from the yout
               movement are the badge of Bauhaus mem
               bers of that time, who were more artist
               than technicians, more craftsmen than con
               structors. It was only later that . .. th
               Cathedral of Socialism was replaced by...
               Art and Technology. Though the Bauhaus
               had originally started to produce unique,
               handcrafted pieces, it later developed ..
               the models for industrially produced art
               cles. Both were products of the same feeling
               for form, the sense of function and mater
               ials, and both were a consequence draun
               from the social tasks of the time.
               The craft areas of the Bauhaus (as re-
               flected in its name, meaning “Building-
               House”) were conceived to produce a uni
               fied architectural whole. Women largel
               were consigned to the additive craft
               while men worked in the structural “essen-
               tial” areas. Women, except for Lou
               Scheper, worked with soft or malleable ma-
               terials, and on objects that were mobile (fur-
               niture, weaving) rather than structurally
               permanent. Although the Bauhaus is gen-
               erally regarded as the most innovative art
               school of the twentieth century, its sexual
               division of craft continued traditional ideas
               about women’s work and men’s work.

               <head><title>PORTRAIT OF FRIDA KAHLO AS A TEHUANA</title></head>
               <byline>Hayden Herrera</byline>
            <p>
               Frida Kahlo (1910-1954) was one of those
               strong, vivid people who surmounts all sorts
               of odds. Unrestrained by her native Mex
               ico's male-dominant culture, Kahlo did
               pretty much what she pleased. Though she
               was best known as the wife of the renowned
               muralist, Diego Rivera, she was admired as
               a highly original painter whose work
               pursued totally different goals from her hus-
               band’s. While Rivera broadcast public mes-
               sages on public walls, Frida Kahlo painted
               intensely personal images on small pieces of
               tin. At 15 Kahlo was crippled for life by a
               bus accident that almost killed her; yet she
               became famous for her heroic “allegría.
               She led a full and complex life, traveling to
               the United States and to France where she
               exhibited her paintings. Her house in the
               Mexico City suburb of Coyoacan, now the
               Frida Kahlo Museum, was a mecca for
               visiting dignitaries; the Riveras entertained
               everybody from Leon Trotsky to André
               Breton to Sergei Eisenstein.</p>
               <p>But what perhaps most attracts the atten-
               tion of people today is Kahlo’s painting.
               The majority of her paintings are self-
               portraits, the most accessible subject for
               someone who spent her life in and out of
               hospitals and did much of her painting in
               bed. Self-portraits were a way of confront-
               ing, confirming and extending her reality.
               Kahlo depicted precisely what was going on
               in her life—birth, abortion, miscarriage
               love, divorce, surgical operations, political
               passions, thoughts of death—with astonish-
               ing honesty. The result is a lasting record of
               female experience that strikes many reson-
               ances today. Indeed, Frida Kahlo has be-
               come something of a role model for women
               artists both in the United States and in Mexico.</p>
               <p>Anyone looking at her photograph and
               Self-Portrait (1948) can see that Kahlo was
               a striking beauty. With her full lips, pierc-
               ing black eyes and heavy connecting brows,
               she would have attracted attention any
               where. But she enhanced her exotic appear-
               ance by choosing as her daily attire the
               costume of the women from the Isthmus of
               Tehuantepec—an embroidered blouse and a
               long skirt of purple or red velvet with a ruff-
               led hem. In many self-portraits, Kahlo
               wears an elaborate Tehuana headdress that
               drapes over her shoulders like a shawl and
               frames her face with pleats of starched lace
               reminiscent of an outsized Elizabethan ruff.
               Frida Kahlo arranged her hair in intricate
               Mexican hairdos decorated with ribbons,
               clips, combs and flowers. She adored
               jewelry, and her hands were a constantly
               changing exhibition of rings. In U.S. cities
               and in Paris, Frida Kahlo was a traffic stop-
               per and a hostess’s delight. Art dealer Julien
               Levy remembers the commotion Frida
               Kahlo once created in a Manhattan bank
               when she walked in followed by a pack of
               children crying, “Where is the circus?</p>
               <p>Kahlo did not choose her picturesque
               clothing simply out of exhibitionism, though
               a taste for spectacle may well have been part
               of her motive. As her self-portraits in
               Tehuana costumes show, her reasons for
               dressing that way were complex. If one com-
               pares Frida Kahlo’s self-portraits as a
               Tehuana with the depictions of women in
               Mexican costumes by the nineteenth-
               century “Costumbrista painters, or even
               with Diego Rivera’s portrait of Frida as a
               Tehuana in a San Francisco mural, one de
               tects something intensely charged and
               peculiar in the relationship between Kahlo
               and her costume. In some paintings, her
               Tehuana dress hangs empty, without Frida
               in it. The costume seems to have little to do               
               with local color and much to do with a dis-
               junctive sense of her own identity. Sur-
               rounded by the lace headdress, for example,
               her dark, slightly mustachioed face looks
               perverse and even demonic. Her features
               are determinedly composed and yet brim-
               ming with emotion.</p>
               <p>On the simplest level, Frida Kahlo might
               have dressed in Tehuana costumes because
               she loved exotic objects that brought the
               aura of distant places to the confinement of
               her Mexico City home. Perhaps because she
               was an invalid and acutely aware of the fra-
               gility of her hold on life, Frida Kahlo had a
               strong love for material objects. She
               amassed a large collection of “little
               things"—dolls, toys of clay or straw,
               costumes, jewelry, pre-Columbian idols and
               all kinds of popular art. She relished the
               concreteness of these objects, 1 suspect, as
               well as their novelty or visual appeal.
               Kahlo’s friends recall the pleasure she took
               in the presents they brought her. Souvenirs
               of other people’s wanderings must have
               precipitated imaginary voyages in her mind.
               Two years after her bus accident, seventeen-
               year-old Frida wrote to a friend, “My
               greatest desire for a long time has been to
               travel. All that is left to me is the melancho-
               ly of those who have read travel books.</p>
               <p>Most likely she was not consciously iden-
               tifying with any specific ethnic myth when
               she chose the Tehuana costume from the
               many regional costumes Mexico has to of-
               fer. (Kahlo did sometimes wear costumes
               from other areas of her country as well.)
               Tehuantepec women are famous for being
               stately, beautiful, smart, brave and strong;
               according to legend, theirs is a matriarchal
               society where women run the markets, han-
               dle fiscal matters and dominate the men. Al-
               though association with these characteristics</p>
            <pb facs="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BucknellDSC/heresies/main/issue04/images/Heresies_04_061.jpg" n="61" xml:id="img_0061"/>
            <p>
               would not have displeased Frida Kahlo—it
               probably would have amused her—her
               selection of the Tehuana costume simply be-
               cause it was pretty and festive would be
               more in character. In fact, she said she wore
               it out of coquetry: she wanted the long
               swaying skirts to conceal a limp caused by a
               bout with polio at the age of six that left one
               leg longer than the other; she also wanted
               the costume to hide her injured foot.</p>
               <p>Besides disguising defects, wearing the
               Tehuana costume expressed a point of view.
               It was a statement of Kahlo’s passionate
               identification with her Mexican heritage, an
               identification stressed by Kahlo’s witty, but
               consciously vulgar, marketplace manner of
               speaking. Although her father was a Ger-
               man Jew of Austro-Hungarian descent and
               her mother a Mexican of mixed Spanish and
               Indian extraction, Frida Kahlo emphasized
               the Indian in her ancestry. The value Kahlo
               set on all things native and on all things
               made by what she called “la raza (the
               people) was shared by her husband Diego
               Rivera and by a whole generation of artists
               and intellectuals in post-revolutionary Mex-
               ico. Their fervent “Mexicanismo went
               hand in hand with the adoption of a certain
               primitivism of style and subject matter in
               the arts. The folkloric impulse in Mexican
               culture of this period can be taken as a gen-
               erally leftist, anticolonialist political state-
               ment. Nativism also led to an enthusiastic
               investigation of the popular arts—including
               regional costumes. When Anna Pavlova
               danced a Mexican ballet in Mexico City,
               she wore a native costume. It was not long
               before sophisticated urban women adopted
               the idea for everyday fashion. For example,
               the Riveras’ friend, the painter and photo-
               grapher, Rosa Rolando (born in Los
               Angeles) managed to look more Tehuana
               than the Tehuanas by braiding her hair and
               wearing Tehuana garb. Her husband
               Miguel Covarrubias, the writer, painter and
               cartoonist for Vanity Fair, helped to
               popularize this “Indian look when he
               wrote rhapsodically about the Tehuanas in
               Mexico South, published in 1946.</p>
               <p>In the 1940s, the cult of Indianism spread
               to bohemian milieus in the United States. I
               suspect that both for Frida Kahlo and for
               urban women in other parts of the world,
               dressing in peasant costumes had to do with
               the notion that the peasant is more earth-
               bound and therefore more deeply sensual
               than the urban sophisticate. To dress in this
               exotic way, instead of wearing tailored city
               clothes, gave women a sense of abandon, a
               permission to feel uninhibited about their
               bodies. Men liked women to dress in
               peasant styles too, for in a sense this cloth-
               ing joined the idea of the earthy, sexual
               peasant to the idea of the female as nature,
               not culture. Thus by wearing Indian cos-
               tumes women declared their primitive con-
               nection with nature and their own sexuality.
               In addition, there is a political dimension to
               their identification with this popular art
               form. As usually happens when folk cos-
               tumes are adopted by sophisticated people,
               this peasant style did not catch on with men,
               in Mexico or in the United States. Diego
               Rivera, for example, chose to wear denim=
               worker’s overalls, not the familiar white
               shirt and pants of the Mexican Indian, to
               assert his espousal of antibourgeois values.
               Similarly, in some of her more specifically
               political moments, Frida Kahlo cropped her
               hair like a boy and wore denim skirts and
               work shirts decorated with the Communist
               star or the hammer and sickle.</p>
               <p>Rivera loved the look of the Tehuanas
               and he brought back costumes for Frida
               from his trips to Tehuantepec. His enthus-
               iasm for Tehuanas is seen in a series of oil
               paintings of Tehuantepec women he painted
               in 1929, the year he married Frida. (Tehu-
               anas also appear in his murals and in a 1935
               series of watercolors of Tehuantepec scenes.)
               Very possibly Frida Kahlo caught Diego s
               enthusiasm. Before she married, Kahlo
               dressed in European-style clothes. Her first
               self-portrait (1926) shows her as an elegantly
               dressed woman. But, what was unusual for
               those times, she occasionally wore pants,
               perhaps to cover the scars from her acci-
               dent. It was only after her marriage that
               Frida began to dress and to paint herself as
               a Tehuana, and it is likely that she did this
               to please her husband as well as to please
               herself. Perhaps significantly, Frida ex-
               plained that the Tehuana Frida in her dou-
               ble self-portait, The Two Fridas (1939), was
               the Frida Diego had loved, while the Frida
               in the white, European-style, Victorian
               dress was the Frida Diego had stopped lov-
               ing during the year they were divorced. The
               possibility that Frida Kahlo wore Tehuana
               costumes partly to please Diego is also sug-
               gested in Self-Portrait with Cropped Hair
               (1940), likewise painted during her divorce
               from Diego. Here she has cut off her long
               hair and dressed herself in a man’s suit large
               enough to have been Diego s. By destroying
               attributes of sexuality (the long hair and Te-
               huana clothes that gave pleasure to the man
               who had betrayed her), Frida has commit-
               ted a vengeful act that only serves to height-
               en her pain. (They remarried in 1940.)
               Frida became famous for looking like an
               Indian princess or a goddess. No doubt her
               eye-catching appearance delighted Diego,
               who revelled in publicity. He did not hesi-
               tate to make a political issue out of Fridas
               clothes, and once expounded to a Time
               magazine reporter:</p>
               <quote>The classic Mexican dress has been cre-
               ated by people for people. The Mexican
               women who do not wear it do not be-
               long to the people, but are mentally
               and emotionally dependent on a foreign
               class to which they wish to belong, i.e.,
               the great American and French bur-
               eaucracy.1</quote>
               <p>Frida Kahlo, said Rivera, exaggerating as
               was his wont, had worn only Mexican
               clothes for 22 years. Nevertheless, he was
               thrilled with the effect of Frida’s appear-
               ance on bourgeois Paris; when she went to
               Paris in 1938 for an exhibition organized for
               her by André Breton, Schiaparelli designed
               a decidedly haute couture robe Madame
               Rivera.</p>
               <p>By wearing the Tehuana costume, Frida
               Kahlo created an art object of her scarred
               and crippled body, and she helped to make
               herself a living myth. Perhaps the elaborate
               packaging was an attempt to compensate for
               her body s deficiencies and for her sense of
               fragmentation, dissolution and imminent
               death. A costume can make the wearer feel
               more visible, more emphatically present as a
               physical object in space. For a frail, ofter
               bedridden woman, this need to establish a
               theatrical physical presence to confirm her
               existence must have been strong. Surely this
               was one of the reasons why Kahlo painted
               herself so many times.</p>
               <p>In addition, the flamboyant costumes.
               together with Frida’s allegria and aston-
               ishingly direct, earthy behavior, might have
               been antidotes to the pull of introversion. As
               her many self-portraits show, Frida Kahlo
               spent much of her time investigating and
               communing with herself. Her costumes
               might also have been distancing mechan-
               isms. They may have allowed Kahlo to dis-
               sociate herself somewhat from the painful
               aspects of her reality. And by wearing color-
               ful costumes Frida could distract friends’ at-
               tention from her physical suffering. In her
               self-portraits, tears always signal physical or
               mental pain, but Frida s features always are
               unflinching. Her self-portraits are charged
               with a strange tension because of the contra-
               dictions between her festive exterior and
               suffering interior. Perhaps Frida Kahlo hid
               behind the exquisite decorative object that
               she presented to the world. The Tehuana
               costumes were for her both mask and frame.</p>

               FEMINISM: HAS IT CHANGED ART HISTORY?
               “Until now, no one has been serious and pas-
               sionate, and certainly no one has been argumen-
               tative, concerning attitudes toward women.
               (1969)
               Cynthia Gornick, “Women and Creativity</p>
            <p>
               Mary D. Garrard</p>
            <p>
               In what way has the discipline of art history been affected
               by feminism and women’s studies?
               On one level the answer is obvious. We all know a great
               deal more about women artists of the past than we did even
               five years ago, thanks to the efforts of a growing number of
               scholars who are devoting their research skills to this area.
               Yet for the most part, this new knowledge remains
               hermetically sealed in its own world, not touching and often
               not touched by traditional methods and assumptions of the
               discipline. Women artists are discussed in courses on women
               artists, are written about in feminist journals, are grouped in
               single-sex exhibitions, and if I sound churlish about these ac-
               tivities, which surely have their positive effects, it is only
               with apprehension that we will all—feminist historians, ar-
               tists and critics—remain trapped in a great cultural ghetto of
               our own devising if we do not now begin to force the issue of
               integration. It is indeed time to put women artists in the
               regular art history curriculum, and most important, in the
               standard survey textbooks, so they can be seen by the next
               generation of students as natural phenomena, and not exotio
               hothouse plants.
               But there are other questions for art history raised by
               feminism. How has thinking changed? Should it not have
               changed? A generation of scholars in the early twentieth cen
               tury were prompted by their response to the Expressionism
               of their own era to re-examine early sixteenth century Man-
               nerism, and to appraise it positively for the first time. New
               wine in old bottles, art historically speaking, is a fresh and
               more complete understanding of the monuments of the past
               made possible by the analogous, yet genuinely new thought
               of the present. But where are the Friedlaenders of feminism?
               Why, now that we see the distorted attitudes and behavior of
               men and women in the past with a clarity that Plato s
               cavedwellers would have envied, are we not re-examining the
               relationship between such artificial, stereotyped behavior
               patterns and the art produced by those who believed in
               them?
               We can, of course, press the Mannerist analogy far enough</p>
            <p>
               to see the danger of imposing modern consciousness on pre-
               modern cultures. The heavy emphasis upon Angst that ac-
               companies much analytic writing on Mannerism in the 1920s
               is a prime example of such projection. Similarly, we would
               be foolish to look for feminist statements in the work of
               lady” artists of the Renaissance who never questioned the
               social order of their day. Undoubtedly discoveries are yet to
               be made about particular works—a Judith Leyster here, an
               Artemisia Gentileschi there—in which the woman artist
               turns a traditional iconographic formula upside down to ex-
               press a distinguishably female point of view. But not even
               this is the terra incognita we should be charting if we expect
               art history to be influenced by our thinking.
               There are two ways of looking at the history of attitudes
               toward women in art. One—the only one thus far explored-
               is to compensate for the lack of scholarly attention to women
               artists’ achievements by writing as apologists. Gabrielle
               Munter was unjustly overshadowed by Kandinsky; Jeanne-
               Elisabeth Chaudet was sentimental, but so was Greuze, they
               all painted flowers and portraits because they didn’t have ac-
               cess to the nude model, and so on. All of this is perfectly true,
               but is a lament from the ghetto, and it will not get us out be-
               cause it is defensive. The other way is to approach the histor-
               ic fact of discrimination against women from the other end-
               what has this politics of exclusion meant for male art? After
               all, despite the numerical hegemony of male artists, theirs is
               ultimately an art produced by only one of two sexes, and far
               from being universal, it is rampant with the prejudices, van-
               ities, insecurities and fears that afflict mere men as well as
               mere women.
               We have been sensitized for nearly ten years now to the
               fact that the image of each sex in art, and of their interaction,
               has been overwhelmingly a male perception, and as such, a
               grab-bag of aspirations, fantasies and neuroses, individual
               and collective. But if one looks, for instance, through the
               past five years of the Art Bulletin, it is virtually impossible to
               see that this understanding has affected the way scholars
               look at their subjects. One of the very few exceptions, Norma</p>

               Broude’s article in the March 1977 issue, which debunks the
               traditional view of Degas as misogynist, met with strong
               editorial resistance before it was accepted and was first
               dismissed as a “women’s lib tract.” Such irrational reaction
               to logical revisions of thought stimulated by feminism ulti-
               mately bespeaks a bunker mentality, a stubborn, last-ditch
               effort to keep women and attitudes about them outside art
               history. And this in the discipline that deals with the human
               experience in its visual, most immediate manifestation.
               Resistance by men to the idea of women’s equality has
               produced mixed results in men’s art. On the positive side, the
               sense of superiority is often the mainstay of an elitist perspec-
               tive that makes art of some sorts possible. One could serious-
               ly argue that the Greek’s superb confidence in himself as the
               measure of things was buoyed by his conviction that his wife
               was a far less perfect yardstick. The Parthenon is not just the
               triumphant result of that self-esteem, it does not even reflect-
               ed a glimmer of bad conscience. On the other hand, the no-
               tion that females, and by extension that which is feminine in
               art, are inherently inferior has contaminated art historical
               thinking in curious ways.
               Why is our art history, for example, full of virtuous rever-
               sals, in which a virile, heroic or austere style suddenly and
               dramatically replaces a feminine, lyrical or luxurious one-
               David over Fragonard, Caravaggio over Salviati, clean In-
               ternational Modern Gropius over wickedly ornamental Sulli-
               van or Tiffany? Does it never go the other way? Who ever
               heard of a drastic hedonistic reaction to unbridled stoicism?
               The ornamental and feminine in art are seen as a kind of
               creeping sickness that gradually weakens the fabric of ster
               resolve until the virile essence has been fatally co-opted and
               must forcefully reassert itself. Hercules cleaning the Augean
               stables is heroic, his submission to Omphale shameful, and
               when he must choose between virtue and pleasure, we al-
               ready know the contest is rigged. Yet in explaining all this, it
               is not enough to point to the Western philosophical bias to fa-
               vor the moral over the pleasurable; we must also account for
               the equally deep-rooted attitude that identifies male with
               purposeful and female with corruptive. This kind of thinking
               has infected value judgments in art history in subtle ways,
               one fears, but to choose an unsubtle instance, such "“femin-
               ine styles as Maniera or Rococo, and all the decorative arts,
               have had to be defended against the supposedly devastating
               charge of frivolity, as if art were not the one sphere of our
               lives in which play is serious.
               It is possible, though no one has done so, to view the art of
               early Mannerism as a reaction against not the style of the
               High Renaissance, but its high moral (read masculine) ideal-
               ism. A couple of years ago, 1 began to look at Rosso Rioren-
               tino’s Moses Defending the Daughters of Jethro in a new
               way—as a comic parody of such paragons of virility in action
               as Michelangelo s Battle Cartoon, which was its point of de-
               parture. I do not know if Rosso intended it as parody, but
               the painting works as a commentary on the obsessive Renais-
               sance adoration of the heroic male nude and the glory of bat-
               tle, with its mock-heroic, tough little boy defenders and its</p>
            <p>
               kewpie-doll heroine. It is hilarious. Yet it is only possible to
               see the painting in this way if you take the heretical position
               that male heroism does not have an absolute value, but in an
               extreme form is subject to ridicule. No woman can walk
               around Florence today without some slight impulse to laugh
               at the material evidence of such an unabashedly phallocen-
               tric culture. Though fewer statues filled the squares in his
               day, Rosso quite conceivably had the same impulse.
               Writers on early Mannerism, on the other hand, have not
               been able to postulate any conceivable reason for rejecting a
               heroic idealism other than a wish to explore its formalist po-
               tential. Friedlaender explains that Rosso’s painting “is not
               formulated in terms of psychic depth, but is built on a purely
               aesthetic basis of form, color, et cetera, et cetera. Sydney
               Freedberg predictably discusses the work largely in formalist
               terms, and for him, the picture has not one but two contents,
               with Rosso relegating mannered grace and subtly distilled
               sensuality . . . to the feminine and minor components of the
               picture, and exploiting the subject’s possibilities of violence
               instead.”2 By identifying the “subject” with the male actors
               only, Freedberg mimics the very male solipsist attitude that
               Rosso appears to ridicule. Most of all, it is strange that writ-
               ers responsive to the expressive shift from the calm serious-
               ness of Andrea del Sarto to the hyperintensity of Pontorme
               should draw a blank on Rosso’s expressive tone. Strange, un-
               til one reflects that neither formalist manipulation nor
               heightened emotional intensity challenge any underlying so-
               cial assumptions. Antiheroic parody, on the other hand, calls
               into question an entire set of values, revealing the Apollo-
               David-Hercules images that symbolize such values to be as
               extreme in one direction as fainting Victorian heroines are in
               another.
               We have before us the prospect of an art history that takes
               sexual attitudes into account as subjective values and value
               judgments, rather than as absolute articles of faith. These
               values can be examined and assessed as part of the content of
               a work of art, factors often just as relevant to our under-
               standing of it as other factors that we routinely take serious-
               ly—military history, theological doctrine or social mores.
               Also, we are now in a position to recognize and discredit
               scholarly writing in which sexual stereotypes are imposed on
               material to which they are irrelevant. To seize these oppor-
               tunities afforded by feminist insight is an exciting prospect,
               but more than that, it is a professional responsibility that
               should now be shared by all art historians, male and female
               alike.</p>

               Are You a
               Closet Collector?
               I am a compulsive collector. Having just
               concluded a small survey, I now know
               that this is true of other women artists as
               well. These lists were made by people
               who don’t admit to collecting” as much
               as they do to saving” or not throwing
               anything away.
               I asked a number of women to let us in
               on their secrets. The letter of inquiry was
               sent—xeroxed copies were made by the
               women who (in the tradition of the chain
               stitch xxx letter) reached other women.
               When the replies came in I realized that
               people save things that “touch” them
               rather than things which display the
               "proper touch"
               The survey showed that savers are not
               comfortable about their hoards and that
               artists provide the highest rationale for
               not throwing anything away; they save so
               that they can incorporate their junk in-
               to their art. No one can fault a moral
               glutton.
               Underneath all of this collecting there is a
               strong emotional tie to a specific experi-
               ence. A physical diary in a sense. A wom-
               an’s personal history, her humanity, her
               old postcards, succulents, charms for
               bracelets, ticket stubs, anything free ...
               lite itself has to be saved.

               Making Something from Nothing
               (Toward a Definition of Women’s “Hobby Art”)
               Lucy R. Lippard</p>
            <p>
               In 1968 Rubye Mae Griffith and
               Frank B. Griffith published a “hobby
               book called How To Make Something
               from Nothing. On the cover (where it
               would sell books) his name was listed
               before hers, while on the title page
               (where it could do no harm), hers ap-
               peared before his. It is tempting to
               think that it was she who wrote the
               crypto-feminist dedication: “To the
               nothings—with the courage to turn into
               somethings.” The book itself is con-
               cerned with transformation—of tin
               cans, beef knuckle bones, old razor
               blades, breadbaskets and bottlecaps in-
               to more and less useful and decorative
               items. As “A Word in Parting,” the
               authors state their modest credo: “This
               book . . . is simply a collection of ideas
               intended to encourage your ideas ..
               We want you to do things your way...
               Making nothings into somethings is a
               highly inventive sport but because it is
               inventive and spontaneous and origina.
               it releases tensions, unties knots of
               frustration, gives you a wonderful sense
               of pleasure and accomplishment. So ex
               periment, dare, improvise—enjoy every
               minute—and maybe you’Il discover, as
               we did, that once you start making
               something from nothing, you find you
               can’t stop, and what’s more you don’t
               want to stop!
               Despite the tone and the emphasis on
               enjoyment—unpopular in serious cir-
               cles—this “sport” sounds very much
               like fine or “high” art. Why then are its
               products not art? “Lack of quality
               will be the first answer offered, and
               “derivative” the second, even though
               both would equally apply to most of the
               more sophisticated works seen in galler-
               ies and museums. If art is popularly
               defined as a unique and provocative
               object of beauty and imagination, the
               work of many of the best contemporary
               “fine” artists must be disqualified
               along with that of many “craftspeo-
               ple,” and in the eyes of the broad audi-</p>

            <p>
               ence, many of the talented hobbyist’s
               works would qualify. Yet many of these.
               in turn, would not even be called
               “crafts” by the purists in that field. Al-
               though it is true that all this name call-
               ing is a red herring, it makes me
               wonder whether high art by another
               name might be less intimidating and
               more appealing. On the other hand
               would high art by any other name look
               so impressive, be so respected and so
               commercially valued? I won’t try to
               answer these weighted queries here, but
               simply offer them as other ways of
               thinking about some of the less obvious
               aspects of the art of making.
               Much has been made of the need to
               erase false distinctions between art and
               craft, “fine” art and the “minor” arts.
               high” art and “low” art—distinctions
               that particularly affect women’s art.
               But there are also “high” crafts and
               “low” ones, and although women wield
               more power in the crafts world than in
               the fine art world, the same problems</p>

               plague both. The crafts need only on
               more step up the aesthetic and financi
               respectability ladder and they will
               headed for the craft museums rathe
               than for people’s homes.
               Perhaps until the character of the
               museums changes, anything ending up
               in one will remain a display of upper
               class taste in expensive and doubtfully
               “useful” objects. For most of this cen-
               tury, the prevailing relationship be
               tween art and “the masses” has been
               one of paternalistic noblesse oblige
               along the lines of “we who are educated
               to know what’s correct must pass our
               knowledge and good taste down to
               those who haven’t the taste, the time,
               or the money to know what is Good.
               Artists and craftspeople, from William
               Morris to de Stijl and the Russian Con-
               structivists, have dreamed of socialist
               Utopias where everyone’s life is im
               proved by cheap and beautiful objects
               and environments. Yet the path of the
               Museum of Modern Art’s design de-
               partment, also paved with good inten-
               tions, indicates the destination of such
               dreams in a capitalist consumer society.
               A pioneer in bringing to the public the
               best available in commercial design
               the Museum’s admirable display of
               such ready-mades as a handsome and
               durable 39c paring knife or a 69c coffee
               mug has mostly given way to installa
               tions more typical of Bonnier’s, DR, or
               some chic Italian furniture showroom.
               It is, as it so often is, a question of
               audience, as well as a question of cate-
               gorization. (One always follows the
               other.) Who sees these objects at
               MOMA? Mostly people who buy 83.00
               paring knives and 88.00 coffee muge
               which are often merely “elevated” ex-
               amples of the cheaper versions, with
               unnecessary refinements or simplifica
               tions. Good Taste is once again an eco-
               nomic captive of the classes who rule
               the culture and govern its institutions.

               who are uneducated enough to ignore
               or independent enough to reject the im-
               positions from above. Their lack of
               enthusiasm provides an excuse for the
               aesthetic philanthropists, their hands
               bitten, to stop feeding the masses.
               Class-determined good/bad taste pat-
               terns revert to type.
               Such is the process by which both
               design objects and the “high crafts
               have become precisely the consumer
               commodity that the rare socially con-
               scious “fine artist is struggling to
               avoid. Historically, craftspeople, whose
               work still exists on a less exalted equi-
               librium between function and com-
               merce, have been most aware of the
               contradictions inherent in the distinc-
               tion between art and crafts. The dis-
               tinction between design and “high
               crafts is a modern one. Both have their
               origins in the “low crafts of earlier
               periods, sometimes elevated to the level
               of “folk art” because of their usefulness
               as sources for “fine art. A “designer
               is simply the craftsperson of the techno-
               logical age, no longer forced to do her-
               his own making. The Bauhaus became
               the cradle of industrial design, but the
               tapestries, furniture, textiles and tea
               sets made there were still primarily
               works of art. Today, the most popular
               housewares all through the taste gamut
               of the American lower-middle to upper-
               middle class owe as much stylistically
               to the “primitive or “low crafts—
               Mexican, Asian, American Colonial—
               as to the streamlining of the interna-
               tional style. In fact, popular design
               tends to combine the two, which meet
               at a point of (often spurious) simplic-
               ity, and to become “kitsch —diluted
               examples of the Good Taste that is hid-
               den away in museums, expensive
               stores, and the homes of the wealthy,
               mnaccessible to everyone else.
               The hobby books reflect the manner
               in which Good Taste is still unarguably
               set forth by the class system. Different
               books are clearly aimed at different
               tastes, aspirations, educational levels.
               For instance, Dot Aldrich’s Creating
               with Cattails, Cones and Pods is not
               aimed at the inner city working-class
               housewife or welfare mother (who
               couldn’t afford the time or the mater
               ials) or at the farmer’s wife (who sees
               enough weeds in her daily work) but at
               the suburban upper middle-class wom-
               an who thinks in terms of “creating,
               has time on her hands and access to the
               materials. Aldrich is described on the
               dust jacket as a garden club member, a
               naturalist, and an artist; the book is il-
               lustrated by her daughter. She very
               thoroughly details the construction of
               dollhouse furniture, corsages and</p>
            <p>
               arrangements” from dried plants and
               an occasional orange peel. Her taste is
               firmly placed as good” within her
               class, although it might be seen as
               gauche “homemade art” by the upper
               class and ugly and undecorative by the
               working class.
               Hazel Pearson Williams Feather
               Flowers and Arrangements, on the
               other hand, has the sleazy look of a
               mail-order catalogue; it is one of a craft
               course series and its fans, birdcages,
               butterflies and candles are all made
               from garishly colored, rather than na-
               tural materials. The book is clearly
               aimed at a totally different audience,
               one that is presumed to respond to such
               colors and to have no aesthetic appreci-
               ation of the “intrinsic superiority of</p>

               natural materials over artificial ones
               not to mention an inability to afford
               them.
               The objects illustrated in books like
               the Griffiths are neither high art nor
               high craft nor design. Yet such books
               are myriad, and they are clearly aimed
               at women—the natural bricoleurs, as
               Deena Metzger has pointed out. The
               books are usually written by a woman.
               and if a man is co-author he always
               seems to be a husband, which adds a
               certain familial coziness and gives him
               an excuse for being involved in such
               blatantly female fripperies (as well as
               dignifying the frippery by his participa-
               tion). Necessity is the mother, not the
               father of invention. The home maker’s
               sense of care and touch focuses on sew-
               ing, cooking, interior decoration as
               often through conditioning as through
               necessity, providing a certain bond be-
               tween middle-class and working-class
               housewives and career women. (1 am
               talking about the making of the home,</p>
            <p>
               not just the keeping of it; “good
               housekeeping” is not a prerogative for
               creativity in the home. It might even be
               the opposite, since the “houseproud’
               woman is often prouder of her house,
               her container, than she is of herself.)
               Even these days women still tend to be
               brought up with an exaggerated sense
               of detail and a need to be “busy, often
               engendered by isolation within a par-
               ticular space, and by the emphasis on
               cleaning and service. A visually sen-
               sitive woman who spends day after day
               in the same rooms develops a compul-
               sion to change, adorn, expand them, an
               impetus encouraged by the “hobby
               books.
               The overdecoration of the home
               and the fondness for bric-a-brac often
               attributed to female fussiness or plain
               Bad Taste can just as well be attributed
               to creative restlessness. Since most
               homemade hobby objects are geared to-
               ward home improvement, they inspire
               less fear in their makers of being self-
               ish or self-indulgent, there is no
               confusion about pretentions to Art, and
               the woman is freed to make anything
               she can imagine. (At the same time it is
               true that the imagination is often stimu-
               lated by exposure to other such work,
               just as real” artists are similarly de-
               pendent on the art world and the works
               of their colleagues.) Making conversa-
               tion pieces” like deer antler salad tongs
               or a madonna in an abalone shell grot-
               to, or a mailbox from an old breadbox,
               or vice versa, can be a prelude to break
               ing with the “functional” excuse and
               the making of wholly “useless objects.
               Now that the homebound woman
               has a little more leisure, thanks to so-
               called labor-saving devices, her pas-
               times are more likely to be cultural in
               character. The less privileged she is,
               the more likely she is to keep her inter-
               ests inside the home with the focus of
               her art remaining the same as that of
               her work. The better off and better
               educated she is, the more likely she is to
               go outside of the home for influence or
               stimulus, to spend her time reading, go-
               ing to concerts, theatre, dance, staying
               well informed. If she is upwardly
               mobile, venturing from her own con-
               firmed tastes into foreign realms where
               she must be cautious about opinions
               and actions, her insecurity is likely to
               lead to the classic docility of the mid-
               dle-class audience, so receptive to what
               experts” tell them to think about the
               arts. The term culture vulture is un-
               derstood to apply mainly to upwardly
               mobile women. And culture, in the
               evangelical spirit of the work ethic, is
               often also inseparable from good
               works.</p>

            <p>
               Middle- and upper-class women, al-
               ways stronger in their support of “cul-
               ture than any other group, seem to
               need aesthetic experience in the broad-
               est sense more than men—perhaps be-
               cause the vital business of running the
               world, for which educated women, at
               least to some extent, have been pre-
               pared, has been denied them, and
               because they have the time and the
               background to think—but not the
               means to act. Despite the fact that mid-
               dle-class women have frequently been
               strong (and anonymous) forces for
               social justice, the earnestness and
               amateur status of such activities have
               been consistently ridiculed, from the
               Marx Brothers’ films to the cartoons of
               Helen Hokinson.
               Nevertheless, the League of Women
               Voters, the volunteer work for under-
               funded cultural organizations, the
               garden clubs, literary circles and
               discussion groups of the comfortable
               classes have been valid and sometimes
               courageous attempts to move out into
               the world while remaining sufficiently
               on the fringes of the system so as not to
               challenge its male core. The working-
               class counterparts are, for obvious
               reasons, aimed less at improving the lot
               of others than at improving one’s own,
               and, like hobby art, are more locally
               and domestically focused in unions,
               day care, paid rather than volunteer
               social work, Tupperware parties—and
               the PTA, where all classes meet. In any
               case, the housewife learns to take deri-
               sion in her stride whether she intends to
               be socially effective or merely wants to
               escape from the home now and then
               (families are jealous of time spent else-
               where).
               Women’s liberation has at least be-
               gun to erode the notion that woman’s
               role is that of the applauding spectator
               for men s creativity. Yet as makers of
               (rather than housekeepers for) art, they
               still trespass on male ground. No won-
               der, then, that all over the world, wom-
               en privileged and/or desperate and/or
               daring enough to consider creation out-
               side traditional limits are finding an
               outlet for these drives in an art that is
               not considered “art, an art that there
               is some excuse for making, an art that
               costs little or nothing and performs an
               ostensibly useful function in the bar-
               gain—the art of making something out
               of nothing.
               If ones only known outlets are
               follow-the-number painting or the
               ready-made “kit art offered by the
               supermarket magazines, books like the
               Griffiths open up new territory. Sug-
               gestions in “ladies and handiwork
               magazines should not be undervalued</p>
            <p>
               either. After all, quilt patterns were
               published and passed along in the 19th
               century (just as fashionable art styles
               are in today s art world). The innova-
               tive quilt maker or group of makers
               would come up with a new idea that
               broke or enriched the rules, just as the
               Navajo rug maker might vary brilliant-
               ly within set patterns (and modern ab-
               stractionists innovate by sticking to the
               rules of innovation).
               The shared or published pattern forms
               the same kind of armature for painstak-
               ing handwork and for freedom of ex-
               pression within a framework as the
               underlying grid does in contemporary
               painting. Most modern women lack the
               skills, the motive and the discipline to

               noted in so much recent abstract art by
               women often emerges from a feminist
               adoption of the positive aspects of
               women’s history. It relates to the
               ancient, sensuously repetitive, Penelo-
               pean rhythms of seeding, hoeing, gath-
               ering, weaving, spinning, as well as to
               modern domestic routines.
               In addition, crocheting, needlework,
               embroidery, rug-hooking and quilting
               are coming back into middle- and
               upper-class fashion on the apron strings
               of feminism and fad. Ironically, these
               arts are now practiced by the well-off
               out of boredom and social presure as
               often as out of emotional necessity to
               make connections with women in the
               past. What was once work has now be-
               come art or “high craft—museum-
               worthy as well as commercially valid.
               In fact, when Navajo rugs and old
               quilts were first exhibited in New York
               fine arts museums in the early 1970s,</p>
            <p>
               they were eulogized as neutral, ungen
               dered sources for big bold geometri
               abstractions by male artists like Frank
               Stella and Kenneth Noland. Had they
               been presented as exhibitions of wom.
               en’s art, they would have been seen
               quite differently and probably would
               not have been seen at all in a fine an
               context at that time.
               When feminists pointed out tha
               these much-admired and strong
               works were in fact women’s crafts,
               one might have expected traditional
               women’s art to be taken more seriously,
               yet such borrowings from “below
               must still be validated from above.
               William C. Seitz’s Assemblage show
               at the Museum of Modern Art in 1961
               had acknowledged the generative role
               of popular objects for Cubism, Dada
               and Surrealism, and predicted Pop Art,
               but he never considered women s work
               as the classic bricolage. It took a man,
               Claes Oldenburg, to make fabric sculp-
               ture acceptable, though his wife, Patty
               did the actual sewing. Sometimes men
               even dabble in women’s spheres in the
               lowest of low arts—hobby art made
               from throwaways by amateurs at home.
               But when a man makes, say, a maca-
               roni figure or a hand-tooled Last Sup-
               per, it tends to raise the sphere rather
               than lower the man, and he is likely to
               be written up in the local newspaper.
               Women dabbling in men’s spheres, on
               the other hand, are still either inferior
               or just freakishly amazing.
               It is supposed to be men who are
               handy around the house, men who
               fix things while women make the
               home. This is a myth, of course, and a
               popular one. There are certainly as
               many women who do domestic repair.
               as men, but perhaps the myth was de-
               vised by women to force men to invest
               some energy, to touch and to care about
               some aspect of the home. The fact re-
               mains that when a woman comes to
               make something, it more often than not
               has a particular character—whether
               this originates from role-playing, the
               division of labor, or some deeper con-
               sciousness. The difference can often be
               defined as a kind of positive frag-
               mentation or as the collage aesthet-
               ic—the mixing and matching of frag-
               ments to provide a new whole. Thus the
               bootcleaner made of bottlecaps sug
               gested by one hobby book might also be
               a Surrealist object.
               But it is not. And this is not entirely a
               disadvantage. Not only does the ama-
               teur status of hobby art dispel the need
               for costly art lessons, but it subverts the
               intimidation process that takes place
               when the male domain of “high” art is
               approached. As it stands, women—and</p>

               especially women—can make hobby art
               in a relaxed manner, isolated from the
               real” world of commerce and the pres-
               sures of professional aestheticism. Dur-
               ing the actual creative process, this is
               an advantage, but when the creative
               ego s attendant need for an audience
               emerges, the next step is not the galler-
               ies, but to become a cottage indus-
               try. The gifte shoppe, the county or
               crafts fair and outdoor art show circuit
               is open to women where the high art
               world is not, or was not until it was
               pried open to some extent by the femin-
               ist art movement. For this reason,
               many professional women artists in the
               past made both public art” (canvases
               and sculptures acceptable to galleries
               and museums, conforming to a combin-
               ation of the two current art world
               tastes) and private or closet art
               (made for personal reasons or “just
               for myself”—as if most art were not).
               With the advent of the new feminism,
               the private has either replaced or
               merged with the public in much wom-
               en’s art and the delicate, the intimate,
               the obsessive, even the cute and the
               fussy in certain guises have become
               more acceptable, especially in feminist
               art circles. A striking amount of the
               newly discovered closet art by ama-
               teur and professional women artists re-
               sembles the chotchkas so universally
               scorned as women’s playthings and
               especially despised in recent decades
               during the heyday of neo-Bauhaus
               functionalism. The objects illustrated
               in Feather Flowers and Arrangements
               bear marked resemblance to what is
               now called Women’s Art, including a
               certainly unconscious bias toward the
               forms that have been called female
               imagery.
               Today we are resurrecting our moth-
               ers', aunts and grandmothers activi-
               ties—not only in the well-publicized
               areas of quilts and textiles, but also in
               the more random and freer area of
               transformational rehabilitation. On an
               emotional as well as on a practical
               level, rehabilitation has always been
               women’s work. Patching, turning col-
               lars and cuffs, remaking old clothes,
               changing buttons, refinishing or re-
               covering old furniture are all the
               traditional private resorts of the eco-
               nomically deprived woman to give her
               family public dignity. This continues
               today, even though in affluent Western
               societies cheap clothes fall apart before
               they can be rehabilitated and inventive
               patching is more acceptable (to the
               point where expensive new clothes are
               made to look rehabilitated and thrift
               shops are combed by the well-off).
               Thus “making something from noth-</p>
            <p>
               ing” is a brilliant title for a hobby book,
               appealing as it does both to housewifely
               thrift and to the American spirit of free
               enterprise—a potential means of mak-
               ing a fast buck.
               Finally, certain questions arise in re
               gard to women’s recent “traditionally
               oriented” fine art. Are the sources
               direct—from quilts and county fair
               handiwork displays—or indirect—via
               Dada, Surrealism, West Coast funk, or
               from feminist art itself? Is the resem-
               blance of women’s art-world art to hob-
               by art a result of coincidence? Of influ-
               ence, conditioning, or some inherent
               female sensibility? Or is it simply
               another instance of camp, or fashion-
               able downward mobility? The problem
               extends from source to audience.</p>

               Feminist artists have become far more
               conscious of women’s traditional arts
               than most artists, and feminist artists
               are also politically aware of the need to
               broaden their audience, or of the need
               to broaden the kind of social experience
               fine art reflects. Yet the means by which
               to fill these needs have barely been ex-
               plored. The greatest lack in the femin-
               ist art movement may be for contact
               and dialogue with those amateurs
               whose work sometimes appears to be
               imitated by the professionals. Judy
               Chicago and her co-workers on The
               Dinner Party and their collaboration
               with china painters and needleworkers,
               Miriam Schapiro’s handkerchief ex-
               changes and the credit given the women
               who embroider for her, the “Mother
               Art” group in Los Angeles which per-
               forms in laundromats and similar pub-
               lic/domestic situations, the British
               “Postal Art Event, and a few other ex-
               amples are exceptions rather than the
               rule. It seems all too likely that only in</p>
            <p>
               a feminist art world will there be a
               chance for the “fine arts, the minor
               arts, crafts, and hobby circuits to
               meet and to develop an art of making
               with a new and revitalized communica-
               tive function. It won’t happen if the
               feminist art world continues to be ab-
               sorbed by the patriarchal art world.
               And if it does happen, the next ques-
               tion will be to what extent can this work
               be reconciled with all the varying cri-
               teria that determine aesthetic quality
               in the different spheres, groups, and
               cultures? Visual consciousness raising,
               concerned as it is now with female im-
               agery and, increasingly, with female
               process, still has a long way to go before
               our visions are sufficiently cleared to
               see all the arts of making as equal pro-
               ducts of a creative impulse which is as
               socially determined as it is personally
               necessary; before the idea is no longer
               to make nothings into somethings, but
               to transform and give meaning to all
               things. In this utopian realm, Good
               Taste will not be standardized in
               museums, but will vary from place to
               place, from home to home.</p>

               /irginia Woolf talks about the loose, drifting material of life, describing how she would like to see it sorted
               and coalesced into a mold transparent enough to reflect the light of our life and yet aloof as a work of art.
               She makes us think of the paper lace, quills and beads, scraps of cloth, photographs, birthday cards, valen
               tines and clippings, all of which inspired the visual imaginations of the women we write about.
               In the eighteenth century, a nun in a German convent cuts delicate lace from thin parchment and pastes i
               around minutely detailed paintings of saints. Performing an act of devotion in the service of her God, she makes
               what later, in the secular world, are called the first valentines.
               An Iroquois woman in 1775 sews five elliptical quillwork designs at the base of a black buckskin bag, quillwork
               borders at the top and additional moosehair embroidery at the bottom and sides.
               Hannah Stockton, a New Jersey woman, in 1830 dips into her scrap bag in the tradition of waste not want not and
               finds just the right pieces with which to appliqué her quilt.
               In thé 1860s, Lady Filmer photographs the Prince of Wales and his shooting party. Later she cuts up these photos
               and creates a composition of them in her album, producing the first photocollage.
               Rita Reynolds, resident of Southend, England, keeps a scrapbook during World War II. In it she glues birthda
               cards, valentines and clippings from her local newspaper which record the progress of the war. As the world situ-
               ation worsens, the scrapbook reflects its gravity.</p>

               Collage: a word invented in the twentieth century to describe an activity with an ancient history. Here are some
               associated definitions:
               Collage: pictures assembled from assorted materials.
               Collage: a French word after the verb coller which means pasting, sticking or gluing, as in application of wallpaper.
               Assemblage: a collection of things, often combined in the round.
               Assemblage: a specific technical procedure and form used in the literary and musical, as well as the plastic arts, but
               also a complex of attitudes and ideas . . . collage and related modes of construction manifest a predisposition that is
               characteristically modern.
               Découpage: (literally, cutting) a mode of decorating painted furniture with cutouts of flowers, fruit, etc. Also, the ar
               of decorating surfaces with applied paper cutouts.
               Photomontage: the method of making a composite picture by bringing photographs together in a single composition
               and arranging them, often by superimposing one part on another, so that they form a blended whole.</p>

               SCRAPBOOK
               This store-bought scrapbook (circa 1940s) was found in a Lon-
               don Flea Market. On first impression it seems banal, yet there
               is novelty in its contents: newspaper clippings, decals, some
               birthday and holiday cards with portions silhouetted (some are
               left whole) and commercially colored animal pictures.</p>
            <p>
               Rita Reynolds, in selecting her pictures, showed what wa
               important to her, revealing her personal priorities. The seem-
               ingly unrelated information adds up to pre-war and wartime
               episodes that make “that loose drifting material of life” in fac
               coalesce into a work of art.1° This, then, is a visual artist
               equivalent of a diary.</p>

               Femmage: a word invented by us to include all of the above activities as they were practiced by women using tradi-
               tional women’s techniques to achieve their art—sewing, piecing, hooking, cutting, appliquéing, cooking and the like
               -activities also engaged in by men but assigned in history to women.</p>
            <p>
               Published information about the origins of collage is misleading. Picasso and Braque are credited with inventing
               it. Many artists made collage before they did, Picasso’s father for one and Sonia Delaunay for another. When art his
               torians mandate these beginnings at 1912, they exclude artists not in the mainstream. Art historians do not pay atten
               tion to the discoveries of non-Western artists, women artists or anonymous folk artists. All of these people make up
               the group we call others. It is exasperating to realize that the rigidities of modern critical language and thought pre
               vent a direct response to the eloquence of art when it is made by others.
               Our information on women artist-makers of the past was inspired by the definitive texts on collage written by
               critics and art historians Herta Wescher, William Seitz, Harriet Janis and Rudi Blesh. We did not find our material
               in the main body of their works but rather in their introductions and in their notes in the back of their books, in-
               dicating they were unable to relax their modernist theories enough to appreciate the diversity, beauty and signifi-
               cance of the original makers of collage. Many of these ancestors were women who were ignored by the politics of art
               Janis and Blesh put it succinctly: “Collage was once only the simple pleasant fold art or pastime of cutting and
               pasting bits of paper into pictures or ornamental designs. It was no concern of serious artists. . . . Its origins began so
               many centuries ago. . . . It is only with this century and the advent of modern art that this quondum delight of
               schoolgirl and housewife came to the attention of serious artists grappling with revolutionary ideas . . .”4 It is in fact
               the “schoolgirl” and “housewife” we must look at more carefully to understand the aesthetics of our ancestors and
               their processes.
               William Seitz includes this information in his work on assemblage: “Valentines, postcards, and folk art of various
               kinds incorporating pasted elements as well as pictures and objects made of butterfly wings, feathers, shells, etc.
               were common much earlier. Indeed various stamped letters, passports and official documents can be looked at as a
               form of unintentional collage."
               Now that we women are beginning to document our culture, redressing our trivialization and adding our informa-
               tion to the recorded male facts and insights, it is necessary to point out the extraordinary works of art by women
               which despite their beauty are seen as leftovers of history. Aesthetic and technical contributions have simply been
               overlooked. Here, for example, we are concerned with the authenticity and energy in needlework.

               LAND AND SEA
               This unusual quilt does not adhere to any formula for quilt-
               making. It has no set pattern—block, brick, half drop or dia-
               mond form; there are no predictable geometric or imagistic
               formulas here. It appears to be a crazy quilt with a theme.
               Crazy quilts are made of freely cut pieces of cloth which may
               seem to be randomly placed. Here the theme is carried out in
               motifs of land and sea cut from imported English chintz of
               Oriental design (the technique called broderie perse).
               Holstein says, “. . . so popular was this technique that in the
               early nineteenth century, chintzes were printed with patterns
               especially designed to be cut out and used for the centers and
               corners of applique quilts.
               A 103 inch by 91 inch quilt is a large work. Visual control is as
               impressive in this work as it is on the small devotional pieces.</p>

               FEMMAGE
               When it becomes possible to appreciate a sewn object like a quilt (even though it was created for utilitarian pur
               poses) because it employs thirty stitches to the inch, and uses color which by all standards is rich and evocative, con
               tains silhouetted forms which are skillfully drawn and connects perfectly measured geometrical units of fabric, then
               it will be clear that woman’s art invites a methodology of its own.
               Women have always collected things and saved and recycled them because leftovers yielded nourishment in new
               forms. The decorative functional objects women made often spoke in a secret language, bore a covert imagery. When
               we read these images in needlework, in paintings, in quilts, rugs and scrapbooks, we sometimes find a cry for help.
               sometimes an allusion to a secret political alignment, sometimes a moving symbol about the relationships betweer
               men and women. We base our interpretations of the layered meanings in these works on what we know of our own
               lives—a sort of archeological reconstruction and deciphering. We ask ourselves, have we ever used a secret language
               in our works? Patricia Mainardi, in her essay, says: “Women not only made beautiful and functional objects but ex
               pressed their own conviction on a wide variety of subjects in a language for the most part comprehensible only te
               other women . . . There was more than one man of Tory persuasion who slept unknowingly under his wife’s “
               Rose Quilt” . . . women named quilts for their political belief . . . at a time when they were not allowed to vote.
               Collected, saved and combined materials represented for such women acts of pride, desperation and necessity
               Spiritual survival depended on the harboring of memories. Each cherished scrap of percale, muslin or chintz, each
               bead, each letter, each photograph, was a reminder of its place in a woman’s life, similar to an entry in a journal or
               diary. Cynthia Ozick says, . .. a diary is a shoring-up of the ephemeral, evidence that the writer (we substitute
               artist-maker takes up real space in the world.
               Women’s culture is the framework for femmage, and makes it possible for us to understand “combining” as th
               simultaneous reading of moosehair and beads, cut paper and paint or open-work and stitches. Our female culture
               also makes it possible to see these traditional aesthetic elements for what they are—the natural materials needed for
               spiritual, and often physical, survival.
               In the past an important characteristic of femmage was that women worked for an audience of intimates. A
               woman artist-maker always had the assurance that her work was destined to be appreciated and admired. She
               worked for her relatives and friends and unless she exhibited in church bazaars and county fairs, her viewers were
               almost always people she knew. In their book, Joel and Kate Kopp tell about Mrs. Eleanor Blackstone of Lacon, Il
               linois, who in the years between 1880 and 1890 hooked six large rugs, all recording events in the history of her family
               These rugs show her six children, their pastimes and their pets including actual strands of the children’s hair worked
               into the individual portraits.</p>
            <p>
               S. JOANNES EV.
               Works like this paper femmage were
               made to be carried in a prayer book
               This devotional work, approximately
               five inches by two inches, was an hom-
               age to a saint that the artist-maker, a
               nun, wished to honor. In this case St.
               John the Evangelist sits in his oval sur-
               rounded by ornate cut paper simulating
               lace. The whiteness of the lace is offset</p>
            <p>
               by an illusionistic rendering of the saint
               himself. The cutting exhibits an aston-
               ishing capability in the use of knives
               and scissors as tools. The paper lace is
               pasted around the painting of the saint
               and part of it is painted as well.
               The appeal of these works is their deli
               cacy and the tour de force of the cut
               ting. The artist’s process echoes her
               purpose. The love lavished by this nun
               on the little object is visible.</p>

               FEMMAGE</p>
            <p>
               We feel that several criteria determine whether a work can be called femmage. Not all of them appear in a single
               object. However, the presence of at least half of them should allow the work to be appreciated as femmage.
               1. It is a work by a woman. 2. The activities of saving and collecting are important ingredients. 3. Scraps are essen-
               tial to the process and are recycled in the work. 4. The theme has a woman-life context. 5. The work has elements of
               covert imagery. 6. The theme of the work addresses itself to an audience of intimates. 7. It celebrates a private or
               public event. 8. A diarist's point of view is reflected in the work. 9. There is drawing and/or handwriting sewn in the
               work. 10. It contains silhouetted images which are fixed on other material. II. Recognizable images appear in nar
               rative sequence. 12. Abstract forms create a pattern. 13. The work contains photographs or other printed matter
               14. The work has a functional as well as an aesthetic life.</p>
            <p>
               These criteria are based on visual observation of many works made by women in the past. We have already said
               that this art has been excluded from mainstream, but why is that so? What is mainstream? How may such an omis
               sion be corrected?
               The works themselves were without status because the artists who made them were considered inferior by the his
               torians who wrote about art and culture. Since the works were intimate and had no data or criticism attached to them
               and were often anonymous, how could these writers identify them as valid, mainstream history!
               Mainstream is the codification of ideas for the illumination of history and the teaching of the young. What a shame
               that the young remain ignorant of the vitality of women’s art. Yet the culture of women will remain unrecognized un-
               til women themselves regard their own past with fresh insight. To correct this situation, must we try to insert
               women’s traditional art into mainstream? How will the authorities be convinced that what they consider low art is
               worth representing in history? The answer does not lie in mainstream at all, but in sharing women’s information with
               women.
               Toward this end we have evaluated a selection of women’s art and looked for similar elements which appeared
               most frequently. As we recorded them, we discovered with pleasure that they presented a form in many guises—a
               form we call femmage.

               PRINCE OF WALES
               SHOOTING PARTY
               Lady Mary Filmer was an early practi-
               tioner of photography, a contemporary
               of the more celebrated Julia Margaret
               Cameron. But Lady Filmer took pho-
               tography to another place. She cut,
               rearranged and pasted her pictures on
               to album pages, sometimes adding
               watercolor. Her work pre-dated the
               papier collé of Picasso and Braque and
               the photomontages of Hannah Hoch
               and Raoul Hausmann. In Lady Mary’s
               circle, most women did fancywork.</p>
            <p>
               Today this term
               is used disparag-
               ingly by cultural
               historians whose
               aesthetic remains uninformed by wom-
               en’s culture. In their hierarchical symp-
               athies, they elevate the camera above
               the crochet needle. Although we believe
               Lady Filmer’s photocollages were ad-
               mirable achievements, the other wom
               en of her time were accomplishing
               equally interesting work.

            <p>
               Suzanne Noguere</p>
            <p>
               Today you bend over organdy
               In organic toil, working the small red squares
               The way in your youth old men bent over earth
               And still coaxed wheat and corn from the Basque soil.
               You fold the cloth, then slowly roll the edges
               Until rose petals bloom in your hands,
               Vivified by the stitch that shirs them softly
               The way the skin is shirred around your eyes.
               Crooked like a mitered edge, your index finger
               At rest stays poised above an unseen needle.
               Indoors, surrounded by left-over silk
               And wool, we rearrange the rainbow’s spectrum,
               Sorting the tools of your trade—bright spools of thread,
               Small silver thimbles, scissors, and the red
               Pincushions studded with glass-headed pins-
               As we need them, laboring in your field.
               We overlap the petals; roses thrive
               Under the lamplight in your wintry room.
               Next you teach me the genesis of frogs:
               We turn the tubing and vivid cloth emerges
               Out of itself like a snake sloughing its skin;
               You whorl it tightly and I think this is
               How your great spirit must exist in you
               Compactly, coiled like a spring.
               From what misfortune could you not recover
               Who as a child made the pilgrimage
               To Lourdes, eastward through the low green mountains
               Of your own land? You say the Virgin slept
               And say it lightly as if you had not been
               Bitterly born to your mother’s shame
               In an age when no one could tell you of
               The tiny gland that kept you tiny.
               Self-taught and independent by your own
               Inventions, you make buttons out of thread,
               Handbags with pockets hidden within pockets,
               And dresses that unfold as if corollas
               With minute parts inside. You instruct me in
               Techniques as secret as nature’s, my fingers
               Sure when yours are, atremble when yours falter
               Those sharp days when you feel more and more mortal.</p>

               The earliest aprons wove a
               shield of magical strength about
               the women who wore them, sym
               bolizing fertility. A Great Moth
               er figurine, the “Venus of Les
               pugne,” 14,000 B.C., wears an
               apron beneath her voluptuous
               buttocks. She is carved of ivory
               though the apron proclaiming
               her fecundity was probably wo-
               ven of pierced cowrie shells.
               Among Celts and other early
               English and European tribes
               aprons vied with body paint as
               ceremonial costume and decora
               tion. On every continent triba
               women wove aprons of feathers,
               bark and leaves, and patternec
               them with natural dyes. Aborig-
               ine virgins in Australia still wea
               aprons of leaves.? The fig lea
               worn by the mythological Eve
               was probably a fertility apron
               rather than a modesty panel.
               Missionaries, acting upon the
               body-is-bad principle, replaced
               these natural materials with
               cheap cotton pinafores, called in
               Polynesia the Pina Foa, and sub-
               stituted Victorian needlework foi
               traditional “pagan” designs.
               European peasant women cre-
               ated brilliantly colored and em-
               broidered aprons. In Italy long
               strips of plaid wool or silk edged
               with embroidered borders were
               worked in stitchery and worn
               wrapped around the waist, over-
               lapping in front. The Koteny
               made by Hungarian women was
               highly prized and passed down ir
               the family. The Indianapolis</p>

               Status Symbol...
               Children’s Museum owns a Hun-
               garian apron exuberantly worked
               with billowing scarlet and red
               violet poppies and finished with
               hand-knotted fringe on an em
               broidered blue and green ground.
               In Rumania style called for nar
               row rectangles of gold, black and
               red horizontal stripes, worn back
               and front. A Czech apron in
               rainbow silks displays the jac-
               quard brocade weaving tech
               nique. Swedish and Swiss aprons
               were gaily striped, identifying
               the parish of the wearer
               A gypsy woman can ostracize
               a male member of the tribe by
               touching or covering him with
               her apron or katrinsa which sym
               bolizes to the tribe the marime or
               unclean status of the lower half
               of a woman’s body. In the
               American folk song “Careles
               Love” the apron is a baromete
               of virginity lost and the woman’
               loss of esteem among males seek
               ing wives.
               Once 1 wore my apron low . .
               and you came by my door . .
               Now I wear my apron high. .
               and you come to my door and
               pass on by . ..
               In Elizabethan England aprons
               came into fashion. Wealthy, ti-
               tled women created a frivolous
               parody of the working apron,
               stitched in white lawn and ex
               pensive Franch lace. During the
               reign of Queen Anne, wedding
               gowns were not complete without
               a lace-point apron secured with a
               jeweled pin.</p>

               or Stitchery Sample?
               In Victorian England the wife
               and mother role became separ-
               ated from household chores for
               affluent women. A checked ging
               ham apron was worn by the
               cook. Kitchen servants and par
               lormaids wore floor-length white
               aprons with huge skirts and bibs
               Ladies sat at their needlework
               with dainty aprons, announcing
               their privileged class by the
               apron’s impracticality.
               Personal decoration was dis-
               couraged as vanity by early
               American settlers. Pilgrim wom
               en wore snowy-white, full-length
               aprons set against plain green
               brown and dull purple homespur
               skirts.° Pioneer women’s apron
               were tucked many times dowr
               the front. This enabled the hems,
               which burnt as they swept the
               hearth, to be turned up again
               and again.” Aprons of a century
               ago still carry stains that bear
               witness to the enduring nature of
               woman’s work. Middle-class
               American women in the early
               nineteenth century wore aprons
               with their fine Sunday gowns.
               Those over 30 and/or married
               were expected to wear black or
               white, and as a woman grew old-
               er, black was her only option
               Silk or satin or other fine ma-
               terials such as dimity and chiffon
               could be used to make Sunday
               aprons and hand-decorating
               demonstrated a woman’s wifely
               skills."

               Although contemporary women
               have neither the practical nor the
               institutionalized need for apron-
               wearing, by rediscovering the

               One function of the artist in modern Western culture
               has been to seek out the despised, rejected or totally
               overlooked visual objects in her environment and dis-
               cover and reevaluate her aesthetics.
               In an issue devoted to Women’s Traditional Arts,
               it seemed essential to me to seriously reexamine those
               women who never stopped creating, though their
               work is often bypassed by liberated women artists
               who have turned away from the trappings of their fe-
               male environment and past.
               The following letter was sent to many women all</p>
            <p>
               over the United States. Here are some of the replies.
               Dear
               The fourth issue of Heresies Magazine is entirely devoted
               to womens traditional arts.
               we know you are a highly skilled craftswoman.
               we would be very pleased if you would allow a taped
               interviey to be made where you could talk about your craft,
               How you learned it, who you learned it from, to whom you
               have taught it, and how , and what it means to you, are
               some of the questions we are interested in.
               We hope you will demonstrate your craft and allow it to
               be documented by a photographer.

               These raspberry leaves are very, very good . . . if you are going to
               have a child it’s best to start drinking raspberry tea three months
               before you give birth and 1 was brought up that a gypsy woman
               could have her child, wash it in a mud puddle and walk off, and one
               of the reasons was they drank raspberry tea and had a very easy
               labor. The Indian women did the same.
               I grew up in Vermont, just across the river. My grandfather came
               down from Canada; he was Indian so we used a lot of these things
               (medicinal and wild edible plants) at home always. My mother used
               some of these things in cooking, during the depression years. My
               father didn’t have work then so we used a lot of these things; some
               of them, for my mother, the first time. My mother’s ancestry was
               English and she just had never had much chance to learn these</p>
            <p>
               things. I learned it mainly from dad and his sister.
               I always had a great interest in flowers and what was this and
               what was that, and 1 can’t remember when I didn’t have a guide of
               some kind. 1 was encouraged to look things up by myself as well as
               being told what they were. When I was 11 I went and lived with my
               grandfather’s half-sister and her husband and they tried to take the
               Indian out of me, but they couldn’t do it. They really encouraged
               me to learn the names of plants. But they used to scold because 1
               had a bunch of flowers in one hand and a rock in the other most of
               the time and they were trying to civilize me. But they didn’t. I often
               wonder now what they really would think to know that l’m teaching
               the things that they tried to break me of the habits of using. In fact
               they knew 1 wanted to teach when 1 got out of high school, but they
               didn’t believe in borrowing money so you could go on to school. So l
               got married and started my own kindergarten—we had six kids that
               lived, we had ten children. My husband wanted 12; I would have
               stopped at two. After my second child was born, a breech birth, the
               doctor said, “You’d better not have any more children for a while,
               I told my husband. He said, “Huh, my mother had 13, you can
               have more than two;” so 1 had ten. A lot of people say how did you
               raise such healthy children? When we were on the farm we never
               had more than 85,000 a year for years, most of their growing-up
               years. Five or six, seven thousand at the most would take care of the
               cattle and the family. I tell them, I brought them up on dandelions
               and venison, what do you think?
               l’ve taught some of my children about plants. l’ve got daughters-
               in-law that listen, but don’t quite believe. My husband used to say.
               “I wouldn’t eat that, it might be poisonous.” I’d say, “What did
               “I don’t know, somethin’, whatevei
               you eat for supper tonight?
               you put on the table.” I’d say, “Well, you just ate it; have you
               died?” He’s beginning now not to talk that way. It was a long time
               now, but for years he’d been eating these things and I just didn’t
               talk about what I put on the table. Then I began teaching a college
               course, and he began saying, “Oh, I didn’t know about that.” I was
               ever so happy when college came nearby and 1 could go to school;
               l’d always wanted to. 1 got my diploma when I was 49. 1 was de-
               termined I was going to get it before I was 50. I made it.
               1 do all the canning by myself now. I taught my daughters to can.
               Yes, it is a lot of work, but l’ve done it so many years that 1
               wouldn’t know what it’d be like to have a summer vacation and do
               nothing. I would feel all the time that I should be putting away
               things for the winter. During the time I had polio I never knew that
               it had been discussed, but I just was told in my hospital bed that
               welfare was going to give money to help feed my children. They evi-
               dently had not asked because I had 500 quarts of canned goods for
               my family to use.
               Until recently I thought everybody knew something about some
               of these wild plants. l’ve always lived in the country and people
               around me always were using things like dandelions, marsh mari-
               golds and milkweed. There’s so many things, and just never time
               enough, nor hands enough in my life. This summer l’ve had the best
               time because I did have someone who could drive, who was willing
               to take me wherever 1 wanted to go. There’s so much still undone.</p>

               DORASCHOCHEI</p>
            <p>
               I was born in Bialystok. That was Russia then, now it’s Poland.
               I’m 47 years here, and I came here I was 26, 27. I came on Thanks-
               giving day; the boat came here on Kosciusko. It docked, I went
               right to the turkey. It was already different times when 1 came here.
               Times weren’t good. My two girls were born. 1 had a lot of time in
               Europe. I never worked in my life. 1 was not a millionaire’s daugh-
               ter, but a comfortable parents’ daughter. This work was having
               friends, going out. In Europe a girl is not working. Only boys, and
               boys are in the business or going to school. When 1 started to go to
               school, first I learned Yiddish, then I went to public school; it was
               Russian. When the Germans came in, I learned German. Then the
               Polish came in; you changed for Polish. And then I was married. I
               came to this country; 1 went a little school here, and that’s it. Now
               it’s a dream, what it was. We were girls thinking of good times.
               My mother always wanted 1 should go to school and learn how to
               sew, but I never went. I learned it all myself. When I became of
               age, 10 or 12, she bought a machine and said, “You must sew on a
               machine, because I could never do it.” We used to wash the whole
               week. Before washing, you had to fix things, darn things, iron
               things, but my mother, she didn’t know how. So my mother always
               thought 1 should know a little. She always wanted me to go to a
               dressmaker and she will pay to teach me, but 1 never wanted. I did
               things that I like to do myself. Maybe I was 12 or 13, I started. I
               was making my embroidery for myself, for my children. My mother
               told me it was to prepare for marriage. You always prepare. That’s
               why I thought to make so many things. I thought for children, and I
               didn’t think of selling it. Oh no, I would never let Babe sell them.
               Not selling. She can give to her daughter
               The colors I always did on my own. 1 chose the pictures to my
               taste. Things that I felt, flowers, faces, lots of curls. You like green,
               Ilike blue. I didn’t make the designs. I used to buy them, like a pat
               tern, and we used to trace them. This was so beautiful when it was
               done, like a picture of angels. After all, angels should be naked, but
               how could you have a picture with naked angels. Here was white,
               here was pinkish satin; this was white wool, like a bear on a floor.
               Satin like a curtain. This was apple green silk; real silk, beautiful
               silk. It’s not such a nice face one of them, because angels should
               really have nicer faces than that, but that was the pattern, and 1
               couldn’t do any other way, because 1 wasn’t to change the painting.
               You see, I criticize my own work. Change it? I could not do it. I
               only could embroider. This has to be done this way, according to the
               design: some smaller stitches, some longer. Some day 1l’Il wash it,
               like in Woolite; I’Il iron it, and I’Il frame it in nonglare glass.
               When I came to this country you know I had a lot of stuff. We
               didn’t have television, only a gramophone, then later on, we had</p>

               maybe a radio. In my house my girlfriends and 1 used to get to-
               gether. So we did work; all day long the young women, the elderly
               women . . . We came here; a friend of mine gave me a lot of stuff to
               sell for money; but nobody wanted to look at it. So 1 packed it and
               sent it back. I kept mine, put it away, packed and unpacked, put it
               away, air it out, put it away again, air it out and put it away again. I
               made everything to be used. Definite, I thought. When I was here
               and nobody wanted to look at it, 1 was very much disappointed. I
               worked so hard. That’s why I stopped to do it here. Look, I could
               not even give for a gift what I made. They made fun of it. Sure 1
               thought it was art. I thought it something worthwhile to do it. In
               Europe handwork was very much important.
               I’m married 55 years, so I could write a book with a lot of trouble.
               When I started embroidering I didn’t have any trouble. I did it for
               pleasure. I didn’t think of it as a career. Maybe if I was to live now, if
               I would be as young as you, I wouldn’t want to be a housewife, be-
               cause, let’s face the facts, it’s a waste of time. It’s not appreciated, if
               you like. Keep on being what you want to be, be successful. I ad-
               mire women that’s going to work now. I say, it’s really lovely that
               my daughter Evelyn goes to work. She’s a person, she s somebody.</p>

               What I do is embroider. This is the kind of embroidery I do at
               work—it’s called cross-stitch. It’s a sample for a blouse to see if the
               color is all right. Here in New York is where most of this kind of em-
               broidery is done. l’m the “sample-maker. Let’s suppose that
               you’re a customer, you come to see it, you like it and you order three
               or four thousand dozen to be made for you. Then that order goes to
               the embroidery machines and while I can embroider one piece.
               those machines can produce 250 pieces. There are a few women who
               are watchers, who for example put the cloth on the frames and take
               care of the machines, but they’re almost always men. Five or six
               girls work on each frame; there are helpers there also to change the
               thread, to mark where the embroidery goes. No one actually draws.
               The machine works on a key punch. It’s beautiful, the embroidery
               problem. I love it; it’s beautiful.
               The “sample-makers” are always women. My work is always
               done by machine, but there are companies that do hand embroidery
               —like the sweaters that are embroidered by hand. The company I
               work for has 14 women who work in their houses because they have
               children. In one hour, I can do both flowers. You have to keep
               counting the stitches continually or else you’re lost, the flower loses
               its shape completely. You have to have a lot of patience. When you
               do the first one it always takes longer, but l’ve had so much prac-</p>
            <p>
               tice; by the time you do the second or third it’s much easier.
               I taught myself how to embroider in Cuba. In my house, as in
               practically every other house in tropical countries, there was a sew-
               ing machine, a Singer. But, as a young girl I liked to embroider so
               much that I embroidered sheets. Before I got married I made my
               whole trousseau. Completely. 1 used to get my designs from people
               who 1 saw embroider, and used to see the designs in magazines. I
               have a dress I made when I was 17 years old; I made the whole yoke
               by hand. I saw the style somewhere, then 1 planned out the pattern
               myself. My mother, she didn’t embroider but she sewed. Look, my
               two sisters work as duplicate makers in dress factories and they do
               well. They went to school in Cuba for two years and got their
               degrees in sewing.
               In Cuba there was no remedy, if you were from the poor classes,
               but to learn to sew or embroider. I lived in a rural town in the Las
               Villas province. The first job I had when I came to this country was
               making wedding veils. For one year I sewed on the crowns by hand.
               After that job I did part-time embroidery because I wasn’t practiced
               enough on the electric machines. In Cuba you have to use a foot
               pedal. Then I stopped doing the embroidery that I had done for
               myself because they paid me more for doing something that I liked.
               When you go out for work you have to be practical and leave</p>

               behind. . . . 1 don’t have a chance any more to do work for my
               house. Just think, I work at the company for seven hours. Those
               who embroider get left without their sight. You can’t do this work
               for many years without losing your sight. Everyday that passes l’m
               left with less sight. After I come home I work for another four
               hours. I start at about 6:30 and it’s 10:30 and l’m still sitting at that
               machine. Tired. Dead, dead, dead, tired, tired. But I need it. I’m
               paying for my daughter’s college. On Saturdays I work at home till
               about three or four. And if I don’t finish then I finish Sunday morn-

               Mrs. Dora Bund, 86 years old, is my aunt’s mother. Earlier this
               year, I visited her in the hospital where 1 conducted this interview.
               She has a heart condition. Also present were Mrs. Bund’s daughter,
               Beatrice Butter (Beaty), her daughter-in-law, Marcia Bund, and
               my mother, Selma Butter.
               HANNAH: I saw the blanket you made for my mother. How do
               you make them and why
               DORA: You want in Yiddish or in English ..
               HANNAH: Ich can nich sprechen Yiddish. English, please.
               DORA: I make them. It’s my work . . . I have to do something
               HANNAH: You never made the blankets until about six years
               DORA: No. It cost too much money. Then my grandson-in-law
               gave me the wool. For the great-grandchildren 1 got blankets. Every
               birthday I make blankets. Before I must make money. I sew
               dresses. Then I stopped sewing, start this
               HANNAH: So, when you were 80, you stopped working and
               started to make the blankets.
               DORA: Even in the nighttime, l’m sick and I can’t sleep. I take
               my work and sit in the bed, till l’m tired. I make the rule, I knit.
               When I was ten years old I start to sew. Europe is not like over here.
               Was in school three hours a day, and I only worked to do
               something. One day my mother looked for me in the whole park.
               She can’t find me. I was with the dressmaker. When it was night-
               time 1 came home. Everybody asked me where 1 was. And I say, 1
               want to sew. 1 don’t want to go to school. So my mother went to this
               dressmaker and say, all right, she learn to sew, only she must go two
               hours to school. My mother paid this lady three dollars for two years
               to teach me to sew. When the two years finish, I say, this is the last
               day 1 be over here. The dressmaker tell me, you owe me ten days
               because you were in shul one day, you were sick one day . . . After
               that 1 got a different dressmaker. She gave me 815 for two years.
               Thirty cents a week. I was 14, 15 years old. Must be there all day.
               Come eight o’clock till eight o’clock. Was a strike. Must be union.
               And the strike was finished, we worked from eight to five, from nine
               to six. One dressmaker take me for a dollar a week. I was 16. I work
               for this woman not too long. My family had a big house then. One
               dressmaker came by and said to my father and mother, she pay 815
               a year rent to put her machine in their window. She said, maybe you
               would buy a machine and I be partners with you. My father go right
               away and bought me a new machine for 850. And I stop that othei
               work. 1 was very small. When the people come and I take measure,
               1 can’t reach them. My father was a carpenter. He make me a bench
               to step up. When I married I got three machines. Four girls work
               for me.
               SELMA: I remember you saying you buried your children in a
               trench during the First World War.
               DORA: My husband was in war. In Poland. After the Germans
               come in my country. Thirty-six people there was in a trench. Others
               covered us up. It was a day and a night. In the morning about six
               o clock the people came and say, come in, the Germans is here! We
               was three years with the Germans. When my husband came from
               the war it was four years already.
               HANNAH: And you were still a dressmaker?</p>
            <p>
               My Father’s Brother’s Wife’s Mother by Hannah Wilke</p>
            <p>
               DORA: What kind of dressmaker? Nobody got even to eat. I give
               up a machine for the bread.
               HANNAH: When did you come here?
               DORA: 1922.
               HANNAH: Did you open the store immediately?
               DORA: No. Right away I bought a machine. In the house.
               Because I got two small children.
               HANNAH: Your husband was with you too?
               DORA: We come together. My husband come in America when
               he was 16 years old. Till 20. He had to leave America to go back to
               be a soldier. Then we married. Six months after we married, broke
               out the war and he had to go back. Only my husband became a sick
               man from the war. He was all life sick. Over here you come soldier
               from the war, is sick, is got benefits. In my country nobody can get
               nothing.
               HANNAH: At 60 you opened up the business because your hus-
               band couldn’t work any more
               DORA: My husband was 15 years in the house. I come to the
               store and I sewing dolls. I sew kitchen curtains. All day I was in the
               store, and at nighttime. People still now got curtains. Never 1 use a
               pattern. Now I can’t even take the needle in the finger.
               HANNAH: Now you have arthritis, but you can knit?
               DORA: To knit I can put the needle in there. But even sewing a
               button I get stuck in the finger.
               HANNAH: Which do you like better?
               DORA: I like to be finished already. What can I like now, tell
               me? Where is going I must go. I got a grandfather. He say, when
               time is come, he get a summons, he go to court. When is come for
               me, must go to court. When my grandfather lived, he say will come
               a time when will be no walking. People will be flying. And when my
               papa and grandfather lived was not even taxes and bills.
               BEATY: No taxis and automobiles.
               DORA: I was 15, 16 years old when my grandfather died. We
               lived together. My grandfather tells my grandmother to go buy a
               kerchief. I make the hems and he gives me two cents. You be good,
               this window be for your machine. When he is die, I push right away
               the machine in this window.
               HANNAH: So if you put the machine in the window you were a
               seamstress. It would be like a sign on the door. And when your
               grandfather died, you knew it was the time.
               DORA: My grandfather was a baker. He baked bread. My
               grandfather was rich. My grandfather maybe got 12 children. Al-
               ways die. Small babies, babies, babies die. Only one children. One
               dog. Before when I was occupied I forgot. Now is come back.
               BEATY: She is the only one left.
               DORA: Nobody. Only my aunt, was my father’s sister, was come
               over here.
               BEATY: At home she (Dora) did a little dressmaking. Like when
               I was a teenager. We would take a walk on Clinton Street and I
               would tell her 1 like the neck of this and this sleeves of this, and she
               would make it. She used to holler at me because I cried if it didn’t
               look so good, while she was working. And she would say, to a fool
               you don’t show half labor. I always had original dresses. She never
               worked with a pattern. She should have been a designer in a big
               place with ideas.
               HANNAH: Do you call them blankets or art works?
               DORA: I say this is a blanket I make.
               HANNAH: And you made that up yourself, the idea of stripes and
               squares
               DORA: Yeh. Yeh. With stripes, each is a different color, different
               shape, different size. I sew together and put border around. Make
               squares is two times as hard as other. Each strip got maybe ten
               squares, eight inches by eight inches. Each square different design.
               Make strip 80 inches, then more strips and sew together.
               HANNAH: How long do you take?
               DORA: I make this in four, five weeks.
               You like to make objects that are useful?
               HANNAH:
               DORA: I don’t know. I make. I say, you like it, take it
               Did you keep any for yourself!
               HANNAH:
               DORA: I got for myself two. I make over a hundred.
               A toaster cover she made, a hassock cover . ..

               DORA: A couch I covered.
               HANNAH: So you are covering all the ugly stuff.
               DORA: I never want to be rich. Was satisfied with what I got
               Because when I married I was rich. Paper money is no good money.
               Still have money from Poland. Got a big house. Lose house because
               the money worth nothing. When the soldiers came they take away
               everything. Even Beaty was a baby, got shoes, take away shoes. I</p>
            <p>
               got when I was married two dozen shirts. Everything embroidered.
               The soldiers took away. This night they kill four people, because the
               people don’t give them. 1 say, take. Is come, the knives was like
               this. You scream, you see, you must be shot.
               HANNAH: So you were lucky you had something to give them,
               DORA: Take away everything. Wasn’t rich wasn’t nothing.
               HANNAH: Real barter has nothing to do with money. It has to do
               with survival. We all have our own ways to survive.</p>

               Sarah Mandell and Enid Aljoe
               with collaborative piece</p>
            <p>
               Sarah Mandell, grandmother of Dee Shapiro, is 84 years old,
               Jewish, born in Russia. For the past 13 years she has been living
               with her daughter. Enid Aljoe is 55 years old, born in Jamaica,
               West Indies. She has been the housekeeper in Dee’s mother’s house
               hold for 23 years.
               DEE: Where did you learn to sew, Grandma?
               SARAH: In Europe they had no school. They just had someone to
               teach the children how to work so they could work for nothing. If a
               woman had a house and was getting work from the neighbors, shirts
               or blouses, so she took a couple of young girls and taught them how
               to sew—meanwhile, they were sewing for her the things, and when
               they knew enough most of them went to America and went into the
               factories and worked on shirts and blouses. That was all they knew,
               and those who didn’t know went into domestic work. I was 12 years
               old in London, I went to school but one of my mother’s friends
               showed me how to sew buttons on. When 1 came here 1 went to the
               factory and sewed buttons.
               DEE: How many years did you work there?
               SARAH: Not long, I got married. After 25 years I went back to
               work again in the same factory. I was what you call a finisher, sew-
               ing buttons, making buttonholes, all handwork. It was the men
               working the pressing machines, sewing machines and cutting ma
               chines. After the World War, the women came in and were sewing
               by machine.
               JUDY: Did the men get higher pay?
               SARAH: Yes, but it was what you call slave labor
               DEE: Could you work your way up in the factory?
               SARAH: No. I didn’t want to go back to work as a finisher
               because the operators were getting a union, but they wouldn’t give
               me a chance to go to the machine, and 1 knew how to sew.
               DEE: Why not?
               SARAH: Because I would have to get more money and the boss
               would say, “Oh, I need you, Sarah, for this kind of work and you
               can’t be bothered going to the machine and work,” because he knew
               1 would get more money.
               JUDY: Did you do any other kind of handwork?
               SARAH: I took home lamp shades, that was when I was married</p>
            <p>
               and had two children. I made nice money at the lamp shades, 1
               wouldn’t say a lot—just a helping hand.
               JUDY: How long have you been doing this (a bed cover similar to
               a quilt)!
               SARAH: About two years. She [Enid) taught me how, and my
               daughter is in merchandising and gets me swatches of material for
               nothing. I try not to have two colors the same. If 1 have a good
               green, I like to finish it with a brown. Enid is very good for colors;
               sometimes make a mistake and put two colors the same. 1 know l’m
               not careful.
               ENID: Because you’re in a hurry.
               SARAH: If I wasn’t in a hurry I wouldn’t have great-grand-
               children. I have one 20 years old.
               DEE: How did you learn to make these, Enid?
               ENID: In Jamaica, the people had sufficient interest in the
               youngsters, so they would formulate a sewing class at home and they
               would teach you the different things to do. One of my sisters used to
               have a class and 1 watched.
               DEE: Have you thought about selling them?
               ENID: Who, me? No.
               SARAH: How could she get a customer? She wants 8500.
               ENID: To be honest, l’m not kidding.
               SARAH: I’m not kidding either when I know that nobody in the
               world would give you or me—not even 8200
               DEE: Did people make those things for sale in Jamaica?
               ENID: They would make appliqué things in Jamaica for a living.
               They would have an organization and the girls get a weekly or
               monthly salary. Then it goes to the store where the tourist comes in
               it gets the price. You must know the value of handwork to pay for it
               DEE: What did your mother do in Jamaica?
               ENID: She had nine children.
               DEE: Did she do needlework at home?
               ENID: Yes, she sewed my father’s shirts and my brother’s shirts.
               SARAH: My mother sewed by hand till the minute she died.
               There were not machines in my mother’s day. Later 1 had a
               machine already and she used to come over to my house and bring
               me sewing. She always basted it and made me new curtains all the
               time.</p>

               KATHLINE IDELLA THOMPSON, My Mother, and DORA LUCINDA
               JOHNSON, My Maternal Grandmother, by Phyllis Thompson
               Dora Lucinda Johnson is 82 years old. The mother of seven chil-
               dren, she resided on a farm in Seneca, Maryland for 70 years. Since
               the death of her husband in 1974, she has lived with her daughter,
               Kathline Thompson, in Philadelphia. Kathline Idella Thompson is
               awidowed mother of four children. Presently, she is a tax examiner
               for the Department of Internal Revenue in Philadelphia.
               PHYLLIS: Where were you living Granny, when you were piec-
               ing quilts?
               GRANDMOTHER: Darnestown, Maryland, I reckon.
               MOTHER: Probably out Sugarland where she grew up.
               GRANDMOTHER: Out Sugarland. Maybe so, I reckon—maybe
               it was out Sugarland.
               MOTHER: I don’t know whether she is referring to when she was
               a child or after she was grown up and married. 1 know very little
               about where she lived when she was growing up. When I remember
               about you quilting, you were married then . . . you had us
               GRANDMOTHER: I was grown up? Don’t remember whether I
               was married or not when 1 was piecing quilt squares . . . 1 used to
               piece lots of them.
               PHYLLIS: Did you create particular kinds of designs or patterns
               that had names?
               GRANDMOTHER: I make four pieces you know, like that, then
               sew’um together, then make another strip, sew it together, then . ..
               PHYLLIS: You worked with four squares sewn together. ...
               GRANDMOTHER: Yes, I had my squares cut.
               PHYLLIS: Were all of your quilts in square patterns? Were there
               circles or triangles
               GRANDMOTHER: Just straight squares ... used to make
               squares, you know . . . something like that. We sew’um togethei
               ... we sew all four squares together, take another strip of materia
               and put on all four sides and sew it together.
               PHYLLIS: Where did you get the fabric scraps?
               GRANDMOTHER: We saved the scraps. My mother did sewing
               you see and she saved the scraps and things to make quilts—quilt
               pieces. Lots of people used to bring sewing for her to do.
               PHYLLIS.
               PHYLLIS: She could sew very well then, and made extra money
               GRANDMOTHER: Very little.
               for her family. Did you ever make quilts for your family?
               MOTHER:
               GRANDMOTHER: No. I used to piece quilt squares and things
               throw rugs to put in the kitchen.
               like that when I was home with my mother. I pieced’um for her-
               PHYLLIS:
               she used to make quilts. She’d get material to put on the back side
               then take some raw cotton to put in between, then she had a thing
               MOTHER:
               called a rack you know, to put the quilt on. We get the quilt on the
               rack and hang it up and the quilt would be rolled up during the day
               and down at night when we were working.
               PHYLLIS: You would hang it up . . . how? From the ceiling?
               GRANDMOTHER: Yes, from the rafters. We’d sit there and sew
               on it. . . . make little strips across the quilt, about that wide and
               connect the squares.
               PHYLLIS: Well, well . . . here is one right here. About how long
               did it take to complete a quilt?
               starch. How was that done?
               GRANDMOTHER: It depended on how long I worked on it.
               MOTHER: I’m not sure of course, but I think her mother did
               this. Aren’t these some that you got from up Granmumma’s house
               after she died? Because after she had all of us, she didn’t have time
               to do that.
               GRANDMOTHER: Whose is that? They look like some of mine.
               attracted to them, but they weren’t.
               MOTHER: This came out of your trunk. I think she helped do</p>
            <p>
               . ongen n dern asnte aanas e Lalte daste enen
               that. This was done on the sewing machine too.
               GRANDMOTHER: Well, I used to do some on the sewing ma-
               chine—some by hand and some on the sewing machine.
               MOTHER: I just ran upstairs and grabbed these while you were

               lot of time to quilt after her children were grown.
               GRANDMOTHER: When we were little girls, we were taught
               how to sew squares and then Momma would put them together.
               Did you do any crocheting or knitting
               The only knitting I know of her doing was these little
               Those knitted rugs made out of old stockings and
               socks. When did you learn how to crochet and knit?
               When I started high school. Well, you know, I learned
               the basic beginning stitches. I would follow directions to crochet
               doilies. I never really knitted anything. I just learned plain knitting
               I liked to crochet. I crocheted quite a few doilies, but they were
               small. At one time. I used to use them a lot.
               PHYLLIS: Yes, I remember when you used them. I recall that
               there were many women in the Projects who had ruffled doilies in
               their homes. That was at least 20 years ago. You washed and starch-
               ed the doilies on Saturdays. Sometimes you used a sugar mixture for
               MOTHER: I would starch my doilies, but that didn’t make them
               stand up. My neighbor showed me how to fix a starch out of sugar
               and water. You soaked the doily in the sugar mixture and it began to
               dry, you pulled up the ruffled sides and they would stand stiff and
               remain in place. You know, l’m surprised that the roaches weren’t</p>

               Te fern uoman q imporlanee 1o me dus one o nug an teneler,
               Ida Kohlmeyer. I made a special trip to New Orleans to interview
               her and to speak of her past and our relationship at Sophie New-
               comb College where I studied art in the 1960s.
               LYNDA: Ida, how did you happen to come to art?
               IDA: I’Il begin at the beginning. . . . I was not young, almost 29
               years old, grievously immature and becoming aware of the shatter-
               ing fact that my life was without purpose. I attribute my “growing
               up to the experience encountered as a soldier’s wife during war-
               time, and to the sobering thought that life might well come to an
               abrupt and premature end without much warning.
               My exposure to art had been sporadic and meagre. I turned to it,
               I think, with a lingering dilletantism, expecting to find it mildly ab-
               sorbing. I have never been so mistaken about anything before or
               since. At the urging of a friend, who was aware of my dilemma, 1
               enrolled in the John McCrady School in New Orleans, and was
               there initiated into the exhilaration of creative work.
               The following fall, I signed up as a part-time student at the New-
               comb Art School of Tulane University to take drawing and painting.
               After two years I began working toward a Master of Fine Arts
               degree. Because of a part-time curriculum, two small children and
               not too brilliant progress, it took four years to complete the require-
               ments for the degree. The summer of 1956 I attended Hans Hoff-
               man’s School in Provincetown, and during the spring of 1957, Mark
               Rothko came to Newcomb as artist-in-residence. Both of these art-
               ists were great influences in my life.
               LYNDA: I think it was unusual that an artist with your back-
               ground should have had the seriousness of purpose to pursue your
               interests with both of these major artists.
               It was your professionalism that impressed me, for 1 had never
               had real contact before with a woman artist. You always were pre-</p>

               STELLA CHASTEEN by Barbara Zucker</p>
            <p>
               Alligator Birthday Cake</p>
            <p>
               Cakes are like clowns. Both are so deeply imbedded in our culture
               that their strangeness is ignored
               The day I got married the car broke down so my parents drove us
               to our wedding. I sat in the back seat looking up front at the card-
               board box which held the cake wedged in between my parents. Two
               circles had been cut out of the top so that the heads of the tiny china
               bride and groom had enough room to peek out. It looked like people
               in a surreal sweat box.
               In Florida I once had a student whose art was all about food and
               feeding people. In one piece a thin girl lay still on a table for hours.
               wearing the entire meal which spread down around her in carefu.
               patterns. Spectators consumed bits from her throughout the even-
               ing. Ethel Ann’s real piece de resistance was her Master’s project
               an exorcism of her marriage. She made a gigantic wedding cake
               carved of wood and foam, complete with doves, net, roses and fes
               toons. In the performance she stood on the cake, wearing her wed
               ding dress, talking out her marriage. A man in a tux acted the
               groom and other performers straightened up, made beds, fetchec
               and carried. She also baked a traditional wedding cake and mixec
               some punch which the audience consumed. Her work-for-money
               and her art work overlapped. She cooked each week for an entire
               church congregation—shopped, baked and served the Sunday meal
               Stella Chasteen lives in Woodstock with her three children and
               her husband. Trained in art academies in London, she came to
               America in the sixties. She stopped painting because she “didn’i
               know what to paint.” Her cakes, which she makes as an act of love
               for her children, are wonderful.
               STELLA: My first cake was a car
               BARBARA: How do you carve it
               STELLA: I bake the cakes, then freeze them and carve it while
               theyre frozen. 1 can carve it quite precisely frozen. It doesn’t crum-
               ble or squoosh. 1 use poundcake because it’s a nice solid consisten-
               cy, not too heavy. Someone advised me to use toothpicks to hold it
               together.
               The first one was such a success. The children said, “I want one
               too, 1 want one too.” They can think up whatever they want. The
               mountain cake, I had just started teaching Tom how to ski. His
               birthday is in the winter. You can always tell what he was into that
               year by what his cake was. The others are more into their fantasies.
               I did a monster head for Rhody. Sometimes they give specific direc-
               tions. Tessa’s dog had to be black and white. Rhody’s monster had
               to have a head that was half blue and half green. After that, at a
               school fund-raising I made miniature monster heads. I used cashew</p>
            <p>
               nuts for horns. All the kids bought up the cakes immediately.
               I use regular butter frosting and then color it with food coloring
               and when I want real white I have to get white butter.
               I made Tessa a fairy. It was the most difficult because it was tall
               and tended to topple over. It was a hot day in June and the fairy
               kept falling; I had to keep propping it up. I painted the fairy’s face
               like a china doll. It was holding a magic wand which was a sparkler
               which I lit
               There was a show at the Victoria and Albert Museum in London
               of cakes. A friend saw the show and said my cakes could have been
               there. I said, “No,” because for me it is very important that the
               cakes be eaten. I would have a totally different attitude about what
               I was making if it was going to be around for any length of time. It
               can be more outrageous, more goofy—it’s carefully considered, but
               not in the same way as something permanent. Besides, the kids get
               such a thrill out of eating it. It’s sort of gory: “I want the head, I
               want the eye, give me the leg!” It’s great!
               I like to make use of edible stuff to decorate them with and find
               unusual things. For the wheels of Rhody’s car I found cookies that
               looked like spokes of a wheel. For Tessa’s dog’s ears I used Oreo
               cookies. I once made Tessa a circus cake. All the ropes and trapezes
               were made out of shoelace licorice.
               BARBARA: Why don’t you have more photographs of them?
               STELLA: I make the cake the morning of the party. It takes
               about three hours just to decorate. Then l’ve got to get the party
               together. The rush of the party prevents taking pictures. I never
               have any film in the camera. For the tropical island cake, you know
               that health food sugar? I used that for sand for the beaches. I also
               made a traditional English castle with gray frosting. The grownups
               looked at the frosting and said, “eeeough, gray frosting!” but the
               kids thought it was terrific because it looked like a castle. I bought
               knights on horseback and little flags to fly from the turrets. I love
               doing it.
               BARBARA: Is there anything else that gives you that kind of
               pleasure?
               STELLA: Yes, pottery does, ceramics. Actually, making it is
               what’s so nice about the cake. It’s all in the doing of it. Then it's
               gone. It’s not sitting around. The appreciation is immediate. You’ve
               got all the kids who come to the birthday party.
               BARBARA: You don’t think of them as art?
               STELLA: No, I don’t really.
               BARBARA: Why not
               STELLA: I think of them as cakes.

               Barbara Schaff—pottery
               Joan Wortis—weaving
               Pat Frank—goldsmith
               Vivian O’David—quilting
               Adele Blumberg—embroidery
               Lois Gerb—rug hooking
               Paula Wachtel—Ikebana (Japanese flower arranging)
               BARBARA: You are talking to a potter who’s into function. I
               have been through a kind of soul-searching siege about whether I
               should make ART, capital letters, the way most of my contemporar-
               ies are doing, and 1 very self-consciously set out to do that, which, of
               course ended in total disaster because it wasn’t fun, wasn’t free and
               I didn’t enjoy it very much. 1 make things that are according to my
               grandmother’s proverb who, may she rest in peace, was Russian
               ... she said, “You should never have anything in your home but
               what is useful and beautiful.” I make very simple, very quiet, useful
               things for everyday because I have this vague philosophy that it en-
               riches the quality of human life to use handmade things. I don’t be-
               lieve in using good things only for company—Who is company? 1
               deserve good things. 1 am a maker of crocks and jugs and cups and
               mugs and teapots and bowls and everything that you can possibly
               use in the kitchen. Very primitive, very traditional, tremendousl
               satisfying.
               MADGE: Joan, what about your weaving?
               JOAN: I feel very close to what Barbara is saying. I do functional
               work.
               BARBARA: It goes against the trend.
               JOAN: Yes, very much against the trend. I make garments for
               both women and men, primarily for women. I came to it really from
               a great love of folk art, which l’ve always been attracted to—partic-
               ularly embroidered things, woven things. I want things to be worn.
               l’m not making things that you might wear once to a costume
               ball—1 want people to wear things to adorn themselves and fee
               beautiful in what I make.
               BARBARA: Neither one of us designs anything for use only. Aes-
               thetic considerations are extremely important. It has to be both use-
               ful and beautiful.
               DEE: This issue is concerned with breaking down these barriers.
               Not considering yourself an artist because of the attitude toward
               crafts
               BARBARA: That’s a tempest in a teapot. Art versus craft.
               JOAN: That position—that your work is an art work, the pots no
               longer have openings, they are nonfunctional pots, the weaving is no
               longer weaving—that is for use, for a floor cover or a wall cover to
               keep out the cold or on the body. It becomes a wall hanging in the
               same way that a painting is. Those of us who are working in the
               contemporary crafts market, as Barbara and 1 are, are sometimes
               made to feel like second-class citizens because we are not arts/crafts
               people.
               PATTY: I think of myself as an artist, and it doesn’t matter what
               I work in, l’m an artist, period. I think Barbara’s an artist even
               though she’s very stubborn about considering herself a craftsperson.
               Anybody who has an idea, takes some material and transforms it in-
               to something usable, whether you hang it on the wall or put soup
               into it or stick it on your arm, that is an art object. If nobody in the
               world likes it except you or your mother, then you have a problem.
               PAULA: Poverty.
               PATTY: Right. Or you get a job in the supermarket and so you
               have time to do the other stuff. We’re all artists. Painters are just as
               much craftspeople, if they’re worth their salt, because they have to
               learn how to deal with the materials they work with.
               DEE: How did you get into jewelry?
               PATTY: My mother and aunt dragged me through lots of depart
               ment stores. My mother would give me jewelry to play with, good
               costume pieces. I would sit around and stare at them for hours-
               they were like things I played with as a kid. When I got into college,
               I had rocks which were semi-precious stones and I thought I would
               take a jewelry course to cut stones. I had an instant rapport with the
               silver. 1 sold my first ring in three days and I thought, my goodness,
               I didn’t sell my first painting. So the monetary aspect of my person-
               ality . . . hm, there’s gold in them thar hills.</p>

            <p>
               Part of a discussion by Dee Shapiro and Madge Huntington</p>
            <p>
               DEE: Now your mother is collecting your jewelry.
               PATTY: I can’t keep anything that’s gold around my mother. It’s
               like the company store; 1 borrowed money from her, then she says,
               “Let’s work a deal.” She’s got three of my chains.
               BARBARA: Now you know how I feel. l’m into Patty up to my
               neck in hock.
               JOAN: But isn’t the satisfaction wonderful to have all those things
               people made
               BARBARA: I’m a trade junkie.
               JOAN: We go to the craft fairs, running around looking at other
               people’s things and wanting to live with the things that other people
               have made with their hands, which we couldn’t afford.
               PATTY: Right. I can’t afford to keep my jewelry.
               MADGE: Vivian, are you a crafts artist aside from being a school
               principal?
               VIVIAN: No. What I think makes me legitimate in this group is
               that 1 came into quilting via a sister. I lost my sister a year ago and
               l’ve gone on with the work because it’s something l’ve grown up
               with. I brought along with me a quilt my grandmother did, it’s over
               100 years old.
               DEE: I think many of the crafts came out of a definite need for
               the objects as a function in the home.
               JOAN: However, there were the crazy quilts that were done in the
               latter half of the nineteenth century, and l’ve seen many of them
               come pristine out of the trunk and never been backed, never been
               used. Why?
               VIVIAN: I think even with the 11 children, no doubt there would
               have been one quilt that was put someplace that certain people saw
               and the rest of you wouldn’t.
               ADELE: T’ve always worked with the needle.
               VIVIAN: And beautifully.
               ADELE: From the time I was five until now, which is a considera-
               ble number of years, I have always had something in my hand or in
               my pocketbook. If I travel, I always have something with me. And
               it’s amazing how you get contact with perfect strangers if you’ve got
               something in your hands. We were in Cuzco, Peru, and our plane
               was about five hours late. I was working on that seat you’re sitting
               on, Dee. An Indian woman with a baby was learning these stitches
               with me, and it was the most wonderful thing . . . 1 wanted to give
               her child a doll that we had just bought; she said no, she couldn’t ac-
               cept it because she made it (the doll). So we were exchanging our
               crafts and a perfect stranger took pictures of us and sent them to
               me. Me with this Indian woman learning these stitches. For me, the
               culmination of a busy day is when we can sit down at 11 o’clock and
               watch the news and I don’t have to do any other work. You don’t
               have to watch television, you can listen, you can be with your hus-
               band, you’re doing something with your hands, and you’re creating
               something. Before I was married 1 had this tremendous passion to
               accomplish all of these things. Wherever I went visiting relatives.
               l’d take my tablecloths along with me. And they used to kid me.
               don’t know if they were hurt that I was doing it. Some men object il
               you sit and embroider in front of them at board meetings.
               PATTY: You can be a total participant. You basically make these
               decisions and it’s just a matter of moving the needle. It’s not coming
               from the part of you that you need to listen and speak and think
               with
               ADELE: You spoke about wanting to keep what you do. I know
               that what I make has really very little value, unless I put it on a
               good piece of linen, but you can’t compare it with a goldsmith’s
               work. 1 feel very possessive about what l’ve done and I don’t give it
               to anyone except people that are very close to me. Organizations say
               now see how much hand stuff you can bring in for the bazaar or for
               the auction and we’ll have a big sale . . . I give of myself all the time
               to the community, but never my needlework. I still have the little
               crooked tea towel I did at age five because my mother wouldn’t
               throw it out.</p>

               and lilies-of-the valley that we learned to search out in the shadouy spots inour oun yard and pick for Mothers Day, roses tha
               grew on crooked, thorny stems with rough, toothy leaves, each one a simple perfection out of which my grandmother picked
               Japanese beetles, dropping them with their glistening green-and-purple backs into a rusty can of kerosene.
               There was a cherry tree whose fruit we never ate because the birds got there first. Beyond that was the vegetable garden.
               There grandmother’s flowers found a place, one corner graced with arching stems of bleeding hearts and regal purple irises,
               The house was big, open and inviting, full of textures and smells and old-fashioned colors. The wallpaper in the foyer had lit-
               tle pastoral figures repeating themselves in identical landscapes along the stairs. The paint on the ceiling above my bed was old,
               peeling off in places and resembling in one spot an old hag with a long nose. My room was papered pink and green, my grand-
               mother’s favorite colors, and had the musty, long-used, faded smell that pervaded the house. My grandmother had a wringer
               washing machine in the cleaning room off the kitchen. It had its own smell of old clothes and soap, and the clean/rotten smell of
               potato peelings and other organic leavings that were kept separate from the burnable garbage. On the door she kept an old
               calendar with the saying, “Oh, Lord, Thy sea is so great and my boat is so small.
               She braided rugs. She bought old wool coats at rummage sales, tore them apart, cut them into strips, folded, stitched and
               braided them into long coils. One of these rugs was on the floor of the dining room, all dark browns and greens and tweeds.
               My grandmother kept things. In her sewing room there were always piles of clothes from rummage sales, dresser drawers
               filled with jewelry, gloves and other fine, delicate things. Knick-knacks were all over the house, and a wonderful eight-day clock
               under a glass bell sat on the mantle in the living room
               She wore dark print dresses that came down past her knees, and she looked like I thought all grandmothers looked: solid
               peasant stock from Eastem Europe, apron tied at her waist, hands gnarled from tending her flowers, smelling wonderfully like
               her kitchen or the earth in her garden.
               There is a church in the town, and my grandmother often provided flowers for the altar from her garden. I used to tremble
               when my grandmother, in her goodness, walked right up to the altar and arranged the vases on it. The Church teaches humility
               and service through its female saints; certainly my grandmother belongs with that long-suffering celestial choir
               Why are there no flowers on my grandmother’s grave? Since she died, eight years ago, 1 have grown up, and my memories of
               her have been disturbed by the glimpses my mother has given me of another side of this woman.
               She was very bitter, she was ready to die,” my mother told me. My mother’s own anger distilled into bitterness as she talked
               about my grandfather’s travels with his new wife. My grandmother had always wanted to travel, but never had.
               “She would not see the priest who came to visit.
               "She . . . had to lie in the bed she made for herself.” What a cold, cruel thing to say. She had encouraged my grandfather to
               play the role of a man as she knew it, and he did. He hung around with the boys. They grew apart. When she died, my grand-
               father married a woman who would be a companion.
               My grandmother was caught in the center of a web of caring she had spun around all of us. I find I never really knew her. No
               one talks of her, no one reminisces. The family has scattered, the children have grown, the house is no longer the center of a vital
               network. Weeds have taken over the garden; 1 believe my grandfather has mowed it down.
               Grandmother’s bitterness seems to have come from what she did with her life. Yet for me as a child, she was part of an undif
               ferentiated environment of warmth, comfort and beauty.

               Stenciled tray by Alice Watters Beebe</p>
            <p>
               My first clear memory of my mother is of her fishing in hipboots in a northern lake, casting with one of her own flies-gorgeous
               bugs with fantastic wings which she had tied herself from brightly colored feathers and bits of materials.
               In the late thirties Mother and a group of her friends became interested in stenciling. They researched old designs and
               redesigned them for application on trays, lamps, chairs, boxes. The stencils were cut from a very hard waxed linen paper so that
               the edges stayed sharp and clear despite much use. To celebrate my wedding Mother stenciled a design on the walls of our living
               room. These women worked hard and were very serious about their work. They were middle-class women without aggressive or
               competitive ambitions in the business world. They didn’t object to working commercially but did so only if asked. One might il-
               lustrate a child’s book; one might paint greeting cards. Mother even translated children’s books into Braille. Despite the profes
               sional quality of these women s' work it was primarily for their own pleasure and that of their families. The quilts they designed</p>

               and sewed went on their own beds. The rugs they hooked or braided went on their floor. My father, however, brought my
               mother’s stenciled trays to elegant stores like Hammacher Schlemmer’s to sell with the outdoor furniture which he designed and
               built after his retirement.
               Most discarded items or worn-out materials were preserved as grist for the household mill. Stockings and clothes were kept
               for rugmaking or cleaning rags. Broken bottles were for scraping furniture, paper bags for absorbing cooking grease,
               newspapers for laying fires with one special pleated fan to dress up the kindling. The recycling was continuous. It was part of
               running a home.
               Mother invented all sorts of gadgets which my brother tried to patent. Every possible drawer in the kitchen cupboards opened
               into the dining room as well as the kitchen. There was a special holder for soaking brushes upright, a knitting yarn winder and
               lamps that swung on long arms
               Mother respected and understood the unpredictable in nature. She studied the agricultural information published by the
               state, learning about crop rotation, and even after we no longer had animals, continued to cultivate the fields for hay. She never
               quite believed that the flowers she crossed and the trees she grafted would take.
               Mother made a vegetable and berry garden, a flower garden and a rose garden. In the cellar under the carriage barn, she
               grew mushrooms.
               The planning of all her gardens was quite similar to outdoor environmental sculpture. She never imposed a formal design but
               used the land as she found it. Rocks were centers for small flowers, “hens and chickens,” succulents and herbs. An existing
               shrub might be tied into the rest of the garden by more massive clumps of tall plants. The land was planned with appropriate
               flowers for knolls and valleys, sun and shade. In my memory all the flowers were an exaggerated extension of the wild flowers in
               the field around them. My sister calls this an old-fashioned garden.
               When we had cows, mother made butter and cottage cheese and buttermilk, the by-product. The milking was done by hand
               and then came the separating of the milk and the cream. There seemed to be a countless number of discs to the separator. Then
               came the slow endless turning of the handle of the big wooden churn until the butter suddenly came.
               Mother also raised bees and for a short time we had our own honey until Mother, who scorned most of the protective bee
               costume, nearly died of bee sting
               She took great pleasure in growing vegetables and fruit and canning them. We all gathered berries for her jelly making. She
               was a champion blueberry picker. She made both elderberry and blackberry wine. We probably had one of the first freezers, a
               memorable event. Half of our favorite vegetable, peas, instead of being eaten fresh, were frozen.
               Late in life she became excited by the possibilities of reproducing old china designs, pots of her own, and glazing. She enrolled
               at the Sharon Art Center nearby and eventually had her own kilns and worked at home.
               She was a shy, small woman, prophetic in her time, generously responsive, filled with a natural curiosity and a great love of
               the earth</p>

               LUCHITA HURTADO</p>
            <p>
               My family lived in Caracas, Venezuela. Ladies at that time, nervously twirling their rosaries, drove
               down the perpendicular dangerous road to bathe in the sea. It was believed that the ocean had curative
               powers. Huge bathhouses stood on the coastline, waves pounding and resounding in their cavernous in-
               teriors, the dusky air pierced with streaks of sunlight while crabs walked the high ledges and the women
               and children squealed with delight. It was during a sojourn at the beach, a little over half a century ago,
               that I was born. Memories of my childhood still invade today’s reality. Padre Peñalber, our parish
               priest, is at least partly responsible for my lifelong aversion to a certain shade of pink. He was a short
               stocky man with very bushy eyebrows and a thunderous voice. Cassock swinging, he walked staring
               at the line of children waiting to hear what the color of their angel dresses would be for the Easter mass
               At that time dark complexioned children were thought to look best in pink and so 1 would try
               holding my breath, hoping that perhaps my complexion would change. 1 was invariably unsuccess
               ful in these attempts for when he looked at me, he would always say, “Pink. You are a pink angel
               Little girls with papier mache wings strapped to their backs were placed on a scaffold around the
               altar kneeling on a space hardly larger than a small cushion. I never knew whether 1 had sud-
               denly grown too tall to be an angel or whether, rebelling against the pink I wore, 1 disrup
               ted the mass by falling asleep kneeling on one of the higher platforms. Whatever the rea-
               son, 1 was never again chosen to be an angel at Easter. Being a painter, color has always
               been a very important part of my life. I go through color periods when anything purple or
               .
               red or green or blue seems magically endowed, but never ever a certain shade of pink.
               Venezuelan girls were taught to sew at an early age. They didn’t knit—the tropical climate cancelled out any warm
               clothing—but they did sew, crochet, embroider and make beautiful lace. I don’t believe 1 ever saw a group of women working
               together on a common project; rather, they worked alone, even if in a group, spending long hours embroidering a pillow case or
               making a lace doily.
               My grandmother, Rosario, taught me how to sew. If she caught sight of me sitting under a tree enjoying the afternoon breeze,
               she would ask me to bring her my favorite dress. “Idle hands tempt the devil,” she would say; then together we would undo the
               hem. Once done, she would say,“Now, sew it up again and let me see how well you can do it.”It never occurred to me to ask her
               why it was that when I daydreamed I was tempting the devil, whereas when boys daydreamed they were lost in thought, plan-
               ning some great project.
               1 didn’t like to sew then, and it took me years to discover that it could be a pleasurable experience. When I became pregnant
               with my first son in New York, I learned to enjoy sewing. In the forties, when he was born, the only maternity clothes available
               in stores were called “butcher boy” dresses with an ugly hole cut out in the skirt. 1 had a vision of a long, silk, black and white
               striped dress with a velvet ribbon and red geraniums and promptly began to make it. It took me weeks and because 1 set the
               sleeves in backward, I had to stand with my shoulders at an odd angle. However, what I remember most is how good I felt when
               1 finished and wore it. When my son, Daniel, was born, the dress had been so constantly worn that, like the placenta, it was
               discarded in the process. I went on sewing then whenever I coveted some imagined piece of clothing or visualized my infant son
               in a red vest with blue satin ribbons. Sewing has afforded me great satisfaction through the years.

               black velvet dots
               and ribbons.</p>
            <p>
               I was a Scotch lass one fall, a Russian princess the next winter. I had feather or fur-trimmed hats to match every coat and lace-
               collared, lovingly hand-tucked party dresses. The buttons on my blouses were ceramic fruits or mother-of-pearl hearts; enam-
               eled flowers closed my sweaters. I was the embodiment of my mother’s fantasies—the outlet for her frustrated talents. Trained
               in Poland as a fine seamstress, she emigrated to America at 18, took a course at the Traphagen School of Fashion and became a
               dress designer. My father believed that a wife’s place was in the home, and even though her income would have been a welcome
               addition to the small salary he earned as a Yiddish poet working for the Yiddish newspapers, she stopped working to take care
               of their home, and me, their only child.
               She designed and sewed every kind of clothing for the two of us; shirts, ties, jackets, pyjamas and bathrobes for my father;
               curtains, slipcovers, bedspreads for the house. Her sewing machine in the bedroom was overflowing with projects. Scraps of
               fabrics and pieces of thread were always on the rugs and floor.
               Sometimes she took me with her to hunt for the fabrics—remnants were all she could afford. We would plow through rolled
               up bundles of cloth wrapped around the middle with a strip of brown paper. The material would tumble out when you pulled
               one end of the string that tied it together. We searched through boxes of laces, trimmings, scraps of fur, end pieces of em-
               broidered ribbons, all scraps that could be bought for a few cents by anyone who could think of a way to use them
               Usually the remnants were wrapped the wrong side out. It wasn’t until we got home and opened them that we were able to see
               their full beauty. My mother always knew what treasures she had found. “Look,” she’d say, fondling a piece, “this French silk
               moire, how it reflects the light; this Italian knit, it must have mohair in it, feel how it moves.
               There was such challenge and excitement when she started making something. Almost always, the pattern called for more
               yardage than was in the remnant, and she would hover over the fabric on the floor, clouds of pattern pieces surrounding her
               tape measure draped around her neck, folding and unfolding in every conceivable way until she managed to maneuver the two-
               and-five-eighths yard remnant to make a three-and-a-half yard skirt. It was magical to me; she could make something out of
               anything, out of nothing. I could almost see the fabric grow to fit the need. Then she would pick up her enormous shears and
               begin to cut. (1 once used those shears to cut out some paper doll clothes, and got one of the worst spankings of my
               childhood—those shears were only for fabric.)
               This past summer I found myself in a junkyard, trying to pull a beautifully patinaed piece of two-inch pipe from under a pile
               of 1-beams. It was a hot, muggy day. I was going to the beach when I spotted this likely-looking heap of scrap, and felt com-
               pelled to stop. As I tugged at the pipe, sticky and sweating, trying not to stab my sandaled feet with a sharp rusted iron bar,
               cursing, I wondered: What in the world am I doing here? Why this need to stop and explore every junkyard? Why is my studio
               full of scraps of stéel pipe and sheeting and odd iron shapes?</p>

               Tremember once when I was about 12 years old I tried to make a pair of sandals and a brassiere from some pink satin scraps of
               material my mother, Willi Posey, had given me. She was the first person to teach me to sew as her mother, Ida, had taught her.
               The tradition of teaching and sewing in our family probably goes back to our roots in Africa. My mother remembers watching
               her grandmother, Betsy Bingham, boil and bleach flour sacks until they were “white as snow” to line the quilts she made.
               Mother also remembers Betsy cutting out basket shapes, triangles and circles out of brightly colored scraps of material to create
               the design of the quilt.
               Susie Shannon, Betsy’s mother, had taught her to sew quilts. She was a slave and had made quilts for the plantation owners
               as part of her duties as “house girl.” Undoubtedly many of the early American quilts with repetitive geometric designs are slave-
               made and African-influenced.</p>
            <p>
               Ida, my grandmother, made clothes for a living when she came north from Jacksonville, Florida, after her husband died in
               1910. He had been a teaching principal setting up schools in Florida and South Carolina, moving frequently to the next place
               that needed him and could pay for his services. Ida taught with him in the South, but up North there was no job for her and she
               still had two young children to support.
               My mother made our clothes, and sewed for friends free during the depression years. She created original designs and made
               and cut her own patterns. By the forties, no longer a housewife, she was making a living sewing and giving seasonal fashion
               shows of her designs. Many are high fashion today, such as the bat-wing sleeves and knee-length pants.
               My mother was always an artist, but she thinks of herself as a business woman, and measures her success by the number of
               steady customers she designs for during each season. Today she is in her seventies and her five or six steady customers keep hei
               in business wearing “Posey” originals.</p>

               Ijust came across this photo of my mother in-law, Celia, now dead. She had nine children and lived in utter poverty in
               Williamsburg, Brooklyn. Her husband worked in a sweatshop and studied the Torah.
               Celia’s art was “making do,” patching up, stretching the dollar. She boasted that the only thing she threw out were egg-
               shells—“and to begin with, the eggs can be bought cracked for next to nothing.” She knew of a place to buy stale bread which
               was “better for you than fresh bread.” She’d cut up old telephone books into six-inch squares and use this for toilet paper. Once
               she came to my house and stared at the soapy water gushing out of the washing machine into the sink. With the speed of lighten-
               ing, she was triumphantly caught the water in a pail, so that it could be used for washing the floor.
               Now that I think of it, there was one extravagance: the small bouquet of fresh flowers that traditionally enhanced her “Sab-
               bath Table." This she would arrange and rearrange.</p>

               Many of my childhood memories center around the women of the family and their work. Both my mother’s and father’s parents
               lived 25 miles from us in a small farming community and we visited them each Sunday. My maternal grandmother lived on a
               ranch that grew grapes and peaches. My twin sister Janice and I never looked forward to those Sunday trips, but our boredom
               was relieved when Grandma was making a quilt. We would quilt while the men went outside to smoke or sit under the umbrella
               tree. Sometimes the quilting frame staved up for weeks and no one thought it strange that it took up most of the living room.
               The depression had brough renewed interest in many kinds of needlework because of the poor money situation and the need
               to use spare time profitably. The women’s magazines were filled with needlework patterns for embellishing dresses, towels and
               table linens. Neither my mother nor my grandmother could read a crochet pattern, but both could easily work from a piece
               already made. With friends they formed a women’s group in the early 1930s to trade new ideas for crochet projects or stitches.
               In 1934 after we moved to a new town Mother went to the Methodist Church once a week to make quilts for the missionairies
               She would take us along and we would play on the floor around the “sewing ladies.” Within a few years this group would be
               sewing for the Red Cross and the war effort. Twenty-five years earlier my mother had learned to knit for the service men during
               World War I.
               My father’s mother, Emma Braun, was a rugmaker who had learned her craft as a child in Canada. There was a small room
               in her house that held her rug frame, fabric scraps and burlap. She was constantly searching for good burlap sacks and wool</p>

               clothing from the Salvation Army stores. When wool was hard to find, she dyed cotton sheet blankets for rug strips. She de
               signed her own patterns and carefully drew them on the burlap before starting to hook. 1 was about 11 years old and visiting her
               in the summer when she taught me the process of washing and preparing the rags, stretching and sewing the burlap to the
               frame, and doing the hooking. Rugmaking is a solitary craft and Emma Braun was a very private person. She said that when
               other women went to quilting bees, she preferred to stay home and spend part of each day working on a rug. She hooked about
               40 rugs in her lifetime, the largest one, 8’ x 10’. The last rug I remember her making was made for me when she was 82.
               There are few days in my life when I am not involved with some kind of handwork. My mother and I talked about it recently
               and discovered we were both filled with guilt if there was spare time available and we had no “projects” to work on. She thought
               it was our nature to be that way. I think it is because neither of us ever saw our mothers idle.</p>

            <p>
               1am an ex-mother, ex-housewife who grew up in a home
               where evidence of my creative heritage was displayed on
               every bed. My mother never completed a quilt herself—they
               were all given to her by women relatives for her wedding-
               but she sewed all our clothes, made curtains, slipcovered
               couches and insisted that my sister and 1 learn to sew well.
               When I was married at 18, she gave me a sewing machine.
               During my ten years of marriage, my need to be creative
               was suppressed, except for decorating the house, making
               things for the kids, conquering new recipes. Following my
               two marriages I spent five years in the heterosexual Left at a
               time when both feminism and art, of any but the most bla-
               tantly political kind, were condemned as a bourgeois self-in-
               dulgence. It wasn’t until I stopped doing political work with
               men and began to identify with the women’s community that
               1 felt supported enough to deal with my own creative needs.
               The fact that quiltmaking skills have become a focus for
               me is tied up with my former identification as a homemaker
               and with my self-image as a nonartist. Although I am now a
               lesbian and no longer have any but minimal duties as a
               mother, the home and all the roles connected to it are still po
               tent material for me. It is with women in those roles that 1
               mainly think of sharing my work.
               1 have been doing stitchery for three years now. 1 restrict-
               ed myself to using a needle, thimble and a hoop and set out to
               experience how it was that women had sewn for most of thei
               creative history. I began to understand that both the form
               and the content might have political meaning, and that the
               very act of making stitchery in a way that was respectful of
               tradition could be a celebration of the creative spirit of gener-
               ations of women who have never been considered artists.
               This last year most of my energy has gone into developing
               stitchery as a political art form. I am not at all interested in
               having stitchery elevated to its rightful place among the arts.
               That would make it susceptible to male standards of criti-
               cism, and stitchery, at least at the amateur level, is one of the
               few crafts still controlled by women</p>
            <p>
               Because stitchery is not defined as art and because many
               women have some knowledge of the skills involved, it is no
               as intimidating as other art forms.</p>

               Photographic arrangements
               by Sarah Lyman Bayard</p>
            <p>
               Sarah Lyman Bayard, my grandmother, lived to be 34. She had no formal education. As a young girlshe boarded a ship alone
               and sailed from her village, her parents and ten brothers and sisters to America. Her entire life was sent doing work with her
               hands. She had no concept of what I call art, and the only time I ever heard her mention the word was shortly before she died.
               She told me that upon arriving in this country she had worked as a stitcher in a sweatshop. After her children were born she
               earned money by sewing piecework at home. She would spend many, many hours making men’s suits. “When I finished a
               man’s suit it was a work of art.
               During the last seven years of her life she moved all of her belongings into a room in my parents’ house. Her most prized
               possessions were her pictures. They covered two pieces of furniture in her small room. She had certain systems for arranging the
               pictures. Some were pinned to each other in rows with straight pins, others were just piled or leaning against each other in
               groups. The arrangements and displays were constantly changing. Guests were always invited to see the changing exhibitions.
               She was always seeking newer pictures. She told me that she had never had her own life and that all of the people in the pictures
               had been her life. She said that dusting and hanging the pictures were now her work. She died in 1975. This photo was taken
               a few days after her death.</p>

               The island women love to talk but
               they seldom talk in aesthetic terms
               about the houses which are their medi-
               um and arena for a lifetime. They talk
               maliciously, sentimentally, tartly, and
               vividly about people, animals, crops,
               and weather, things that move and
               change. “Hasn’t he a God-forsaken ap-
               ”“Nothing for it now but to
               pearance?
               put the thought of the evil day on the
               “You have two firm little
               long finger.
               ankle bones that’Il walk you there and
               back again.” Animated and daring
               while describing any event, living in-
               tensely inside their all-purpose kitchen,
               the chameleon like hub of Aran life,
               which changes constantly with each
               chore, meal and ceremony, Kate Con-
               neeley and Nan Mullin treat their
               kitchens like their worn clothes, as
               things to be taken for granted. But the
               two crafts executed by Aran women,
               interior design and knitting, are
               decidedly legitimate art forms, each
               with its aesthetic devices, which could
               not have been developed anywhere ex-
               cept on this slab of rock twelve miles
               out in the Atlantic.
               The Aran house, thatched or slate
               roofed, stands straight up on top of
               sheets of dark gray limestone with
               nothing, no flower borders or architec-
               tural fancies, to soften the abruptness</p>
            <p>
               of its construction. Inside it is mostly a
               kitchen with some adjunct rooms on the
               side for sleeping and storage. This ver-
               satile kitchen exists in marked contrast
               to the raw, for the most part untouched
               rock and soil outside. Within is a world
               of absorbing chores, but there is noth-
               ing at all cozy or domestic about the
               awesome views through the windows or
               open door in Aran. It’s customary in
               this windy place to leave one of the two
               facing kitchen doors open all day for
               light. Shifts in the wind dictate which
               of the two it’s to be. A glance outside
               Nan Mullin’s east-facing kitchen door
               reveals the mountainous Connemara
               coast, a vaulting sky with a drama of
               gargantuan clouds. If a strong wind
               came against it, this door would be shut
               fast, its west-facing twin would be
               opened, and all the daily traffic habits
               would be reversed. The cliff-side view
               is almost Martian in its desolate, ter-
               raced expanse of limestone walls,
               cheered only by “those cheeky devils,
               the foraging chickens in Nan s yard.
               The less affluent houses on the re-
               mote wester tip of Inishmore (largest
               of the three islands that sit at the mouth
               of Galway Bay on the Atlantic coast of
               Ireland) are structurally simple and
               straightforward with little if any mold-
               ing or refined carpentry. The rooms</p>
            <p>
               have thick plaster or mud-covered
               walls, which are divided into upper and
               lower halves of differing colors by a
               border, a strip of patterned paper. One
               of the visual pleasures of these kitchens
               lies in the eccentric deployment of er-
               ratic quantities of paint. A dish cabinet
               or a door is painted from the same can
               of bright enameled paint as a small
               frame around a religious picture. The
               paint used to define a three-dimension-
               al object may show up as a flat band
               around a deep-silled window. The
               movement of the colors—heavy and
               bright worked against luminous white-
               wash—compensates for the minimal
               skills in carpentry and masonry. The
               unpredictable color patches create a
               liveliness and variety in a house made
               up of white and two colors. But what
               colors! A kelly green and a chrome yel-
               low, used in equal amounts. This kin-
               etic, frugal paint scheme keeps the eye
               moving. When a paint can is opened,
               any object that looks woebegone re-
               ceives a fresh coat. It’s an anarchistic
               way to paint. Shelves made of card-
               board receive the same irreverent, care-
               free enameling used on a door. The
               general effect is that paint equals fresh-
               ening.

               be likely to win a home arts competi-
               tion. Most of the items she uses to dec
               orate her home are 80-cent purchases:
               plaster statuettes of the Virgin Mary or
               quickly put together cardboard shelves.
               nothing to compare with the hand
               painted wonders of the Pennsylvania
               Dutch. But the placement of these
               store-bought objects throughout the
               room is witty and innately elegant.
               Rooms dominated by a vivacity of lan
               guage and dramatic physical gestures
               pick up sparkle from the stray spots of
               decoration, the luminous white walls,
               and the vivid shifting of wall levels. Ex-
               cept for the religious items, everything
               in the room is intensely handled: buck-
               ets, kettles and dishes. There is a nat-
               ural flow between room decor and peo-
               ple. Objects with multiple uses seem fit-
               ting for a talkative people with a variety
               of skills. The stove is used for warming
               the room, washing and drying clothes,
               and cooking.
               The Aran people either emigrate or
               stay put—nothing else. Life is con-
               trolled by specific facts of nature and
               history. The lack of trees, the phenom-
               enal wind and rain, and the astonishing
               contiguity of the swarming, changeful
               life in the homes exist side by side with
               the somber Celtic and Christian debris
               (prehistoric forts, beehive dwellings of
               the saints, and Celtic crosses). Every-
               thing goes on within a cultural-psychic
               frame. Just as life is lived within rigor-
               ous structures—of a subsistence econo-
               my, Catholicism, no big city distrac-
               tions, no birth control, no divorce—the

               an island framed by water, framed by
               the Gaelic language; the mantel frames
               the coal stove or the hearth and is itself
               framed by a march of mementos and
               photos across its top.
               Not even Mondrian lived more with-
               in rectilinear plasticity than the woman
               who boils, bakes, mends, churns.
               washes, sweeps, skims and spiffs up her
               gridded workroom. The frame is used
               mostly as a definer, signifying “this is a
               door, this is the cupboard, setting off
               religious chromos with an inexpensive
               wooden frame. The placements, choice
               of objects, designing of the frame never
               seem off-handed, although the spatial
               judgements are never as precise as
               those made by the Shakers. Much of
               the architectural play is achieved by
               hanging frames at various levels, set-
               ting up a rhythm of unpredictable un-
               ions and divisions. There are three
               basic conventions for hanging pictures.
               The first is to hang the largest, always
               Jesus or Mary, about six inches from
               the ceiling, its top edge angled out from
               the wall. The second is to arrange
               groups in relation to the patterned di-
               vider which circles the room. The third
               convention relates objects to the doors
               and windows. A framed prayer, sus-
               pended by a string smack in the center
               above the door, does double duty,
               blessing the house and welcoming the
               visitor. None of the objects is placed
               only for decorative effect: these pres-
               ences are like protectors spotted around
               .. . or connections. They create a stage
               set of cultural locators, defining the

               Ireland, Gaelic-speaking, and their lin-
               eage as either Hernon, O’Brian or Con-
               cannon.
               The most baroque object in any kit-
               chen is the dish cabinet with virtually
               every piece of dishware owned by the
               family on display, exposed and handy
               A flood of plates, mugs, jugs, saucers.
               cups (either plain white or bearing
               stripes or floral patterns), in an inordin-
               ate number of layerings, stackings,
               hanging spots and pattern changes.
               The mantelpiece is runner-up for most
               objects per square foot. Statues of the
               Virgin Mary, the Infant of Prague,
               small porcelain roosters, windup clock,
               battery-run radio, official portraiture:
               John F. Kennedy, Padriac Pearse (the
               Irish nationalist and poet), at least one
               pope, Pius, John or Paul, or St. Martin
               de Porres, a black saint who is a pop-
               ular favorite all over Ireland.
               The baroque condition of the mantel
               top and dish cabinet emphasizes the
               tendency of Aran rooms to throw all
               items into sculptural relief. The small-
               est item, a minute frame with a baby
               photo, a tiny white plastic statue of
               Mary, are tactically transformed by
               framing, color and placement, so that
               each item is emphatically present, a
               strongly defined object. The foot-and-
               a-half thick walls contribute a massive-
               ness that is echoed by other hard-edge
               devices, the space divisions created by
               the borders are made more dramatic by
               the interplay of the cool luminous
               whitewash and the glossiness and hard
               insistence of the thick, brilliant, full-
               strength enamel.</p>

               Some of the most enticing designs oc-
               cur along the room’s equator, an inch-
               and-a-half wall divider, a strip of paper
               with a flower pattern. Teasingly de-
               ployed with themselves and with the
               border are a potpourri of small articles:
               ceramic mementos, calendars, post
               cards, sentimental homilies and illus-
               trated prayers. A souvenir plate just
               nudges the edge of a door frame, while
               its other side touches a prayer card
               which sits an inch above the patterned
               divider. These small gifts work as
               touchstones to the culture, but their
               minute echoing and alteration, one
               against the other, is endlessly enticing
               to the mind and eye.
               While the Aran women may take
               their work as interior decorators for
               granted, they are proud, byedad!, of
               their sweaters and well aware of the art
               involved in making them. Sculptural
               (with a surface level varying as much as
               an inch), monochromatic and tight-fit-
               ting, these encrusted sweaters are
               meant to be worn in a harsh climate.
               Textures are coarse like the fissured
               and gashed surface of the island. Made
               of wool from which the natural oil has
               not been removed they’re close to
               waterproof. They are so tight that they
               have buttons at the neck so that the
               head can get comfortably through. The
               close fit cuts down the possibilities of
               entanglement and interference, allow-
               ing it to be easily worn under a worker’s
               jacket.
               The patterns are arranged into clear
               representations of the island’s physical
               terrain, with its staggering number of
               stone walls enclosing myriad tiny fields.

               cross the rocky island. Imagine a verti-
               cal row of diamonds enclosing a field of
               seed stitches with a bobble inside each
               of the diamond points, every diamond
               framed on its side by a band of cable
               stitches.
               The sweaters are always a single col-
               or, usually a dark tweedy gray, indigo
               black or subtle browns with moss green
               or maroon casts to them. They possess
               an intriguing tone . . . nutty colors, like
               dark cinnamon or the shells of Brazil
               nuts. The women dress against the
               dourness of the island in bright primary
               colors, floral-print cottons and plaids;
               the men wear the colors of the land-
               scape, brindled gray pants and sweat-
               ers, dark browns and dark blues, which
               harmonize with the stone walls, the
               fields, the sweep of limestone.
               The names of the stitches and pat-
               terns refer to the trade of the men who
               originally wore them: the cable, rope.
               ladder stitch, the herring bone, triple
               sea wave, lobster claw, fish tail. These
               explicit names are different from the
               lyrical ones still used in Scotland, such
               as Sacred Heart, the Rose of Sharon,
               Star of Hope, Crown of Glory. But the
               Aran fisherman’s sweater has its own
               biblical stitch, the Tree of Life. Orig
               inally, the sweaters were made by fish-
               ermen, a rather natural step from mak-
               ing and mending nets, weaving ropes
               and making knots. Now, and for an un-
               determined length of time, the women
               have taken over.
               One of the finest knitters is Una Fla-
               herty, a Bohemian spirit, her clothes
               held on by safety pins, who runs the
               shop in Bongowla, the last village on
               the western tip of the island. In be-
               tween chasing chickens out of the open
               door, receiving a new shipment of
               goods from Galway with high-spirited
               witticisms and sarcastically getting tea
               for her husband Patrick, she knits. She
               has an energetic way with her works in
               progress, dragging them along the floor
               after her as she goes in search of a can
               of peas or couple of candles for a cus-
               tomer. An entertaining talker, she knits
               swiftly while carried away with her
               stories and suddenly throws her work to
               the floor to emphasize a point. Una s
               sweaters are exceptionally rich with in-
               terlaced designs, reminiscent of the pat-
               terning on Celtic stones and crosses.
               Mary Flaherty, mother of nine, knits
               with amazing speed even while walking
               down the road with three of her young-
               est clutching at her skirts. Garrulous
               and multicrafted, these animated wom-
               en live within a contradiction of clutter
               and simple geometry. In the rooms, the
               two most common design elements-
               frames and conscriptive devices which</p>
            <p>
               force the framed items into assemblies.
               groups—give the sense of rootedness,
               enclosure, a life of clear limits, a
               grounded life with few choices. Yet
               there are in both the sweater and kitch-
               en design, contrary effects of intense,
               crowded together activity: the wildest
               puckishness within an economic pin-
               point.
               Kate Conneely’s kitchen was often
               transformed by a heady stream of lan-
               guage from Kate herself, her children
               and her cranky, bragging 87-year-old
               mother. A battery of kettles and pots
               were kept on the stove at all times. Shoe
               repairing, baking, butter churning.
               clothes washing, butchering, saddle
               mending, knitting. Often such activities
               required furniture to be shifted about
               and the room to take on an entirely dif
               ferent character. A heavy clothes wash-
               ing called for the table and chairs to be
               moved out of the way, a massive
               amount of hot water boiled on the
               stove, the big tin tub moved in from the
               fields, sleeves to be rolled up and the
               floor to be doused with sudsy water.
               The long wall in the back of the house
               would be decked with clean wet sheets,
               shirts, underwear, trousers, pinafores,
               and these would have rocks placed on
               top of them so that the newly washed
               clothes would not blow away.
               Two ancient grandmothers are sta-
               tioned statuelike, in territorial posses</p>
            <p>
               sion of their spot in front of the fire,
               The population here, which includes
               animals welcome (dogs) and unwel-
               come (cats and chickens), is trans-
               formed during special occasions: dances
               with four accordionists, four or five
               singers taking turns between jigs, horn-
               pikes, waltzes and polkas. During
               wakes, the corpse is laid out in the side
               bedroom and the kitchen is filled with
               people all night long.
               Given the generations, needs, events
               of an Aran home, art is indeed not a
               central fact. As 1 was leaving, Kate
               said: “Patricia, it’s a pity you re leav-
               ing now, because one of those two old
               ladies at the stove will be going soon.
               We’ll have a great night here, that
               time. The two old women were nod-
               ding in agreement: “Yes, it’s a pity.
               Life’s conditions in the awesome
               stoneyard of Aran don’t leave any ap-
               parent space for the visual arts. Yet,
               the cheapest item, as well as the most
               honored elder, gains presence” by the
               way the women decorate the kitchens
               and design their sweaters. The intense,
               rectilinear use of space creates a fun, a
               garrulity, that is not unlike the famous
               Island talk. Wherever the eye lands,
               there is an elaborate fooling with decor-
               ation, intentional or otherwise.

               Chait Purnima, the full moon. Warm
               spring air drifts through deep disap-
               pearing valleys. It rustles across Kobek
               village and reminds me a month has
               passed since my arrival in this Hima-
               layan hamlet. l’ve been studying econ-
               omy and social change in eastem Nepal
               for almost a year now.
               It was during an earlier visit to do
               anthropological work that 1 first began
               to learn about the Limbu people. Ex-
               ploitation of Limbu land rights by high
               caste Brahmins had been well publi-
               cized, and recently the Limbu had been
               one of the few ethnic groups in the
               country to criticize the government s
               policy regarding minorities. 1 had also
               heard about the economic independ-
               ence and sparkle of Limbu women from
               medics and development officers im
               pressed by their culture, so 1 decided to
               visit the region. It was easy for me to
               include them in a comparative study of
               three different ethnic groups, each one
               living on a main north-south trade
               route artery. I had already surveyed a
               Sherpa community and a village com-
               posed of Newar and Tamang farmers.
               The Limbu are not only a different race
               from the other two, but their rice culti-
               vation and their culture are so different
               that 1 often felt, living among them, 1
               might easily be in North Burma or
               Southeast Asia.
               On my second day in the village, 1
               moved into the house of a fairly pros-
               perous Limbu family and arranged a
               corner for myself in an empty hayloft
               behind the main house. It gave me the
               privacy I needed while allowing me to
               be close to the family. As the weeks
               passed, I found myself spending almost
               all my time around the main house with
               Danamaya and her family.
               The house is one of a cluster of two-
               story farmhouses on a steep hillside.
               Lemon bushes and groves of bamboo
               veil the next house, but we can hear
               neighbors in their courtyards. Those
               familiar sounds blur the boundaries be-
               tween family and neighborhood. The
               dark interiors of these mountain dwell-
               ings are primarily used for cooking, for</p>
            <p>
               sleep and for storage. No one works in-
               side.
               The busy routine of domestic work
               proceeds on the veranda and in clean-
               swept courtyards, fusing imperceptibly
               with social life. It is here that villagers
               stay through the pleasant, dry winter
               months. But now, with the arrival of
               spring, activity shifts from these ver-
               andas to muddy fields on slopes above
               and below the village. Early wheat
               wants cutting, and the patchwork of
               terraces must be softened so that tender
               millet and rice sprouts will take hold.
               At the time of the full moon, how-
               ever, the fields are empty. People are
               freed from agricultural labor for the
               holiday and remain at home feasting
               and visiting. Today, neighbors will
               converge on our veranda. They know
               we plan to make a special Limbu orna-
               ment. Around the straw mat at our
               door will sit the artisans of the village-
               a team of women. All of them can
               weave the Limbu tartan cloth and knot
               straw mats. They are renowned brew-
               ers of beer and spirits. The polishings
               of rice and pressing of oil are but two of
               their many skills in the preparation of
               food.
               1 have invited these women to come
               make a Limbu necklace, a naugiri, so
               called because of its nine (nau) golden
               jewels (giri) set among the mass of
               beads arranged one by one by deft fin-
               gers. Since my arrival in the hills of Ne-
               pal, 1 have encountered a range of
               peasant cultures: robust Sherpa herders
               and farmers, the richest of the high-
               land people; progressive Newar traders
               and shopkeepers, many of whose
               daughters are in school; Rai hill people.
               a large ethnic group, also good farmers;
               Magar villagers who seem impover-
               ished by the standards of other groups
               who are squeezing them out; Brahmin
               and Chetri high caste people, frugal
               and industrious, whose women
               sometimes become ascetics and join
               hermitages near their tropical shrines.
               All of these people wear elegant, home-
               made jewelry. Limbu women, however,
               stand out for their industry, their bold-</p>
            <p>
               ness, their assertiveness and their
               pride. Their chunky naugiri necklace,
               worn day and night, in the fields and at
               weddings, typifies the general status of
               these women; it has become, for me, a
               symbol of their vigor, and one which I
               want to take with me when 1 leave.
               When 1 expressed interest in having
               my own naugiri, Danamaya, my host,
               and her friends were delighted. The
               first question was where to get one for
               me. 1 wouldn’t want an old one bought
               from the bank, my friends assured me.
               Those worn jewels have value only as
               security against land purchase loans. I
               must have a new one, they insisted. But
               new necklaces cannot be purchased.
               l’hey are not produced for a market. A
               Limbu woman obtains her naugiri,
               made especially for her by women in
               her family, at the time of her marriage.
               My surrogate family here in Kobek will
               make mine.
               I committed myself to this scheme
               with the purchase of the basic material
               -a thola (about a half ounce) of pure
               gold costing 500 rupees (850) on the
               Limbu market. I bought this from a vil-
               lager recently returned from military
               service in Malaya. Next, 1 was intro-
               duced to the local goldsmith. His de-
               crepit hut (on the outskirts of the vil-
               lage because of his pariah caste) has a
               second-story veranda. Here he fashions
               jewels with his fingers and toes for the
               constant stream of Limbu customers.
               Over the course of a week 1 watched
               him tap the worthless-looking lump of
               metal 1 had entrusted to him into lus-
               trous, paper-thin yellow sheets. The
               precious metal was finding its beauty in
               his experienced hands. Finally he
               molded and engraved each of the nine
               leaves of gold he had made into indi-
               vidual jewels, knuckly and assertive.
               Between each of these chunks, we
               women will set thousands of glassy
               green beads. 1 bought these at the
               weekly market out of a dazzling array
               of bangles and beads imported from In-
               dia and sold by squatting vendors hud-
               dled in rows, one beside the next, on
               the floor of the market square. I also</p>

               bought red cloth from which to cut the
               furry washers that will be set on both
               sides of the gold. And finally, for the
               rope on which to string all this, we cut
               the yellow nylon cord from my back-
               pack.
               On the morning of Chait Purnima,
               the essentials for our day’s work are
               ready for our guests who will shortly
               converge on our veranda mat. A five-
               gallon pot of kodo (millet beer) sits
               gurgling in the darkness of the house.
               With it are six bottles of raxsi, a clear
               ginlike drink distilled from fermented
               kodo. The beer is not of as fine a qual-
               ity as 1 would have liked—sweet and
               aged for months in cool, sealed pots
               such as 1 have had in the homes of
               other women. Such kodo is not for sale;
               it is for guests and a family’s own enjoy-
               ment. What is sold is coarse and aged
               for only a week. That is all we have to-
               day, prepared by my host Danamaya
               and sold to me for this occasion. Good
               raxsi, customarily made for sale, is
               more readily obtained. Danamaya sold
               me three bottles; another three came
               from a neighbor, glad to have cash be-
               fore market day when she had expected
               to sell this brew, glass by glass, at the
               side of the road.
               1 mention this trade for several rea
               sons. First, it is an essential medium of
               payment for the assembly of women
               who will fashion this necklace. Second,
               Limbu alcohols facilitate warm memor-
               ies of time spent in the households. And
               not least, the sale of liquor is an impor-
               tant source of cash, the main means of
               women’s marketing experience. Ex-
               clusive brewers of this much appreci
               ated product, these women (like other
               hill women throughout Nepal) refine
               their skills and compete for the cash
               rewards.
               Nowadays, much of the cash a per-
               son accumulates is invested in new
               fields and farming equipment. Never-
               theless, jewelry retains its high value
               and status. Women have a right to jew-
               elry from a very young age. This right
               comes through their family member-
               ship and their economic contribution to
               the household. A nose ring is a girl’s
               first acquisition; she may be no more
               than ten years old when she gets the
               first band. Later, year by year, twirls of
               gold are added to it, sometimes from
               her own earnings, since children are
               given goats to raise and can keep the
               profits from their sale. So by the time
               she is 18, a Limbu girl may have earned
               enough to purchase her first gold ear-
               rings. But the naugiri is a different
               matter. It is acquired with womanhood
               and marriage, a gift from her family at
               the time of her betrothal.
               Five women from our house initiate
               the day’s work. Danamaya takes
               charge from the outset by anchoring the
               nylon rope. She must have done this
               many times before. She rubs the loose
               end of the rope in her palm and patient-
               ly separates its single strands. Forty</p>
            <p>
               five individual threads fan out in front
               of her from her toe, which anchors the
               knotted end. Each of us takes a single
               strand, then sits around Danamaya.
               We become a human loom fastened to-
               gether by the strings from her toe. Thus
               situated, Danamaya coordinates the
               entire enterprise. She takes each bead-
               ed string as it is filled and hands us an
               empty thread in exchange.
               Such a pivotal role is not new for this
               sober woman who manages our entire
               household. No one appears to object to
               her leadership, a situation which strikes
               me as strange since Danamaya does not
               permanently reside here. It is true this
               is her natal house. But Danamaya gave
               up certain rights when she married and
               took her dowry with her to another vil-
               lage. This house is now her-maitighar
               (maternal house) and Danamaya is a
               visitor along with her baby girl, Deepa.
               In Limbu culture, it is not uncommon
               for women to bring their children to live
               for months in their maitighar while
               their young husbands go off to seek
               work in the Indian and British Gurkha
               forces. Danamaya has decided to do
               this while her husband is away in the
               army. 1 don’t know what he and her
               mother-in-law think of it, but her own
               family is much gratified by Dana-
               maya s long visit.
               We begin to string beads after our
               morning meal. Soon Danamaya s
               neighborhood friend, Lakshmi, joins
               our circle, grasps a nylon thread and
               becomes part of our loom. She holds
               the thread taut and quietly feeds on the
               little green bits, one by one. Lakshmi is
               also visiting her maitighar in Kobek.
               But unlike Danamaya, she does not in-
               tend to return to her marriage house.
               She had remained there, she told me,
               only until her baby was born. The in-
               fant is here with her, and she has no in-
               tention of rejoining her husband, be-
               cause, she says, she doesn t like him.
               As long as she is welcome in her
               maitighar, a Limbu woman in this
               situation can divorce her husband. She
               may also remarry. This is not Lak-
               shmi’s concern at the moment. She has
               joined us in our full moon project, a
               group of women, each clutching a
               string on this human loom, eyes fixed
               on specks of green glass.
               There is no relief. When one string is
               completed and conversation dwells on
               the tedious operation confronting us,
               Danamaya interrupts our dawdling.
               That’s enough, she orders. “Here,
               give it to me. And she hands us an
               empty string.
               An hour passes. Finally Danamaya’s
               left hand holds only a few bare threads.
               In her other are the rest, threaded with
               several inches of beads. We rush to
               complete the remaining strands. With
               all threads beaded, we can now fit on
               the first knob of gold. First a cloth
               washer of bright red is fed onto the
               clump of threads, drawn together to
               squeeze through. We sit back, de-</p>

               lighted as the golden knob shimmers its
               way down the cord. Another disc of red
               cloth fixes the gold in place. This is our
               signal to reassemble around Dana-
               maya. She resumes her anchoring posi-
               tion and again separates the threads,
               allocating one at a time to each of us.
               We bend over our beadwork again.
               The second section of the necklace
               seems to take far less time to complete.
               There are seven of us and we have es-
               tablished a pace independent of any in-
               structions. Soon the 45 threads are
               equally full of green beads. Once again,
               we relax while Danamaya tightens
               them together and pulls on the red
               washer, then the golden giri and
               another band of red cloth. By now the
               pattern of the necklace is apparent.
               Sparkling glass beads, tiny and bright
               green, then a red flash, the soft luster of
               gold, red flash, a block of twinkling
               green, red, another gold knob, red
               again. Time for respite.
               The first to move off our communal
               mat is Ama, who disappears into the
               darkness of the empty house to the
               waiting hearth. She starts a fire from
               red-hot coals nestled under ash. And
               alone, she eases the pot of kodo onto
               the rock grill. In seconds it is warm and
               waiting for us. There is no invitation;
               we simply rise and move inside, gather-
               ing around the hearth. Danamaya
               takes a ladle and stirs the brew, ready
               to scoop out the steaming liquor.
               In front of each of us Mylie sets a
               small dish with a spoonful of black
               spice. This is the pickle, achar, a sharp
               lemony condiment which all Nepalis
               enjoy with their alcohol. Next, we are
               served a larger brass bowl with the
               brew Danamaya has poured out. Some
               of us drink this kodo; others take small
               goblets of raxsi, also warmed to taste.
               This is Mylie, the only unmarried woman in our
               household. The author had wanted to employ her
               as a research assistant, but the family wouldn’t
               agree, since it would mean the loss of its most val-
               uable worker.</p>

               This woman, a widow, no longer wears the
               naugiri, but she is very fond of her modernistic
               silver ring which, she says, is an old design made
               of very old metal. Silver is no longer valued as
               adornment among these peasants.
               1 remark.
               l’m surprised,
               friend, Monomaya is not yet here. She
               told me she would certainly help with
               my naugiri.
               She’ll be here, murmurs Dana-
               maya, as soon as raxsi is ready.
               Hardly have we spoken than into the
               darkness struts Monamaya. Her face is
               that of a timid Oriental peasant, but
               her bearing resembles that of a blust-
               erer. She cheerfully notes our leisure
               and sits down among us as Ama serves
               her an immodest portion of raxsi. “Ah,
               so you re going to have your own Lim-
               bu jewlery, eh, eh?” says Monamaya
               reaching over to take my cigarette. She
               lights one for herself from the smold-
               ering tip. “A sheep got loose and my
               sisters and 1 spent the whole morning
               chasing it home, complains the grin-
               ning latecomer. Everyone takes a
               drink.
               People speak little about Monamaya
               in my presence. They know she and 1
               have become good friends since my ar-
               rival in the village and they respect that
               friendship. It is true Monamaya is a
               social oddity. She doesn’t like to work
               in the fields, an aversion which in this
               rural community is interpreted as irre-
               sponsibility and laziness. Monamaya is
               also the only unmarried woman l’ve
               met here. And she s the only villager
               who walks alone like me on the three-
               day trek to the nearest town. 1 was
               never able to discover the reason for my
               friend’s unpopularity; I continued to
               like her raucous manner.
               When we have drunk our fill, we all
               return to the veranda and remain there
               the rest of the afternoon, until all the
               beading is complete. Monamaya joins
               in and like the other workers she shows
               no incapacity from the bowls of Limbu</p>
            <p>
               alcohol we have just consumed around
               the fire. “Kodo and raxsi are nourish-
               ment for us, explains Monomaya.
               Without it, we can’t work; and when
               we take it, we don’t need any other
               food.
               Our work force is now supplemented
               by two elderly women of Salaka lineage
               and therefore clanswomen of my hosts.
               One of these is Buddhamaya, a tall,
               dry-witted lady with aristocratic
               features that glare from her heavily
               wrinkled face. We make some space on
               the mat and Danamaya hands her one
               of the nylon threads. “Who is this for?
               White Didi here, nodding at me.
               (Didi is a widely used Nepali title em-
               ployed as a term of respect for young
               women, both strangers and friends.)
               Buddhamaya continues. “Why do
               vou want this? It is for poor farmers.
               You should have solid gold pieces, here
               here . . . here, stroking me and
               indicating how the gold might encase
               my head and arms like some Aztec-
               Limbu warrior-princess. Even the
               thought itself is an encumbrance.
               No, no, Monamaya earnestly re-
               plies. “White Didi is going to wear this
               to the Chatrapeti festival next week,
               and then she’Il take it with her back to
               America. Everyone there will admire it.
               And Didi will tell the Americans about
               our poor land.
               1 am silent, having already passed
               many hours fruitlessly arguing with
               these and other Nepal hill people about
               the importance of their artistic tradi-
               tions. 1 have not succeeded in convinc-
               ing them that an important distinction
               exists between our admiration and our
               curiosity. They insist my interest is only
               curiosity, and this naugiri will be pre-
               sented as a curio to evoke discussion of
               their culture, which will dwell on econ-
               omics they believe we must interpret as
               poverty.
               I myself have always found it diffi-
               cult to understand how these humble
               farmers can afford such jewelry. A nau-
               giri is the price of a good plowing bul-
               lock, and while every woman wears a</p>
            <p>
               naugiri, less than ten percent of house-
               holds possess a pair of oxen. This is
               not, however, a case of naive peasants
               investing only in precious objects. As I
               have said, land is high-priced and peo-
               ple work and save to buy and develop
               new fields. The value of a naugiri is
               hard to fix. Certainly one should not
               compare the cost of a naugiri with that
               of an ox. The naugiri is an obligatory
               expense for every family, like wedding
               feasts when each daughter marries. It is
               an integral part of family social and ec-
               onomic obligations.
               Most Limbus are unable to say why
               they value the naugiri so highly. To
               them its meaning is a whole set of sent-
               iments, deeply implanted, that 1 cannot
               possibly understand, let alone share. It
               is not my dowry. It does not mark my
               marital status. Nor is it my personal in-
               dulgence in ornaments because, as they
               have already noted with some dismay, 1
               don't wear earrings, bangles or
               baubles. Nevertheless, they do want me
               to take this piece of jewelry with me
               when 1 leave. Curio or art, my Limbu
               friends feel it is their gift to me, some-
               thing that symbolizes our bond and the
               cooperative spirit from our months to-
               gether.
               want the naugiri because it has
               come to symbolize for me the vigor of
               Limbu womanhood. I like its coarse,
               knuckly shape and its dull gold luster.
               But 1 also see it as a beautiful object, a
               true piece of art which in any circum-
               stance, in any culture, retains its beau-
               ty. It is this beauty that I admire. It is
               in this respect that we discover a value
               the Limbus and 1 do not share. To
               them, this naugiri, while it is a well-
               made object, is not particularly beauti-
               ful. For them, an ornament’s beauty is
               a direct function of its weight in gold.
               This is a basic difference in our values.
               And it is because of this that my inter-
               est is seen as curiosity and not admir-
               ation. This is probably the reason why
               these people may eventually allow the
               naugiri or a simpler imitation of it to be
               produced for sale in the marketplace.</p>

               The gold disc earrings and naugiri were borrowed for this portrait since
               the older women had passed theirs on to their married daughters while the
               two young women, not yet married, were still to win theirs.

               The Equivocal Role
               o1 Women Artists in
               Von-Literate Cultures</p>
            <p>
               Jehanne H. Teilhet</p>
            <p>
               xamine the claim: nonliterate art is
               a system of communication which man-
               ifests the ideologies and beliefs that
               bring order and definition to a person’s
               culture. This statement seems fine, but
               who makes these art forms and whose
               view does the culture indeed reflect?
               have come to realize that the arts, the
               hieratic arts in particular, reflect male
               behavior and opinion, for it is men who
               dominate the “important” arts. Wom-
               en artists (and their art forms) play a
               more equivocal cultural role because
               they cannot work in certain materials
               or use specialized tools or technology
               and, in many cultures, cannot make
               figurative images.1 But we shall neither
               analyze nor interpret the role of the
               woman artist in nonliterate cultures un-
               til we have examined the role of the
               male artist.
               Most of the documentation of nonlit-
               erate art assumes that only a man can
               be an artist. This man, depending on
               the cultural area, must possess talent,
               skill, intelligence and, on occasion.
               genealogical rights of privilege. Polyne-
               sia has a distinct class of professional
               artists to which one can belong only if
               one is born male and has the appropri-
               ate lineage and natural talent.? In Mel-
               anesia talent and competitive skill rath-
               er than genealogy are the requisites for
               the coveted position of artist, but it is
               still only the male who qualifies.? The
               men often serve an apprenticeship since
               the ritual meaning and knowledge of
               the objects they make are as important
               as learning the essential skills and exer-
               cising the necessary talent. In contrast
               to Oceanic cultures, in the Arctic it is
               generally believed that all male adults
               are able to make art. As Edmund Car-
               penter comments: “carving is a normal,
               essential skill (for the Eskimo), just as</p>
            <p>
               writing is with us.”4 In Africa the posi-
               tion and training of the male artist
               ranges between the extremes of Poly
               nesia and the Arctic.
               Though the social status of the male
               artist varies in these societies, as do
               their artistic skill and training, the
               women have uniformly limited access
               to the art arena. Even in societies such
               as that of Polynesia, where they have
               political and economic importance,
               women work in “barkcloth and weav
               ing, but the important hard-media
               crafts Jare the preserve of men.
               Melanesia, where the political and ec-
               onomic power lie mainly in the hands of
               the “Big Men, women work in pottery
               and weaving. In many African cul-
               tures, the Yoruba of Nigeria for exam
               ple, women can achieve political and/
               or economic importance and are not en
               tirely excluded from ritual, yet
               women do the spinning, dyeing, mat-
               ting, and the potting; and the remaind
               er of the crafts are practiced by men.
               Douglas Fraser points out that
               primitive man, though he may not
               have a word for art
               almost always
               differentiates between objects produced
               by a slow, repetitive
               process, such as
               weaving or pottery (craf
               and other
               objects of paramount significance for
               his culture. He relegates craft work to
               inferiors (i.e., women); only men, as a
               rule, practiced carving and painting.
               Fraser’s observation is accurate, but
               Andrew Whiteford, in response to
               Fraser, raises the question of whether
               the crafts made by women can be con-
               sidered, from a Western perspective,
               any less an art form than the art
               made by men. In reference to American
               Indian cultures, Whiteford writes:
               That one type of painting is realistic,
               religious, and male-produced, while the</p>
            <p>
               other is geometric, secular—although it
               may have religious connotations we do
               not know about—and female-produced
               does not suffice to put them in different
               categories. If we insist upon separating
               them, we are led to the disparaging
               conclusion that Indian men created
               sacred art: women only manufactured
               mundane crafts.?
               Our aesthetic and cognitive response
               to these art forms made by women is of-
               ten different from the response in the
               cultures that produced them. We may
               indeed designate many of the objects
               made by women as art.” But we must
               realize that we differentiate between
               art and craft” in terms of ideas of
               "“creativity” and “signif-
               innovation,
               icant form; by strict Western defini-
               tion most nonliterate arts would then
               fall into the category of craft. This dis-
               tinction between art and craft by West-
               ern standards is thus an arbitrary one
               when applied out of context to nonliter-
               ate art: women artists are neither more
               nor less innovative and creative within
               the media they use than are men artists
               The specific difference between the art-
               ist and non-artist seems to be one of de-
               gree. This is more obvious in a non-lit-
               erate, or so-called primitive society,
               than in our own. In pre-European Ha-
               waii, for example, nearly all women
               made bark cloth called kapa (tapa),
               decorating it with highly creative de-
               signs. In a broad sense most of these
               women were artists, some better than
               others, for some examples of tapa dis-
               play more intuitive inventiveness and
               mastery of technique than others.
               Many nonliterate cultures distin-
               guish between what might be called

               the author a tapa cloth she has just finished. The
               bark cloth is used in their homes as room dividers
               and decoration, and they also give tapa-cloth gifts
               to people building new homes, as a kind of house-

               some cases, by a finer quality of work--
               manship. For example, in the Mar-
               quesas, a serving bowl not made by a
               male artist with deep knowledge of
               magic and ritual would be just a bowl
               because it had not been properly initi-
               ated into the Universe.1° Both men and
               women produce secular objects, but in
               most cultures it is the expert male artist
               who usually works on the culturally de
               termined, more important art ob-
               jects. (We must remember that it was
               the Western world—mainly via male
               anthropologists and art historians-
               that introduced the concept of “art to
               nonliterate cultures, and determined
               what would qualify as art, with until
               recently, little corroboration from the
               indigenous people themselves.) The
               issue here, however, is not whether we
               accept the objects produced by women
               as art, but why most women were
               and are traditionally denied access to
               the specialized role of artist as creator
               of religio-political objects. The relevant
               factor is that however art is defined, all
               nonliterate cultures distinguish be-
               tween the art produced by men and
               that produced by women; and this is
               our concern here.
               The disparities of style, technique
               and media between men and women
               artists appear to be universal. In most
               cultures women are rarely allowed to
               make anthropomorphic or zoomorphic
               forms; these are the prerogative of men.
               In most cultures women are rarely per-
               mitted to make objects requiring the
               knowledge of ritual process or the skill
               and knowledge of manipulating certain
               specialized tools. And there seems to be
               a universal taboo against women s</p>

               sculpting in hard materials such
               wood, bone, ivory, stone, gold and
               metal compounds; these materials are
               used exclusively by men.1 Women can
               work only with soft, malleable materi-
               als: clay, gourds, basketry, leather or
               weaving. We can therefore say that a
               distinction exists (in traditional nonlit-
               erate societies) between the arts made
               by men and women.
               Franz Boas has commented that the
               stylistic differences he observed in an
               Eskimo community arose both from
               differences in the technical processes
               and (even more) from the fact that men
               do the realistic work and women the
               clothing and sewn leather work.12 Wil-
               liam Bascom pursues Boas’s notion
               that a sexual division of labor must also
               be considered in regard to stylistic dif-
               ferences:
               In painting, for example, there are
               marked contrasts between the represen-
               tational designs of men and the geomet-
               ric patterns of women among the
               American Indians of the Plains and the
               Great Basin; and the same is true in
               bead-working. Among the Ashanti and
               the peoples of the Cameroun grass-
               lands, the anthropomorphic pottery
               pipes made by men contrast sharply
               with the pottery produced by women.1
               He has also noted that artists divided
               within a society by sex and/or craft
               may develop distinct styles, just as iso-
               lated subtribes do. Both Boas and
               Bascom address the broad issue of dis-
               tinct styles within one society, and each
               notes that when the men and the wom-
               en work in the same medium their
               products are markedly distinguishable.
               Robert Rattray, working among the
               Ashanti of Ghana, also notes this dis-
               tinction: “Men do not fashion pots or
               pipes unless they represent anthropo-
               morphic or zoomorphic forms, for
               women are forbidden to make these.
               Such a distinction is also observed
               among American Indians: Whiteford
               found that women’s art, excluding
               tourist art, rarely portrayed animal and
               human forms.16 The media shared by
               men and women are also distinguished
               by technique or process. For example,
               Yoruba men and women both weave.
               The men use a horizontal, narrow band
               loom. The women, however, use a ver-
               tical cotton loom. Men may have
               adopted the horizontal loom because it
               can produce an endless strip of cloth,
               thereby relegating the more restrictive
               or “inferior process of the vertica
               loom for the women.18 Roslyn Walker,
               however, suggests that the women s'use
               of the vertical loom is a practical
               distinction, since the vertical loom is
               not placed against the abdomen and al-</p>

               aving dur-
               ing pregnancy.”19 Her argument is not
               compelling since women are only preg-
               nant for a few years of their working
               Anthropomorphic and zoomorphic
               forms are usually reserved for the more
               important or sacred religio-political
               representations of deities, ancestors
               and benevolent and malèvolent spirits
               or divine personages. One might con-
               clude that women are restricted from
               making these forms because of their
               powerful association with the superna-
               tural. But, among the Anang of Nigeria
               and other societies, human and animal
               figurines are used as house decorations
               and toys.2° Since these figures are pure-
               ly secular, we might question why
               women are not allowed to make them.
               Women cannot make them because
               they are carved in wood; they would
               probably be allowed to make a rudi-
               mentary toy figure in clay. But as wom-
               en do not generally make these images
               they would not necessarily be able to
               make even a clay figure, so it is not
               surprising to discover that women do
               not try. In the final analysis, one must
               conclude that anthropomorphic and
               zoomorphic forms are of such para-
               mount importance that making them is
               a privilege given almost exclusively to
               men.21 There are exceptions to this re-
               striction: certamn women have extra-
               ordinary talents and skills not unlike a
               shaman, for which particular societies
               make allowances. 1 will return to this
               point later.
               Certain oral traditions relate how
               women once made anthropomorphic
               images. One such story is reported by
               Rattray. The Ashanti people told him
               about a potter, Denta, who became
               barren because she modeled “figure
               pots. Thereafter, according to the
               Ashanti, women did not make highly
               ornamented pottery.22 Rattray was also
               told that women were forbidden to
               make anthropomorphic forms because
               they required greater skill.23 (In con-
               nection with the grave punishment of
               becoming barren, Ashanti women are
               forewarned that they do not have the
               greater skill, which implies the skill of
               ritual knowledge.) Little literature is
               available relating specifically to the
               prohibition against women s making
               anthropomorphic or zoomorphic forms,
               but of the accounts that 1 know, women
               who initiated the making of such im-
               ages were either killed, sworn to secrecy
               or made barren.2 That some women
               initially created figurines may relate to
               their innate role as natural creator of
               anthropomorphic forms. Adrian Ger-

               that the woodcarver, the maker of
               wooden images, has a special place in
               the Asmat society. Just as a new human
               being develops in the body of a woman,
               so does wood come to life in his hand.
               His creativity, however, belongs to
               another sphere. From the woman
               comes the life of this world, whereas he
               creates supernatural life.”25 One might
               also argue that women, as creators of
               human beings, had no subliminal need
               to create anthropomorphic representa-
               tions. But if that were the case, men
               would not have thought it necessary to
               restrict the women’s imagery.2 One
               could surmise that women, with their
               innate powers to give birth in the real
               world, were already too powerful and
               to balance that power men took as their
               prerogative the right to create super
               natural life in the forms of anthropo-
               morphic and zoomorphic images.
               Some women, mentioned above, are
               allowed to make anthropomorphic and
               zoomorphic forms in soft materials
               such as clay. A survey showing the cul-
               tural distribution of these women has
               not been compiled. Women in Melane-
               sia (i.e., Wusi, New Hebrides, and the
               Chambri lakes district of New Guinea
               and Africa make figurative images in
               terra cotta. Robert Thompson, in his
               article “Abatan: A Master Potter of the
               Egbado Yoruba, gives us an excellent
               portrait of a woman artist. Both Aba-
               tan’s mother and maternal grandmoth-
               er were potters. Unlike male artists, she
               had no formal training. She learned her
               technique and inspiration from the con-
               stant observation of her mother.
               Abatan is known for her figurative
               vessels (awo ota eyinle), a vessel for the
               stones of Eyinle, a Yoruba god with
               an amazing synthesis of powers of the</p>
            <p>
               hunt, herbalism, and water.
               Abatan’s parents believed that she
               came into the world through the grace
               of Eyinle. Accordingly, as an invoca-
               tion, she received the name of the deity
               before his transformation, Abatan...
               As the senior member of the cult of
               Oshun and Eyinle at Oke-Odan,
               Abatan lives a life of prestige, balanced
               "28 Thomp-
               just short of hauteur. . ..
               son stresses the fact that Abatan is a
               women artist of stature among the Eg-
               bado Yoruba. She is not an ordinary
               woman, she has religio-political and ec-
               onomic status. But had she not been
               born the daughter of a potter and not
               come into the world through the grace
               of Eyinle and not been talented, she
               would not have had the opportunity to
               make figurative pots and accrue status.
               This safeguards the making of figura-
               tive images from incursion by just any
               woman.
               Among the Plain Longuda of Niger-
               ia, certain women are allowed to make
               anthropomorphic and zoomorphic pots
               for the Kwandlha cult.29 The master of
               Kwandlha must be an artist as well as a
               healer, for the spirits of diseases will
               not take up their abode in poorly ex-
               ecuted Kwandlha vessels. Dasumi, of
               the village of Guyuk, is respected for
               her knowledge and skill in making the
               Kwandlha pots. She is woman past
               child-bearing years, and unlike
               Abatan, she did not inherit her posi-
               tion. In the early 1960s Dasumi was
               plagued with a series of illnesses; she
               went to Moudo, an elderly woman liv
               ing nearby, to be cured. Moudo told
               Dasumi that the Kwandlha were wor-
               rying her, they were calling her to be
               come a member of the cult. Dasumi ap-
               prenticed with Moudo for about two
               years before she became a master of the
               Kwandlha.
               Dasumi specializes in children’s dis-
               eases; when a child is sick, the mother
               will consult Dasumi. She examines the
               child and then takes one of her diagnos-
               tic Kwandlha pots from their own spe-
               cial hut (tanda Kwandlha). If the par-
               ticular Kwandlha stays submerged in a
               basin of water, then her diagnosis is
               correct; if not, she will take another
               Kwandlha and repeat this process until
               one stays submerged. The child is given
               some medicine and the mother gives
               Dasumi some of the special red clay re-
               quired to fashion a Kwandlha. Dasumi
               will touch the child’s body with the red
               clay, beseeching the spirit of the disease
               to leave the child and acknowledge that
               she will be making an abode for it. In
               seclusion Dasumi will create, with the
               coil and mold method, a Kwandlha pot
               that personifies that disease. Gurgu-</p>

               gives it to the mother to sun dry for four
               days before firing. Once fired, Dasumi
               returns to begin the ritualized process
               of calling the spirit of the disease to
               leave the child and enter the Kwandl-
               ha; this entails a special Kwandlha
               language, the sacrifice of a chicken or
               goat and a special drink called Sinke
               contained in a special terra-cotta urn,
               Suthala. Dasumi is paid in kind or coin
               for her work.
               Though Dasumi works within an
               iconographic tradition, she is allowed
               to introduce new elements as long as it
               pleases the spirits. She was, when 1
               interviewed her in 1968, more famous
               than Moudo, her teacher. My infor-
               mant, Elam Robaino, attributed this to
               her artistic skills as a maker of Kwandl-
               ha pots. The spirits of the diseases are
               pleased with her pots; they like their
               abodes.
               I asked Dasumi if men made
               Kwandlha pots; she replied that a man
               in Purokayo village, some four miles
               from Guyak, makes small ones for chil-
               dren. There is also an old man in Kuryi
               village who makes Kwandlha from
               wood, but it takes him much time to do
               it. She added that her grandson, who
               was three, seemed to have a calling for
               the Kwandlha; her daughters were not
               called to the profession. 30
               Both Dasumi and Abatan were
               called to their particular cults and both
               proved to have the necessary artistic
               skills to make figurative vessels; one
               inherited the profession, the other ap-
               prenticed. Of equal importance is the
               fact that their own society made allow-
               ances for women of unusual talent to
               enter the male domain of the figurative
               arts.
               Lacking sufficient data from other
               societies, one can only conjecture that
               the tradition of making figurative im-
               agery is open, in certain societies, only
               to exceptional women—women who
               cross the boundary between the sacred
               and profane.
               More universal in its application is
               the taboo against women s working
               with hard materials and certain special-
               ized tools. Although terra-cotta in
               comparison with wood is a relatively
               permanent medium, the women work</p>
            <pb facs="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BucknellDSC/heresies/main/issue04/images/Heresies_04_102.jpg" n="102" xml:id="img_0102"/>
            <p>
               this medium when it is soft and malle
               able. That it is transformed when fired
               into a relatively hard and durable sub
               stance does not appear to be an issue.
               The hard materials used as a primary
               medium by male artists are usually rat-
               ed in most nonliterate cultures accord-
               ing to their relative importance. The
               scale of relative importance, power or
               sanctity of the medium varies from cul-
               ture to culture, but the culturally de-
               fined criterion is generally determined
               by the material’s durability, scarcity,
               the skill and/or technology necessary to
               work it and the medium s'innate magi-
               co-religious properties. As a general
               rule, the more important materials are
               reserved for the more important deities
               or supernatural forces. Among the Yor-
               uba, wood is rarely employed to repre-
               sent the gods because of its perishable
               nature. Wood is used, however, for vo-
               tive sculpture representing priests or
               devotees.32 To the Asmat, who live in
               an alluvial mudflat that lacks stone or
               metal ores, wood becomes the impor-
               tant medium. Wood is so important in
               this culture that man and tree are re-
               garded as interchangeable concepts:
               the human being is a tree and the tree is
               a human being.33 That wood is a mor-
               tal” living substance can enhance its
               value as a symbolic referent, as intimat
               ed by the Asmat man/tree equivalent.
               In cultures that have a variety of
               materials to choose from, one also
               finds, as with the Yoruba, that the mor-
               tal-decaying aspect of wood relegates
               its use to the more human realms asso-
               ciated with ancestor spirits, culture he-
               roes and demigods, as well as priests
               and devotees. Because of its accessibil
               ity and the varying skills of adeptness
               cessary to carve it, wood is a populai
               medium in nonliterate cultures.
               Stone is valued for its durability, its
               magical origin and the skill necessary to
               carve it. Many nonliterate cultures
               have access to stone, but few utilize its
               potential (as sculpture in the round in
               contrast to petroglyphs)—possibly be
               cause they lack the tools and necessary
               knowledge to carve it. Polynesians
               knew how to work stone (volcanic tuff),
               but none achieved the monumental
               scale of the Moai on Easter Island.
               African artists worked in stone, but few
               if any today carry on the tradition of
               their forefathers.
               Where stone is worked extensively,
               the stone (like wood) is graded in im
               portance. To the Canadian Eskimos.
               for example, hardness is more impor-
               tant than color or shininess; only the
               weaker and less competent Eskimos
               carve soft stone which is “jokingly re
               ferred to as ’women’s stone.</p>
            <p>
               The hard, white ivory of the walrus
               tusk is still the Eskimos’ favorite mater-
               ial.35 “The desire to use ivory as an ad-
               junct to stone carving is powerful in
               nearly all areas, whatever the nature of
               "36 As Nelson Graburn
               the local stone.
               explains, the ivory is desired for its
               maleness. The forward thrust of the na-
               tural form is associated with male as-
               sertion.”7 It should be noted that with
               the introduction of the tourist market,
               women have been encouraged to carve.
               But the women only carve occasionally
               and “they do not seem to have im-
               pressed their values on the activity.”38
               Whale ivory was also valued in Poly-
               nesia; in Hawaii the whale ivory (lei
               niho pałaoa) necklace was tapu to all
               except the chief (alii). In Melanesia
               pigs tusks are highly valued as are ele-
               phants tusks in Africa. In former
               times, elephant ivory could only be pos-
               sessed and used by the divine chief
               (Oba) of Benin, Nigeria. In addition to
               the given, man-defining metaphor of
               that particular ivory-bearing animal or
               mammal, the form, color and density of
               the ivory enhances its symbolic refer
               ence to the male genitalia. Ivory
               carved or in its natural state, always
               signals important religio-political con
               cepts. Bone, human or otherwise, is al-
               so an intrinsic carrier of religio-political
               concepts.
               Metals, because of their permanence
               and technical manufacture, are an es-
               teemed material. Though the cultures
               of Oceania did not manufacture metals,
               they were quick to trade with Euro-
               peans for this desirous material.
               Among the Gola of Liberia,“the skill of
               working with metals was considered
               one of the most mysterious and remark-
               able forms of knowledge in the tradi-
               tional culture.”32 The traditional
               bronze or brass casters and the black-
               smiths of Africa are often distinguished
               in that the former are creators of “art
               objects and the latter creators of secular
               objects, such as tools and weapons.
               Both can, however, create art forms;
               both belong to a separate caste, guild or
               disjunctive social group signaling that
               both have mysterious powers” in con-
               nection with the process of manufactur-
               ing metals. That the working of metals
               is a male prerogative also refers to the
               use of metal objects in war and hunt-
               ing. Precious metals such as gold and
               silver reflect the splendor and panoply
               of the conjoined realms of man and
               god.
               The above is not an exhaustive sur-
               vey of hard materials, but it gives a
               summary view of the values and ideol-
               ogies men have attributed to certain
               materials. In short, it seems that men</p>

               have come to identify their maleness
               with materials they have explicitly or
               implicitly chosen as their exclusive pre-
               rogative. Women work in soft materials
               that “best reflect their femaleness. In
               comparison with hard materials, these
               are generally less enduring, fragile,
               more pliable, secondary or subservient,
               common and secularly oriented to
               women s work: i.e., the home, garden.
               cooking and childraising. Originally
               there may have been little or no status
               differentiation between the media; that
               is, the men’s materials were not neces-
               sarily better than the women’s mater-
               ials, until a conscious effort was made
               to give certain materials qualities of
               status and importance. It is plausible
               that women initially had less leisure
               time than men did and therefore turned
               their creative talents toward the mater-
               ials close at hand to make the objects
               necessary for domestic life, without
               identifying with the material. But as
               sex roles became more defined, the art-
               making habits developed into political
               moves, and the material that the men
               initially worked in was given an imag-
               inary power to justify male seizure of
               power and status over women. I believe
               the values and ideologies attributed to
               certain materials were a male invention
               to keep women in their place because 1
               find it curious that women did not
               choose to explore the use of different
               media once the society became more
               settled. Evidence in fact indicates that
               women must have tried to work in other
               materials, otherwise there would not be
               so many tapus against women achiev-
               ing this goal.“
               In traditional cultures men have con-
               trolled women s'use of materials by not

               to work hard materials. In many non-
               literate cultures the artist’s tools are
               somewhat animistic; they are thought
               to possess intelligence, given their own
               family names, and in some areas, such
               as Polynesia, their own genealogy.
               Tools can accrue prestige, power and
               sanctity, for it is the conscious, con-
               joined effort of tools and men that
               create carvings. Carving is a religious
               act; among the Ashanti and other Afri-
               can societies, sacrifices and prayers
               were made to the tools to ask them for
               their assistance and freedom from acci-
               dents.“ In Hawaii the artist “conse
               crated his tools by a sacrifice and a
               chant to insure that sufficient mana
               was contained in them, consequently
               insuring the efficacy of the image, ’the
               house of the god.””42 By ritualizing the
               artist’s tools, women were barred from
               using them because, as sources of pollu
               tion, women would nullify the tools’ ef-
               ficacy. Women were also handicapped
               in that they could not work in the harc
               materials necessary to make their own
               tools. By restricting women from using
               specialized artistry, tools or technology,
               men have safeguarded hard materials
               for their own use. Many scholars have
               commented on the fact that “the act of
               carving should exhibit those qualities
               central to the male hunting and sex
               role.”43 Tools and technology in the
               hands of women would cause an imbal-
               ance in the equipose of sexual labor.
               In addition, a certain cosmology of-
               ten clearly ordains the privilege of carv-
               ing to men. In the Anang society we are
               told that women do not carve because
               the Creator God, Abassi, “wills it and
               has instructed the fate spirit not to as-
               sign the craft to a female.”4 In New
               Ireland there is a legend that the first
               100</p>
            <p>
               woodcarver learned his craft from a
               ghost. The woodcarver instructed stu
               dents who then became famous artists
               Women were not only excluded from
               art and ritual, they could not even see
               the objects or use the sacred word for
               them, alik or uli, on threat of being
               choked to death by men.“
               For the “important arts” men have
               developed an elaborate process of man-
               ufacture regulated by a prescribed set
               of rituals. The special, prescribed ac-
               tions, repeated over and over again,
               lend continuity and stability to the rit-
               ual. These formal actions, sanctioned
               by religion, are thought to have an eso-
               teric importance which is only fully
               comprehensible to the initiated male
               artists. Rituals have many levels of sig
               nificance, but it is possible that the
               ritualization of the art process devel-
               oped, in part, as a further precaution to
               prevent women from entering this do-
               main. Women have rituals of their own
               and in some cases are allowed to join
               the men’s rituals, but women do not
               have a prescribed set of ritualized ac-
               tions in the creation of their arts. Even
               though Abatan and Dasumi worked in
               the realm of the supernatural, made
               figurative images, and, in the case of
               Dasumi, used a special red clay, thein
               artistic processes were not ritualized
               This signifies that women’s artistry
               deals with the more profane real time
               and space.
               The ritualized making process has
               many variants among nonliterate cul-
               tures, but the majority, if not all, share
               the belief that women are sources of
               pollution. Strict precautions must
               therefore be taken to exclude women
               from these ritualized activities. In Poly

               to whom dangerous spirits were likel
               to attach themselves, and who were at
               times in a contaminated state psychi-
               cally; and with sickness and death
               which were the signs of the presence of

               present (in varying degrees) in other
               nonliterate cultures, and an important
               aspect of the ritualized artistic process
               is to purify and protect the male artist
               from malevolent forces, which include
               women. In all nonliterate cultures the
               most dangerous form of pollution is
               connected with menstrual blood. Men-
               strual blood was regarded among the
               Maoris of New Zealand as a human be-
               ing manqué.“ The Mbum and Jukun
               of Nigeria segregated menstruous
               women because the household gods
               found the menstrual blood abhorrent."
               An Ashanti “woman might not carve a
               stool—because of the ban against men-
               struation. A woman in this state was
               formerly not even allowed to approach
               wood-carvers while at work, on pain of
               death or of a heavy fine. This fine was
               to pay for sacrifices to be made upon
               the ancestral stools of dead kings, and
               also upon the wood-carver’s tools.
               Rattray believes that the abhorrence of
               the unclean woman “is based on the
               supposition that contact with her, di-
               rectly or indirectly, is held to negate
               and render useless all supernatural or
               magico-protective powers possessed by
               either persons or spirits or objects.
               Even by direct contact, therefore, an
               un-clean woman is capable of breaking
               down all barriers which stand between
               defenseless man and those evil unseen
               powers which beset him on every

               tions, is common to all nonliterate cul
               tures.
               Not only is there a tapu against men-
               strual blood, but, in addition, most
               male artists have to abstain from sexual
               intercourse because they believe it has
               an adverse effect on their work. In Oce-
               ania sexual intercourse can endanger or
               nullify a carver’s mana. In Africa an
               Anang carver will not have sexual inter-
               course the night before he begins an
               important carving because his work is
               impeded.5 “Too many acts of inter-
               course is thought to weaken him for a
               day or two, inhibit his desire to carve
               and his creative impulse, cause him to
               shape his pieces poorly, and lead him to

               Warner Muensterberger (1951) was
               the first, to my knowledge, to address
               the issue of women’s exclusion in the
               arts of nonliterate cultures. His article
               emphasized why men felt it necessary
               to exclude women from the major art-
               making processes. In summing up he
               writes:
               The overanxious exclusion of women
               discloses the regressive tendency in-
               volved. The artist relinquishes com-
               munication with an inhibiting or dis-
               turbing environment. Women are
               phobically avoided. . . . The regressive
               tendency for isolation is a security
               measure. Affect is being avoided. Ob-
               jective reality is denied while strength is
               gained from the narcissistic retreat to a
               level of omnipotent fantasy. ..
               these are the conditions under which
               artistic activity among primitive peo-
               ples is possible, then two seemingly
               contradictory tendencies are at work:
               the necessary isolation indicates that
               distance from the oedipal mother is
               sought. The menstruating woman is
               avoided or even dangerous. On the oth
               er hand, reunion with the giving
               mother of the preoedipal phase is
               wanted.
               Muensterberger's Freudian interpre-
               tation is one viewpoint on the seemingl
               universal exclusion of women in the
               arena of “important arts. There are
               however, other ways to examine this
               phenomenon.
               The paradigm for the ritualized pro
               cess of man’s creations may be found in
               the cultural behavior of women durin,
               their menstrual cycles, pregnancy and
               childbirth. When men work on import
               ant objects, they usually do so in seclu
               sion or with other men of status. And
               should they carve in the sanctuary of
               the men’s house, this interior is often
               referred to as the womb.55 When wom-
               en have their menstrual period they us
               ually move to a special house of se-
               clusion or some equivalent; and in
               many cultures there is also a specia
               childbearing area. In these situations
               both the men and women are, in effect
               particularly powerful, negatively or
               positively, and must be removed from
               the realm of the ordinary. During the
               process of creation, both men (creating
               important objects) and women (creat
               ing human life) are subject to specific
               tapus imposed upon them for their own
               and their creation’s protection and the
               implied protection of others. These re
               strictions vary from culture to culture,
               but vulnerability in creation is common
               to both men and women in all nonliter
               ate cultures. If the tapus are broken</p>
            <p>
               men may cut themselves with their
               tools, miscarve a spiritless object or
               even die; women may miscarry, give
               birth to a dead or deformed child or die
               in labor.
               Analogous to this concept is the Poly-
               nesian belief that a new (art) object is
               comparable to a newborn child.
               Like the child, the canoe, house, or oth-
               er object had a soul and a vital principle
               that required strengthening, for all ob
               jects were conscious and animate. ..
               It is evident that the new object, as a
               living being, needed the same kind oj
               rites to free and protect it against evil
               and to endow it with mana and othei
               necessary psychic qualities, as did the
               human infant.
               In looking at other nonliterate cul-
               tures we can find parallels between the
               consecrating” of “important” objects
               and the consecration ceremonies for
               children, particularly the male infant.
               A final point concerns the “creativ
               ity” of male artists. George Kubler
               writes: “Many societies have accord-
               ingly proscribed all recognition of in
               ventive behavior, preferring to reward
               ritual repetition, rather than to permit
               inventive variations.”57 Under different
               situations, inventive variations can and
               do occur, but in the main, the ritualizec
               art process constrains innovation and
               free self-expression. Hieratic art em-
               phasizes repetition and encourages
               clever and ingenious manipulation of
               the iconographic elements within a giv-
               en iconography. Because women do not
               have their own ritualized process of art-
               making and their art is not hieratic, it
               follows that women artists can be more
               innovative and more self-expressive in
               the arts than men. Women, however
               are restricted in their use of materials</p>
            <p>
               and lack of specialized tools, but as typ-
               ified by the work of Abatan and Das-
               umi, they have a great deal of freedom
               in the way they interpret the existing
               iconographic elements and add on new,
               inventive iconographic elements.s
               suggest that the style and technique of
               the arts produced by women is a better
               indicator of the society’s changing no-
               tion of aesthetics than that of the arts
               produced by men. The objects made by
               women are used by everyone: as the
               culture’s aesthetic norm changes, the
               women’s art is the first to reflect this
               since these arts are nonhieratic. In the
               hieratic arts of men, an innovation con-
               joined with an aesthetic change intro-
               duces a state of anxiety as the artist's
               risk factor is high. To introduce an in-
               novative form, the male artist risks his
               religio-political status. He risks offend-
               ing the supernatural realm and the rul-
               ing chiefs. Male artists who do not
               work within a ritualized process and
               are not making hieratic art are apt to be
               the ones with lesser ability and are
               therefore not as reliable as a source of
               aesthetic notion.
               It appears, then, that women are be-
               lieved to have greater innate powers
               than men. Women have the power to
               create and control life. They control life
               through death as signified by the
               menses and abortion. Without children
               the family lineage dies, as do all the an-
               cestors who live in the supernatural
               world. The continuity between the
               present and the past is broken. Women
               are feared and respected for their cre-
               ative powers. Conversely, women who
               are barren lose status; in nonliterate
               cultures a barren woman is undisputed-
               ly grounds for divorce.

               men have created external powers that
               slowly became steeped in ritual and cer-
               emony and sanctioned by the authority
               of the supernatural realm. Women, in
               the main, were excluded from the rit-
               uals of men and more or less con-
               strained in their economic and political
               power. There are exceptions, including
               those women past child-bearing age
               who are viewed as men among
               women. The male artists rival the wom-
               en’s innate powers as both are in the
               position to manipulate the forces of cre-
               ation and continuity.
               How and why women were relegated
               to the less important arts is a gray area
               of conjecture; 1 do not believe it is a
               question of female preference. Rather,
               it is likely that the dominant male
               group has claimed the hieratic arts for
               itself consistently: the men make them
               because they are important and they
               are important because the men make
               them. Should the less dominant group
               (which shall remain unspecified) do
               something valuable, then the men will
               adopt that too. It has been a zero-sum
               game of distribution. The hieratic arts
               became instruments to articulate mean-
               ing structures and problems; in addi-
               tion they were a powerful way to con-
               trol women. Male hieratic art has been
               promoted in general by males to main-
               tain their own importance. It is no won-
               der that men, particularly in nonlit-
               erate cultures where women have
               achieved prominence on political, eco-
               nomic and even religious levels, have
               rarely, if ever, allowed the women to
               create the “important arts. The old
               belief systems bound by tradition are
               hard to break, as witnessed by the scar-
               city of contemporary women artists
               from the third world.</p>

               In Surinam, the Aucaner women carve in soft
               materials, calabashes. What is unusual is the fact
               that the women only embellish the interior of the
               calabash. (LokoLoko village, Surinam, 1975)

               night in a cave. “Her spirit went away in a dream
               and saw a house in which goblins were at work
               plaiting a sun. She saw how it was made, anc
               when they had finished she returned back to her
               home, and then showed her knowledge to the
               men of the village. When they had learned exact
               ly how to make a sun, they hanged the woman, to
               punish her for dealing with sacred matters. To-
               day the oara is sacred and women must not see it.
               Even a glimpse of it meant death for a woman.

               men invented these myths out of guilt.</p>

            <p>
               In discussing the articles we received on different aspects of women and their art in village India, we noticed a recurring
               theme: artmaking in India is in a state of flux. Colonization, industrialization and the impingement of the world market have in
               fluenced choices of material, means of production, the meaning of ritual content, the relationship between artist and consumer
               and the status of the artist in society. Women’s traditional arts such as embroidery and ritual painting on walls and ground,
               themselves often affected by such changes, co-exist with nontraditional forms such as painting on paper produced specifically
               for the market. Nontraditional paintings by women from Mithila have received recent attention through articles, a book and ex-
               hibitions in India and Europe.
               As we discussed the articles submitted to us, a dilemma became apparent since two distinct interpretations of the meaning of
               Mithila paintings in terms of ritual content and social significance emerged. It seemed to us that we were seeing a demonstration
               of ways in which feminist analyses develop and some of the problems in making an accurate woman-centered description.
               Véquaud and Stendhall connected the Maithil’ women to a tradition of independent women artists who perpetuated ancient
               matriarchal customs. We were attracted to their picture of Maithil women as “a nation of women artists.” But as editors we felt
               that this analysis, in the light of fieldwork observations by feminist sociologists, did not adequately reflect the extremely circum-
               scribed life typical of women in village India. We noted, moreover, that the traditional painters of Mithila were women of the
               upper caste, the caste which most strictly requires seclusion of women and absolute obedience to men.
               On the other hand, the sociological writers tended not to emphasize some of the strengths of women, even in this extremely
               segregated (sex and caste) society. Women developed their creativity, forming women’s art traditions outside of male control.
               Most prized by the women themselves is the work derived from weaving raffia or embroidering cloth. Paintings exist in a
               category other than art; they are sacred acts in themselves. But they are exclusively women’s work—and there lies their interest
               to us, as we search for examples of traditional women’s art, their designs, materials and techniques.
               Why a connection was made to matriarchal traditions becomes clearer if we note that in southern India, at least, the ritual
               wall and ground paintings are made in honor of the goddess Lakshmi, who is throughout Hindu India a patron goddess of
               women.? Thus the paintings reinforce female concerns and a sense of female community. However, this is the sense of communi-
               ty that occurs when one group is systematically oppressed. A visually rich and religiously meaningful woman’s art exists. But
               this does not deny, to our dismay, the real exclusion of women of Mithila, as of other areas of India, from full control of their
               lives. —The Editors

               WOMEN OF INDIA
               Sharon Wood</p>
            <p>
               Despite the complex and heterogeneous nature of Indian society, there are certain consistent attitudes and values. Such is the
               case with the status of women: their positions relative to men and to other women, and the practical effects of prevailing atti
               tudes on their lives.
               The following description of the roles open to the majority of women is based on my own observations and written sources,
               Four-fifths of the population are caste Hindus, and unless otherwise indicated, 1 am referring to caste Hindu women.
               The family, not the individual, is the primary economic and social unit in India. A joint family, where married sons, their
               wives, unmarried daughters and parents live together, is the Indian ideal. Most women’s lives are spent within the family court
               yard while men circulate between home, fields, markets, villages and cities. Home is where children first learn to perpetuate the
               subordination of women.
               Inferior status is more evident in North India where many women still practice a modified form of Purdah, seclusion at home
               and covering one’s face in the presence of most men. Purdah became popular during the Muslim rule (approximatel
               1200-1700) and was practiced among royal and upper-class women. Centuries of foreign invaders attacked the North, but prior
               to the British, few penetrated to the South, so it was not necessary to “protect” women by hiding them.
               TOO BAD IT’S AGIRL
               Parents welcome the birth of their first daughter as a manifestation of the goddess of wealth. It is considered pious to give
               away a daughter in marriage, but with each daughter a dowry must be given, and succeeding daughters mean substantial,
               perhaps ruinous expense. Dowries, the only property traditionally allowed to women, supposedly guarantee their maintenance
               in their husband’s family and serve as a tangible measure of economic strength to the community at large. There is considerable
               social pressure to continue the dowry system despite its illegality. Dowries are given by some families who know that the law is
               unenforceable, and by many more who do not know of the law’s existence.
               Sons are preferred because they will remain to contribute financial and physical support, perpetuate the family line and per-
               form necessary funeral rites for their parents.
               Considered temporary residents, daughters are frequently reminded that they will marry and go to live with their in-laws.
               Their share of household work depends on the economic standing and jati (lineage group within broad caste categories) of their
               family. Regardless of caste, all women are expected to know how to cook, clean and care for children.
               Traditional education, memorization of religious texts, was denied to women and the lower castes. Modern education, though
               prestigious, is an economic luxury for women.
               THE ARRANGEMENT
               The major event in most people’s lives is marriage. Families select potential spouses to strengthen or improve their social posi-
               tion. In North India this takes the form of affiliation between families in distant villages, and in South India consolidation within
               a local setting. Thus, a North Indian bride faces total strangers, perhaps a new language, while a South Indian bride may marry
               someone as familiar as a cousin. The transition from parents’ to in-laws’ home is rarely as traumatic for her.
               There are a few socially acceptable alternatives to marriage for upper- or middle-caste women. One is to secure employment in
               a “proper” profession,' such as teaching, and continue to live with their parents, celibate, in a social limbo, their public behavior
               subject to scrutiny and criticism by’neighbors. A more drastic but traditional choice, available to malcontents and nonconform-
               ists of both sexes, is to leave society and become a religious devotee: a hard and often solitary life. Most women get married.
               DEVOTION, DUTY AND SACRIFICE
               By adolescence, young people have witnessed many marriages and know their obligations and expectations. A bride should serve her
               mother-in-law, respectfully avoid older men, show symbolic and real deference to her husband and have babies. She expects to be ill-
               treated by her mother-in-law, to have little in common with her husband except sex and to be allowed occasional visits to her parents
               home where she is a privileged guest.
               During menstruation women are considered unclean and not allowed to cook. Instead of resting indoors, they frequently
               work harder than usual outdoors. As protectors of domestic purity, they are expected to be more ritually strict than men. Defy-
               ing such restrictions is one way women express their anger.
               Childbirth is ritually unclean. Low-caste midwives, otherwise shunned, enter homes of all castes and assist. Their freedom of
               movement is envied by upper-caste women who haven’t fully rationalized and internalized their own sequestered lives.
               On almost every social level, a wife’s status improves with the birth of a child, especially a son. Children are wives’ social insur-
               ance and the most acceptable focus of their attention and affection. If women do not produce sons, husbands who can afford it
               take another wife. Divorce is an unspeakable disgrace, so the first wife stays on, adjusting to her lowered status as a barren
               woman.
               THE LATER YEARS
               Maintenance of a joint family demonstrates stability, reliability and strength to the community, which rewards the family
               with prestige and economic opportunities. But many forces work against its continuance: difficulties of integrating brides into
               the household, rivalries between nuclear units and possible conflict between brothers over family property. These find expres-
               sion in battles between mothers- and daughters-in-law and among brothers’ wives. Quarrels among women are an acceptable
               release of tension. It is believed that women drive apart families which would otherwise remain peaceably united.
               In matters beyond the domestic sphere, women are expected to indirectly wield what power they have through the men in
               their family. A wife’s status depends on her husband’s position in the household: after his mother, the oldest son’s wife has the
               most authority. Some widowed mothers have considerable influence over their sons, much to the displeasure of the sons’ wives.</p>

               Antagonism between mothers- and daughters-in-law keeps them divided, competing for their son/husband’s support, and
               diverts them from more fundamental sources of discontent inherent in the repressive hierarchy of family relations.
               Age is respected, and unless widowed, women can attain a secure and powerful position in their later years.
               Treatment of widows varies widely depending on their age, relations with their children and family resources. Young,
               childless widows dependent on their in-laws are undoubtedly treated the worst. Widows’ heads are shaved, their glass jewelry
               broken and their saris replaced by permanent mourning clothes. Widows are not allowed to remarry. A proper widow should
               devote herself to religion and quietly pine away. Those with the means, interest and determination become involved in com-
               munity social services or charity work.
               In later life, people are encouraged to turn to religion, the selection and practice of which provide more personal choice than
               any other aspect of Indian life. Continued participation in family and social activities is frowned upon.
               ANOTHER WORLD
               Low-caste, Harijan (untouchable) and tribal women are more independent economically, socially and ritually. Poverty forces
               them to work, and although they receive lower salaries than men, the result is freedom unknown to their upper-caste sisters.
               They choose their husbands, leave or divorce them and remarry if widowed. This is possible because these people are so poor
               that a woman’s wage-earning ability is of great value. But Harijan and tribal women must contend with real and threatened vio-
               lence, insults and humiliation due to their caste ranking.
               HOW MUCH CONTROL DO WOMEN HAVE OVER THEIR OWN LIVES?
               In one lifetime, women fulfill a number of assigned roles, each with its own privileges and constraints. Transitions between
               roles are often abrupt, making it very difficult to retain and consolidate power or authority.
               Upper-caste women have more economic security and community respect, accompanied by physical and social confinement.
               Lower-caste women have the possibility of choice in their domestic relations, but live and die in crushing poverty.
               A U.N. report notes that on a worldwide basis
               .. .even where women have made major gains in acquiring access to knowledge, training and economic independence,
               their share in decision-making in both the family and in public life—that is, their share of political power—appears to lag
               behind their share in other resources.?</p>

               ’The ideal profession is medicine. Doctors may defy almost all domestic and societal restrictions and still are highly respected. Nursing, however, is undesirable
               because it is associated with traditional midwifery, a low-caste profession.

               On The Status of Women in India</p>
            <p>
               Contrary to demographic averages, the ratio of men to women in
               India is 100:93. This is attributed to the neglect of females.
               90% of abandoned babies in Delhi, the Indian capital, are female.§
               The Indian Constitution proposed universal, free, compulsory edu-
               cation but postponed it to 1965, then to 1981. In 1971, 97% of boys
               and 62% of girls aged 6 to 11 years were enrolled in school. Actual
               attendance figures were not available.
               60% of all children drop out of school before the fifth grade.†
               39% of the male and 18.7% of the female population were literate in
               1974; 40% of the “literate” women can only sign their names.
               4/5 of the population is rural; 13.2% of rural women are literate.
               Women formed 18% of the work force in 1971, a decrease from 27
               in 1961. The official explanation was “economic stagnation,” but
               employers use protective labor laws as excuses to not hire women.7
               80% of working women are agricultural laborers, 15% work in fac-
               tories or plantations, or as unorganized laborers such as bidi (cig-
               arette) makers, hawkers, and domestic servants. 90% of working
               women are illiterate.7</p>
            <p>
               5% of urban women who matriculated and 20% of university grad-
               uates find work; only 0.4% of Indian women hold degrees.
               50% of employed, educated women teach primary school, 15% are
               clerks or typists, 15% teach secondary school, 7% are nurses and 10%
               are doctors, lawyers, college teachers, artists, administrators, etc.†
               15% of all rural women are married before 14 years of age.
               71% of women aged 15 to 19 were married, widowed or divorced in
               1961.§
               100,000 women, mostly widows, aged 20 to 45, become destitute
               every year due to lack of work.
               Life expectancy for men is 51.3 years, and 49.6 for women.

               Embroidery from the Northwest
               Zette Emmons
               In the 700,000 villages of India, the peasant woman is born into a set of prescribed rituals which she is responsible for maintaining and
               transmitting. Traditional art is one form these rituals take; in Northwestern India, an area historically rich in all kinds of textiles, peasant
               women embroider. A classification of textiles made in India for domestic use includes “skilled work of weavers and dyers, who work close to
               large market towns; articles of luxury made under court patronage or in the court tradition; folk embroidery; and fabrics of the aborigina
               tribes.”* The first two forms of production are dominated by male weavers and craftsmen working in a commercial structure. The fourth is
               outside the mainstream of Indian village life, though folk embroidery draws upon many aboriginal antecedents which have become tangled
               with Islamic and Hindu influences.
               The depth of religious feeling and devotion that permeates Indian village life does not exist in the West in any comparable way, and it is fron
               this regard for the deities that the impulse to create something beautiful and worthy seems to come. Outer and inner worlds are merged in a
               relationship kept flowing and harmonious by the constant application of visible symbols and signs. Everything is part of everything else; there
               is none of the “disconnectedness” that is so much a part of life in the West. When the woman embroiders, she is conscious of the decorativenes
               of what she does, but she also has the satisfaction of honoring the world of the spirits residing in the plants and animals which she imitates in
               thread. Even the poorest village woman is capable of making her life more bearable and secure by the application of decoration to her house on
               herself. A Krishna proverb which applies to village women at work is—“I take the form desired by my worshippers.”2
               Women wear blouses, full skirts and shawls, all heavily embroidered. They spend their spare time embroidering not only their own clothing
               or trousseaus for their daughters, but also natis (children s headdresses), toranas (wall hangings), animal trappings and small bags for carrying
               jewelry and other small items. To wear someone else’s clothing would be unthinkable. When the wearer dies or when a garment is worn out,
               the old garment is cast off.
               Patterns to be embroidered are drawn onto cloth, which is worked in flat sections and sewn together when finished. Chain, cross and but-
               tonhole stitches cover the surface with patterns; satin stitching fills large areas with color. Small mirrors or pieces of mica are used extensively,
               interspersed fancifully with the embroidery. Mirrors also decorate walls, furniture and even chicken coops. They are not only attractive.
               flashing in the sun, but also frighten away demons.
               In the designs of peasant women in all parts of India, the essences of the animals, flowers and gods are revealed, emphasized by repetition.
               Dots, triangles and lines are arranged in panels surrounding abstracted symbols and objects. Even buses, bicycles and airplanes may be incor-
               porated into the work. The sense of color is more pronounced in the Northwest than in any other part of India. Traditional dyes have been
               derived from indigo, cochineal (red made from crushed insect bodies), iron filings (black), saffron and various other plants yielding yellows and
               oranges. Pupul Jayaker of the All-India Handicrafts Board describes the emotional content for peasant women of the colors they use.
               Red was the color of Chunari, a tie-dyed sari, and was the symbol of sohog, the first days of marriage and love-play. It was
               the garment worn by the Abhisarika, the young woman seeking in the darkness of night her waiting beloved. Saffron or
               gerua was the color of Vasant, of spring, of young mango blossoms, of swarms of bees, of southern winds and the passionate
               cry of mating birds. Maroon and black were the colors of mourning. Blue or nil, the color of indigo, was also the color of
               Krishna, the cowherd child-god who bore the name of Navjaldhar—he who is of that color, that of the newly formed cloud,
               dormant with the darkness that is rain. But there was another blue, Hari nil, or the color of water which is reflecting a clear
               spring sky.
               Daughters learn embroidery from their mothers who teach not only the techniques but the mythology that provides much of the subject mat
               ter for their images. Styles in the village gradually change according to the inclination of successive generations of artists and the impact of
               cultures. Islamic influence is seen in the geometric mazes and flower patterns; the bright colors and looser flowing lines are Hindu in origin.
               In the twentieth century industrialization has made inroads on every Indian village, no matter how remote. The survival of women’s arts,
               especially embroidery is being threatened by the adoption of bright, mill-made cloth. Synthetic dyes have largely replaced traditional ones. Im-
               itation printed or machine-sewn embroidery also appears now in place of the real thing. In recognition of this the All-India Handicrafts Board
               has provided incentives for maintaining quality by turning some previously noncommercial arts into quality-controlled commodities. This
               often has the opposite effect of the one intended, because the spark of life may go out of work produced for an unknown market whose needs
               are irrelevant to the rural craftsperson. Gandhi believed that it was possible and desirable for India to return to a village-centered economy in
               which the machine would be relegated to a minor role and the villager dictate the pace of life. Although his ideas are out of favor in present-day
               India, there is still a sentimental longing for that kind of simplicity in which the drive to create and survive comes out of the soil. The peasant
               woman holds on to the old ways for the time being, but there is no doubt that even she will become a victim, willing or not, of the changes that
               have afflicted the West since the industrial revolution.

               Mithila Paintings
               Mithila is a large region in North Bihar with an ancient high culture which is represented in the Sanskrit written tradition of the Brahman
               caste. The “painting women of Mithila” who belong to this elite sociocultural stratum are a numerical minority. They have more leisure time to
               practice their art skills than do women of lower castes.
               What is specific to the art of these Maithil women? To answer this question it is necessary to understand the traditional hierarchy of arts and
               artisans. As in our own culture, manual labor and handmade art such as sculpture or painting have, in spite of highly developed techniques
               and theories, been considered less prestigious professions than mental labor and intellectual art like poetry. In a male-dominated hierarchica
               society like India’s, the latter sphere is traditionally occupied, with few exceptions, by men of high rank. Tasks requiring skilled hands ar-
               relegated to low-caste occupational specialists
               In addition to the arts and crafts of specialists, nonprofessional domestic art is produced by women as part of their household duties. Orna
               mental decoration with symbolic meaning is made on festive occasions to beautify the home, household utensils, and those who live in the
               house. The numerous festivities of the life and calendar cycles, especially marriages, are functional occasions for the art of women. The most
               eye-catching of the domestic arts are the wall and floor drawings, two aspects of the total range of women’s traditional arts which use many
               media, styles and contents. Wall murals feature motifs of gods and goddesses, epic scenes, brides and grooms and fertility symbols. Floor
               designs are made with rice flour dissolved in water and drawn with the fingers to mark a kind of ground altar for household rituals. What is
               considered the ritual center of the drawing is covered very carefully with earth after ritual use so that no one will accidentally step on it. The
               other ornamental forms, however, remain exposed to the sun and rain.
               Objects of high aesthetic quality are created as gifts for friends and relatives and as donations to the gods. Such domestic art done by women
               is usually not highly esteemed. In fact the concept of art is usually not applied to it though its creative qualities equal those of classical art
               There are various explanations for the low prestige of women’s traditional domestic arts:
               The objects are primarily functional, having an everyday household use rather than being representative monuments of social prestige. In
               addition, symbolic items are prepared for one time use only in a specific ritual context
               The raw material out of which the art is made is usually regarded as being of little value because it is freely available, e.g., grass, mud.
               flowers and other organic material, self-prepared colors. Also, the materials tend not to be durable so that objects become unattractive within a
               short time. The objects are predominantly hand-worked. Highly developed tools and technologies are rarely used in their production. Thi
               kind of art is available without cost, a feature which tends to undermine its appreciation
               High-caste Brahman males may become defiled by doing manual labor; thus domestic work is left to low-caste servants and housewives. In
               this context, how was it possible that out of the mass of women in India a few could break out of the rigid traditional value system to become
               famous as a group in the world market of naive and folk art, producing paintings which sell as “Mithila paintings”?
               A clue to the answer lies in the word “market.” In 1967-1968, after a famine, the government of India carried out a relief program in North
               Bihar. At that time, various handicrafts were bought and women were encouraged to prepare sikki grass work and other traditional folk arts on
               payment. Pupul Jayakar, the woman who headed the Handicrafts and Handlooms Exports Corporation at that time in Delhi, introduced the
               idea of distributing handmade paper among village women so that they could transfer their traditional motifs from murals and floor designs or
               to paper and create marketable products. The All-India Handicrafts Board promoted this project. In response to a Western demand for naive
               and folk art with ritual and oriental themes, the Mithila paintings became commercially successful. Unlike the ritual traditional art forms, the
               paintings on paper are not symbolic forms of meditation and prayer, but are made explicitly in order to eamn money. (When the demand is
               there, they are produced daily.) This, at least, is the way the women themselves view their artistic achievements
               About 500 women in the region paint for the market. For most women painting is not the main source of family income. The money earned
               through painting is rarely available for personal use. In most cases, male members of the family collect and spend the money the women earn.
               But even though the earnings are not theirs to keep, most benefit from their work either psychologically or by eliciting what has rarely beer
               possible for them—social prestige and respect from male family members. (Three of the women received the highest prize, the “Nationa
               Award of Master-Craftsmen” from the All-India Handicrafts Board.) Together, the women painters of Mithila have achieved collective
               acclaim for their region
               The concepts of art and creativity in our Westem sense do not exist at all in this context. What we mean by traditional art is for these women
               a part of domestic ritual decoration, which extends far beyond the area of drawing and painting. Painting has been selected for promotion from
               the whole complex of domestic art skills because critical criteria have been brought in from the outside. These criteria, deduced from Western
               traditional art academic categories, value painting as highly-esteemed bourgeois art. Typical female skills like embroidery do not have much
               worth on such scales. The women of Mithila in fact value textile art skills and, above all, the fine weaving of sikki, higher than painting
               Interestingly, when formerly disregarded female work succeeds commercially, males join the ranks, and, in this case, even Brahman mer
               have acted as helpers, publicity agents or even as painters.
               The art of the women of Mithila is exemplary of an indigenous woman’s art as opposed to women’s art in the West which still, in the realm of
               "fine” arts, may be regarded as imitative of dominating male art styles. The ideology that male artists have been the major creative geniuses
               and that women have been the followers is usually accepted without question on the simple basis that there have been more famous male artists
               in the history of art. Only in some seemingly insignificant corners of the world has female creativity had the chance to develop without male
               competition, mainly in the domestic sphere</p>

   <head><title>Quill Art</title></head>   
   <byline>Carolyn Berry</byline>
   <p>
               Quillwork, the decoration of anima.
               skins with dyed and natural porcupine
               quills, was unique to North American
               Indian culture and practiced only by
               women. This art form probably origin-
               ated in the Great Lakes area and the
               surrounding woodlands. As white inva-
               sion and colonization intensified, the
               various tribes of corn farmers originally
               inhabiting the area migrated west to the
               Plains where eventually their culture
               centered on buffalo hunting. The Chey-
               enne were one such tribe who brought
               with them women s ancient art of quill-
               work.</p>
               <p>A balance of power existed within
               Cheyenne society. Chiefs were men,
               but there were memories of women’s
               holding this position. Cheyenne society
               was matrilineal. Women owned the
               tipis in which they lived with their hus-
               band, daughters, daughters’ husbands
               and unmarried sons. A wealthy man
               could have more than one wife; fre-
               quently sisters married the same man.
               If the first wife didn’t approve of her
               husband’s choice she could divorce
               him, although she might commit sui-
               cide (by hanging herself with her
               braids). Chastity was highly honored;
               girls and women wore the chastity rope.
               Seduction and rape were extremely rare
               (as was murder). Girls puberty was
               celebrated ritually, and women main-
               tained their own societies, traditions,
               religious beliefs and secular position.
               Sharing of work by women made possi-
               ble the long hours necessary for such a
               precise and painstaking art as quill-
               work.</p>
               <p>Quills, obtained from porcupines
               which the men hunted, were removed
               promptly, sorted into different sizes
               and stored in bladder bags. The largest
               and coarsest quills, taken from the tail,
               were used in broad masses of embroid-
               ery. Medium quills came from the back
               of the animal and small ones from the
               neck. The finest were taken from the
               belly and were used for the most deli-
               cate lines so noticeable in the exquisite
               work to be found in early specimens.
               After sorting, the quills were boiled
               with natural dyes usually found locally,
               although Cheyenne would travel great
               distances to find plants needed for par-
               ticular colors. Dye stuffs included
               moss, stones, buffalo-berries, wild
               grapes, cattails, oak bark and many
               other barks, flowers and seeds. The in-
               gredients and process were often kept
               secret. Eventually quills were colored
               with commercial dyes or soak-
               Pair of quilled moccasins
               ed with dyed trade cloth.</p>
               <p>Quills were sewn onto skins Indian, Heye
               tanned by the women; in this
               Foundation
               process, many days long, the
               skin was stretched, scraped,
               bleached, softened and
               stretched once again. Tanning
               tools were handed down by
               women from generation to
               generation. After tanning the
               skins, the woman would cut
               and shape the leather into the object
               she intended to embroider with quills.</p>
               <p>As she worked, the woman held a
               supply of quills in her mouth to soften
               them so they could be flattened. Since
               they would split if punctured, quills
               were held to the skin between rows of
               stitches or with a stitch over each quill.
               Sinew, dried black grass and fine roots
               were used for sewing. The sinew thread
               was kept moist except for one end,
               which was licked, twisted and let dry to
               stiffen. This was then threaded through
               holes made in the hide with an awl. Ex-
               tra sewing supplies were carried in a
               quill-decorated purse trappers called
               possible-sacks, in which women also
               kept small ornaments, medicine, count-
               ers for gambling, plum stones for the
               seed game and clothes for small child-
               ren.</p>
               <p>Countless articles for daily and ritual
               use were embroidered with quills: to-
               bacco and tinder bags, work bags,
               knife cases, cradles, burden straps,
               moccasins, shirts, leggings, arm and leg
               bands, robes, horse trappings, dresses,
               deerskin rolls for braided hair, lodge
               linings, stars for lodges, back-rests, pil-
               lows, lodge sacks, flutes, saddles
               combs, stick rattles for dancing and
               ceremonial gift pipes.</p>
               <p>The two distinct natural surfaces-
               the soft tanned hide and the stiff col-
               ored quills—made an extraordinary
               and beautiful art form. The quills were
               shiny, almost translucent, as if some
               spirit of the animal remained. Later
               when beads were used in many of the
               ancient quill patterns, old people often
               complained that they had no life, that
               beads were dead. Though quills were
               individually small, the mass of a rope
               decorated with them was large and
               glowing, colorfully accentuating the
               wearer's movements.</p>
               <p>Quillwork was not only beautiful but
               conveyed important symbols. To a               
               considerable extent each article de-
               corated had a characteristic design
               which bore some relation to the use of
               the article or the attributes of its
               owner.””3 A quilled bag for a baby to
               handle was suspended from an elabo-
               rately quilled baby-carrier. The bag               
               contained the child’s umbilical cord
               and was carried for her or his life on the
               left side.</p>
               <p>Some designs were specific to either
               women or men. Turtle designs were
               worn only by women. They were “used
               on the yoke of a woman s dress and leg-
               gings and at the head or side of the ba-
               by-carrier or cradle . . . as a talisman.
               The U-shaped design below the yoke of
               the woman s dress represented the
               breast of the turtle, the wing-like exten-
               sions corresponding to the sides of the
               shell. Used symbolically the turtle de-
               sign had power over the diseases pecu-
               liar to women and also over birth and
               infancy.”</p>
               <p>The red line, much used in both
               quill and beadwork, was known as the
               life span or the trail on which woman
               travels, and was regarded as symbolic
               of that portion of a woman s life during
               which children may be born. Red lines
               or stripes on articles used by women
               were often associated with womens
               functions and virtues and symbolized
               the good life.”5 The face of a girl at her
               first menstrual period was painted with
               red lines (or she might be painted red
               all over). Red lines around the edge of a
               lodge indicated that people coming into
               the camp would be fed by the women
               living there.</p>
               <p>In Cheyenne quillwork the majority
               of designs were abstract. They “had
               significance above specific happenings
               and were related to religion. These de-
               signs were composed of symbols which
               followed the pure geometric forms
               woman s art). Later they acquired a
               protective connotation in which a cir-
               cle, spiral or some other motif repre-
               sented the power which would offer
               magical aid or give comfort to the one
               for whom the needlework was made.
               Circles representing the ancient sacred
               circle were used in both women’s and
               men s'art. Women added quilled circles
               to robes as holy protective objects.</p>
               <p>In the art of the Cheyenne (and the
               Sioux) a spiderweb design was quilled
               onto a child’s robe by a medicine wom-
               an as a symbol of power and future
               well-being. Since a spider s work fre-
               quently has been a metaphor for
               women s weaving and embroidery, this
               recurrent design may have had symbol
               ic importance for the Cheyenne. The
               analysis of women s iconography has
               been overlooked in most descriptions of
               their work, which also discount the
               women s style as merely decorative
               because it is abstract.</p>
               <p>When Americans or others
               commissioned an Indian woman to
               quill or bead an object, they often
               expected a replica of something
               beautiful they had seen and ad-
               mired. The showman Buffalo Bill
               asked a famous Cheyenne woman,
               “The Bead Woman, to make a dec-
               orated shirt for him, but was unhap-
               py with it because it was a floral de-
               sign. When he ordered another one</p>

               from another Cheyenne woman he was
               again disappointed. He was not aware
               that “the Cheyenne designs are a sa-
               cred trust that comes down the wom-
               an’s line, to be used only for full-
               bloods.
               As quillworkers women participated
               in creating ritually important objects.
               They worked with the men in the crea-
               tion of scalp shirts which held the hair
               of enemies killed and horses wounded
               in battle. Only the bravest men could
               possess them, and only the most moral
               women decorated them. Men hunted
               the animal and women tanned the skin.
               Men painted the shirt and women quill-
               ed or beaded the panels with sacred de-
               signs. Each did the work under strict
               supervision of an honored person of
               their sex who had done the work before
               and was ritually approved.
               Sacred quillwork was permitted only
               to members of the Quillworkers Society
               which, like the Women’s War Society,
               consisted of the most courageous and
               skilled women, known as Mon in i heo,
               the selected ones.1° Quillwork “must be
               done in prescribed ceremonial fashion.
               and the (initiate must be taught to per-
               form it by some member Jof the Socie-
               tyj who had previously done the same
               thing. The making and offering of such
               a robe [or other item) in the prescribec
               way secured the maker admission to the
               Society of women who had done similar
               things.”11 A candidate would announce
               her intention to embellish a certain
               item, usually to bring protection to a
               child or warrior or to fulfill a sacred
               vow. If the Society approved, a crier
               announced the plan to the tribe.
               The woman prepared a feast for
               members of the Society. These individ-
               uals reviewed past creations—the de-
               signs and the circumstances—very
               much as warriors recounted their
               coups. After the feast an old woman
               was asked to make the design for the
               robe, which she drew on the skin with a
               stick and white clay.12 Throughout the
               long period of work to make the robe or
               other objects there were many strict ob-
               servances. If the woman made a
               mistake in sewing, a brave man who
               had counted many coups was called</p>

               cowrie and dentalium shells (Museum of the
               American Indian, Heye Foundation)</p>
            <p>
               upon. Reciting his experiences, he slip-
               ped his knife under the sinew to cut the
               thread. The completion of the object
               was announced by the crier of the Soci-
               ety and ceremonies followed.
               Cheyenne tradition respected the
               Quillworkers Society whose “origins
               were sacred, for their ritual and cere-
               monies came from the Man who mar-
               ried the Buffalo Wife. The traditions
               concerning the Buffalo Wife are, in
               turn, linked to the coming of the Sun
               Dance ceremonies from the Buffalo
               people themselves.13 Part of the
               strength and power that enabled the
               women to do the work emanated from-
               the sacred bundle associated with the
               Society." Their work was so important
               that a warrior could count coups on a
               completed work under certain condi-
               tions.
               Glass beads and woolen and cotton
               cloth became valued trade items for the
               Plains tribes. As early as 1595 Euro-
               peans were considering what color
               beads provided the best rate of ex
               change.15 Women adopted beads for
               traditional and innovated designs. By
               1850 cloth was replacing skins for use
               as robes or being combined with skin
               on various articles.16 Quilling was the
               preferred way to embellish highly reli-</p>
            <p>
               gious objects, even after beadwork had
               become popular.
               Around the time the tribe was being
               relocated in Oklahoma (Indian Ter-
               ritory), many fine old pieces were trad-
               ed for horses, especially when one
               group, the Northern Cheyenne, started
               returning to its native lands. Traders,
               aware of how extraordinary these ob-
               jects were, had begun to obtain them in
               the mid-19th century and maybe earli-
               er. It is remarkable that any of the fra-
               gile quillwork survived the years of
               warfare and relocations during which
               the Cheyenne struggled for their very
               existence as a culture. Because of the
               reverence in which sacred quillwork
               was held, skins decorated with ceremo-
               nial symbols were handed down for
               centuries from one generation to
               another.1
               Today Cheyenne women make bead-
               work in the old way, but it is slow, as it
               has always been. No one doubts its val-
               ue or beauty, but the women say no one
               will pay for the labor necessary to make
               elaborate pieces with customary care.
               Despite the difficulty for Cheyenne
               women of obtaining materials and the
               necessity of their selling work for in-
               come, the Beadworkers Society still
               sponsors women’s honored work, con-
               tinuing traditional tribal values. Its ex-
               istence reflects the strength of Chey-
               enne women—particularly as a force
               for maintaining their culture in the rap-
               idly-changing world in which they now
               live.</p>

               Turkmen „omen,
               weaving and
               Cultural Change
               Mary A. Martin</p>
            <p>
               Turkmen carpets are fine examples of weaving done by
               nomadic tribal women. In the last 100 years the context of
               weaving these carpets has changed considerably; formerly
               women produced them in the home for local consumption,
               now contract weavers and female and male factory workers
               produce for urban and foreign markets. In the nineteenth
               century the Turkmen lived in the Kara Kum desert in that
               part of Central Asia which is now the Soviet Socialist Repub-
               lic of Turkmenistan. This tribe primarily raised sheep and
               occasionally farmed. They sometimes raided neighboring
               areas. Nomads, they lived in tents called yurts which could
               be packed up and taken with them when they moved from
               one grazing area to another.
               Traditionally women made textile items for domestic use.
               For their yurts they made felt walls and decorative bands.
               They also knotted or embroidered individual bags for carry
               ing tent poles, utensils, provisions and other household pos-
               sessions. A special carpet was hung at the entrance of the
               yurt and another was hung to function as a door.
               Carpets woven by women were central to household, cul-
               tural and religious life: used for entertaining, given as gifts,
               spread for community gatherings, used to furnish guesthous-
               es, and used for prayers. Turkmen society regarded a wom-
               an’s weaving skill much as it esteemed a man s code of valor;
               weaving defined a woman’s status, indirectly gave her access
               to wealth, was the one domaiń in which a woman was able to
               distinguish herself.
               In the latter half of the nineteenth century the life of the
               Turkmen changed because Russia took permanent political</p>
            <p>
               and military control and inhibited Turkmen raids of sur-
               rounding populations. At this time many Turkmen moved to
               Afghani territory although it was not until the 1920s that
               large numbers fled to Afghanistan to escape Soviet collectiv-
               ization.
               In Afghanistan the Turkmen competed for pastures and
               living space with other ethnic groups—Pashtun, Aimaq,
               Hazara, Tajik, Baluch, Arab and Uzbeg. As the pasturage
               was limited in Afghanistan and Turkmen flocks reduced,
               many Turkmen settled into villages; few continued to live as
               nomads in yurts. If families did not raise enough sheep to
               provide wool for their weaving needs they had to purchase
               it—no longer from other Turkmen but from other tribes,
               such as the tent-dwelling Pashtun. Individual or market
               trading formerly carried out with kinsmen and other Turk-
               men was now done with groups who were neither.
               The move to Afghanistan severely affected carpet weav-
               ing. For ten to fifteen years after arriving in Afghanistan
               Turkmen women did not make carpets.* When they began
               making carpets again, they had to overcome this break in
               tradition. They remembered carding, spinning and weaving
               techniques, but colors and patterns changed. Young girls
               had grown up without learning the traditional designs. When
               older women had died, they had taken with them the knowl-
               edge of traditional patterns and of dye recipes. Changes in
               color in twentieth-century carpets may also be related to the
               difficulty of obtaining customary vegetable dyes and mor-
               dants in a new ecological setting. The breed of sheep and
               quality of wool also differed in the new environment. De-</p>

               signs once unique to particular tribal sections, isolated from
               each other in the past, changed as they came into direct con-
               tact with each other. Women now married into other groups
               which led to the mixing of traditional designs.
               The society in which Turkmen live has been transformed
               since the nineteenth century, affecting the women who tradi-
               tionally weave the carpets as well as their relation to the
               mode of production of these carpets. Production has shifted
               its locus from kinship units to a nonkinship context, the fac-
               tory. The family mode of production could not meet the ris-
               ing demand for carpets, thus contract weaving and factories
               increased.
               The first factories in the provinces employed only men,
               but women were weaving out of the home in women’s centers
               or prisons at that time. In the past few years factories in
               Kabul have begun to train and employ women who weave in
               rooms separate from the men. Because of the profit to be
               gained from weaving, non-Turkmen women have begun to
               take up carpet weaving—often by apprenticing themselves to
               Turkmen women in their homes or by going to the factories
               to learn. Weaving now serves as one of the few nondomestic
               occupations open to women in Afghanistan. At a time when
               the family-centered tribal society is breaking down, carpet
               weaving allows women an opportunity to participate in a
               more complex, non-kin-based economy.
               Since the days when Turkmen women lived on the Rus-
               sian steppes and wove for their families, conditions have
               changed. The women who remained in the Soviet Union
               were employed in state-controlled factories before the women</p>
            <p>
               who moved to Afghanistan.
               Afghani Turkmen women still weave under traditional
               conditions or on contract; primarily it is non-Turkmen
               women in Afghanistan who have begun factory work. Where
               Turkmen women oversee the process in factories, the high
               quality of weave has been maintained.
               Turkmen women have always had an important influence
               on weaving, originally produced for exclusively domestic use
               but now produced for market consumption as well. Although
               the traditional colors and designs have changed because of
               political boundaries, migration and altered modes of produc-
               tion, Turkmen women continue to produce fine examples of
               weaving.

               Kongo Pottery: Woman’s Art from Zaire Janet MacGaffey</p>
            <p/>
            <p>
               The superb work done by some
               African potters has been neglected as
               an art form and, since pottery is fragile
               and hard to transport, few examples of
               their work appear in museums. Potters
               among the Kongo people of Western
               Zaire in Central Africa are women and
               in the region in which I lived during the
               course of anthropological fieldwork.
               they make a matte black ware. Its pro-
               duction continues to flourish in the face
               of competition from factory-made pro-
               ducts, although on a smaller scale than
               in the past, because the potters have
               adapted the form and function of thei
               pots to changing social conditions.
               One of these potters is Mayivangwa
               Thérèse. Watching her making a pot
               one is struck by her absolute absorption
               and obvious satisfaction and enjoyment
               in perfecting its shape and decorating
               it. Sometimes she sings to herself as she
               smoothes a surface or incises a hatched</p>
            <p>
               band of decoration. Her meticulous
               care in achieving a perfectly shaped pot
               or delicately attached molded ornamen-
               tation is the mark of a perfectionist and
               her works are masterpieces of the pot-
               ter’s art.
               To reach her village, Mbanza Man-
               teke, 1 found a local truck carrying
               passengers and produce. The houses in
               Manteke are strung along the road and
               vary from cement block to adobe brick
               to wattle and daub. Arriving in the vil-
               lage on a hot afternoon I found Mayi-
               vangwa sitting on a mat behind her
               house making pots. She does not do this
               every day since potting is a part-time
               occupation that has to be fitted in with
               all the other things a Kongo woman
               does. Women produce and prepare all
               the food—sowing, cultivating and har-
               vesting the crops—as well as fetching
               water and firewood, and caring for their
               homes and children. When potting,</p>
            <p>
               Mayivangwa works for most of the day.
               making a number of pots in each of
               several styles, drying and storing them
               until she has a number suitable for
               firing.
               The village of Mbanza Manteke has
               a population of 582. It is the seat o
               local government for the district and
               has a school, dispensary and the offices
               of the mayor and police, but most of the
               villagers are subsistence farmers with
               little monev. The village is isolated
               from town life with its stores and busi-
               nesses, which is why Mayivangwa’s
               pots are still in demand in the village
               despite the influx into Zaire of ename
               ware, cheap crockery and aluminum
               pots and pans.
               Traditionally pots were made for
               purely utilitarian purposes; their decor-
               ation and artistic merit varied accord-
               ing to the talent and creativity of the
               potter. Big conical vessels for cooking</p>
            
            <p>
               were set over an open fire on three
               hearthstones; small bowls were used for
               eating and drinking; small water car-
               riers fit into a long, narrow, plaited
               palm-frond basket carried from the
               spring on a woman’s head; large jars
               two feet high were kept in houses to
               store and cool water.
               A Kongo woman has a budget separ
               ate from her husband’s; once she has
               fed her family she can do what she
               wants with the surplus produce of hei
               fields and keep the proceeds if she sells
               it. Likewise a potter keeps the money
               she earns from selling pots.
               Mayivangwa sells her pots for a
               small sum in the village: in 1965 the
               price was about 25 cents. Sometimes
               she takes some to Kinshasa where thej
               fetch about six dollars in the Ivor
               Market, a big market in the city center
               catering to tourists and the wealthy
               The reason for the higher price in the</p>
            <p>
               city is a change in the function of these
               pots: from being considered purely util
               itarian objects they are now in demand
               in the city as items of traditional art
               For some time Mayivangwa has been
               making a number of purely ornamenta
               pottery pieces, as well as the traditional
               utilitarian forms, to cater to this new
               art market. Some examples are shown
               here: two elephants, a water pot in the
               form of a chicken and a duck. They re-
               flect the influence of European orna-
               mental china animals that Mayivangwa
               has seen in stores or that have been
               brought home to the village by sailors.
               but she has created her own African-
               ized version, decorated with molded
               snakes and lizards. These creatures
               also appear on her water pots. Their
               significance is that they are considered
               by the Kongo to be mediators betweer
               this world and the other world of the
               dead: in Kongo cosmology water and</p>
            <p>
               amphibians are believed to mediate be-
               tween the two worlds.
               At the National Fair in Kinshasa in
               1970 some of Mayivangwa’s pitchers
               and ornamental pieces were exhibited.
               She had previously won prizes at sim-
               ilar events. Hers were the only pots
               from Lower Zaire in the exhibit; potters
               of her ability are rare in this area.
               Generally potters pass on their skills
               to a relative. Mayivangwa is teaching
               her sister who lives in Kinshasa. Thes-
               Kongo women are adapting to industri
               alization and urbanization by main-
               taining traditional forms appropriate to
               life today and responding creatively to
               changing needs.

               Myth and the Sexual Division of Labor
               Virginia Maksymowicz
               Clay is a material packed with connotative richness. For the past few years, it has been my primary medium as a sculptor. The fact that
               many cultures traditionally have assigned clayworking to women began to intrigue me.1 Is it merely the pliability of clay or the fact that it can
               be worked on near the home, among children, that has, in many cases, made it a female-connected material?
               In terms of cross-cultural study (including both Western and non-Western societies), George Murdock and Caterina Provost’ have made one
               of the best attempts at examining some of the contributing factors to sexual division of labor: tendencies for males to be physically stronger than
               females; for females to be “burdened” by pregnancy and childcare, and thus to be assigned to soft materials and simple tools and processes
               and for the sex that utilizes a product to be the sex that produces it. Even though these factors are certainly worth mentioning, Murdock and
               Provost’s study avoids even hypothetical explanations of some of these tendencies and skirts around a major cultural component: the myth.
               Myth permeates the structure of all societies; entire social systems can actually be constructed around myth (modern U.S. society included)
               Since the majority of societies do seem to function, I find it hard to believe that they are based on pure fiction. Myth is not fiction alone. It is,
               in a way, a combination of fact and fiction which results in an “extended” fact (fact + story = extended fact/myth). And so when Murdock
               and Provost suspect at one point that masculine strength is an inadequate explanation for the division of labor, they begin to hit on something:
               perhaps most societies are not based on the actual physical differences between the sexes but on the myths surrounding and extending these
               differences.
               Mythmaking seems to be an attempt to explain the unknown and to unify disparate elements in the world. Whatever its origin or purpose,
               the tendency nevertheless runs strong in humanity and is closely tied to symbolmaking. But while Murdock and Provost have described the
               denotative meanings of tasks and materials in their study, they have overlooked the connotative—the symbolic and mythical aspects to which
               many of these activities and objects are bound. If symbols are “storage units” (Victor Turner’s term’) which consolidate a maximum of infor
               mation and if, as much research has shown, a great number of things have both functional and symbolic meaning, then we can probably
               assume that many sexually assigned tasks are very “loaded” indeed. So maybe it’s not the actual hardness or Softness of the materials, or the
               ease with which they can be worked upon that determines sex divisions (though in extreme cases this might hold true), but the connotations at
               tached to these qualities.
               I propose that the “femaleness” of clay is based on the mythology and symbology surrounding this material rather than on the material itself.
               This seems even more likely when one considers how complex and widespread clay—and, inseparably, earth—symbolism is.
               On a general level most of us have encountered a common modern earth/woman myth: “Mother Earth” is the progenitor of all living things.
               The earth is a womb into which seeds are placed to be nurtured; the sky (masculine) pours down its rain (semen) to produce plant growth (life)
               Countries (home-lands) are quite often referred to in feminine terms. The dead are returned to the earth, their origin, their “mother.” In our so-
               ciety, however, the origin of these myths has been lost. We no longer remember the stories on which they are based. True, we still have the Cre-
               ation in the Book of Genesis, but in terms of earth/woman symbology, the link is weak. Nevertheless the symbolism lingers in verbal analogy
               But on a specific level, how does an individual culture integrate myth with the operative functions of society? While researching this article
               I came across a society where the women are the primary clayworkers and where the female/earth symbolism and mythology are strong: the
               Mwambao Zaramo of Tanzania.
               The Zaramo are matrilineal. Their creation myth (see Marja-Liisa Swantz') traces the origin of life to a woman, Nyalutanga, who is con-
               nected to the origin of everything. The name itself is related to Zaramo verbs meaning to spread about and to nouns referring to large ground
               mats as well as to a cucumber plant which crawls and spreads rapidly. In the myth, Nyalutanga emerges from the earth and, as her name sug
               gests, this first woman and the fertile earth become nearly interchangeable.
               116</p>
            <p/>

            <pb facs="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BucknellDSC/heresies/main/issue04/images/Heresies_04_120.jpg" n="120" xml:id="img_0120"/>

            <p>
               In this story two known facts are combined, and the resulting myth presents an equation: if earth produces life and growth and if woman
               produces life and growth, then earth = woman. The two are mutually symbolic, and one cannot be referred to without invoking the other.
               Thus to be a woman is to be part of the earth and to share in its fertility, to reproduce with vinelike profusion, drawing nourishment from
               decaying matter (the symbolic cucumber plant flourishes on rubbish heaps). Initiated by woman, the earth became covered with people (a
               matrilineal line of descent)
               Accordingly, that which is inextricably bound up with the earth and growth—agriculture and the cultivation of plants—is also symbolic of
               and therefore delegated to, woman. Women are recognized as the originators of cultivation. That Zaramo women are prominent in agricultural
               work is supported by Nyalutanga’s gift of the knowledge and use of plants to women, who in turn instructed the men
               The very existence and cycle of human life are dependent on woman/earth and are consolidated in and assured by Nyalutanga. Everything
               taught to young girls during formal instruction, maturity rites and pregnancy rites centers around this earth mother. She is the link between the
               earth, life and death. In agriculture, decaying life is the fertilizer for new life. In Zaramo mythology, there is a continuing theme of existing life
               arising out of the death of other organic matter. The earth becomes a womb where decay must take place before new life, human life, can
               begin. In Zaramo ritual, female and death symbolism are inseparable: if earth = woman and if the earth brings about decay and death, then
               woman brings about decay and death.
               These life, death and earth ties constantly cross-reference themselves as well as other rituals. A Zaramo birth ritual involves performing a
               ritual burial after delivery. In various versions, the placenta, umbilical cord, first excrement and nail clippings are buried, returned to the
               earth. It is hypothesized that since the child had these things when s/he came into the world, they do not really belong to the child but rather to
               the true mother, the earth, to which they are returned. In another version of the birth ritual, the earth symbolism is reinforced by a reference
               to the death ritual. The placenta and cord are buried under the bed where the mother is resting and waiting to be washed. The bath waters are
               run over her body onto the ground and buried placenta below. The death ritual involves washing the corpse on a similar bed in nearly the same
               manner: the water is allowed to run over the body into a hole in the ground below.
               The same “under the bed,” “close to the ground” ritual elements are apparent and function as female symbolism in extra-ritual activities as
               well. The cooking pots (symbolically female in themselves, not only in Freudian “enclosure” terms, but in terms of their reference to cooking
               and the sustenance of life through food, and their being made of clay) are kept under the bed—again cross-referencing life and death.
               It can be recognized from even these few isolated examples that female/earth symbolism permeates and reinforces Zaramo society. With
               such a strong cross-referencing symbol system, it becomes impossible for anyone but a woman to be involved in clayworking. If women are the
               source of all earth-, life- and death-related activities in every aspect of Zaramo life, then only a woman could employ a material like clay. And
               considering some of the uses to which the earthenware artifacts are put—pots for cooking (nourishment), vessels for washing (birth and death
               rituals)—it is again in keeping with the mythological structure for a woman to make these objects.
               Fortunately, Zaramo mythology is easily accessible and ostensibly at work in their culture. It provides us with an opportunity to see some of
               the origins of sex-linked traditions in their society. Modern Western culture, on the other hand, has managed to overlay its own complex
               mythology with a veneer of apparent (to our eyes, at least) factuality. At this point, we are only beginning to take the first steps toward un
               covering these myths which form the basis of our own cultural conventions.</p>

               Selections from
               Recitation of the
               Yoruba Bride*
               Those who stand—let them stand well
               Those who stoop—let them stoop well.
               Those who sit on the verandah-
               let them receive our thanks.
               You the elders, who have come from
               I thank you for honouring this day.
               pounded yam softly,
               I offered it to Eshu the trickster,
               Eshu refused to eat.
               I prepared yam flour softly,
               Eshu refused to eat.
               Then I asked him:
               Will you stay indoors or outside?
               He said: Outside.
               When the dead come looking for me,
               they will meet Eshu outside.
               When disease comes looking for me,
               it will meet Eshu outside.
               But if a child comes looking for me,
               it will meet me in my room.
               When I left my house
               my father told me
               don’t go through the market.
               I said: But why?
               Are you in debt?
               Do you owe the butcher?
               When I left my home
               my mother told me:
               Don’t go through the market.
               I said: But why?
               Are you in debt to the salt seller
               You people of the world,
               help me to thank my mother,
               for she decked me out in clothes
               rich enough
               to make Olokun jealous,
               the god of the sea.
               My mother dressed me
               in clothes so rich
               1 could confuse a god.
               1 am like a beggar woman
               turned into a king’s daughter.
               They wanted to lead me to my
               husband's house
               like a sheep to the market.
               But my mother said, I should be
               escorted
               like a free born child.
               Let everybody thank my mother:
               she did not allow me to
               borrow dresses
               from those who would abuse me later.
               And you, my friend Ilajue,
               you my best friend:
               This sudden marriage has spoiled
               118</p>
            <p>
               many things for us.
               We have been abusing people
               together,
               we have been scorning together and
               laughing,
               good things and bad, we never did
               them alone.
               They say that marriage brings
               happiness
               greater than any known before.
               But were they thinking of you?
               And you my parents:
               when you don’t see the river
               will you forget the waves?
               When you don’t see the thunder
               will you forget the rain?
               When you don’t see me any more
               will you forget me?
               Is it not you who decide
               when a child is old enough to
               have a quiver?
               Is it not you who decide
               when a child is old enough
               to have an arrow?
               It was you who decided
               that 1 was old enough
               to move into another house.
               Don’t leave me alone in that place.
               What I am proposing to do
               you have done it yourselves with
               success.
               Then let me succeed also.
               If you don’t know an elephant
               at least you hear his voice.
               If you don’t know the sea
               at least you have tasted salt in your
               soup.
               If you don’t know me: don’t you
               hear my voice?
               I looked right
               but I saw no tree
               taller than the silk cotton tree.
               I looked left
               but I saw no tree
               taller than the silk cotton tree.
               I looked in front of me
               but I could not see anyone
               who resembles my father.
               What kind of god created me
               in a sickly town
               to make my relatives die like
               rotten yams?
               If luck is not against me
               I shall have them back
               where 1 am going.
               If luck is not against me
               they shall re-enter the world
               through me.
               May luck not turn against the mother.
               When luck turns against the hunter
               the animal escapes.

               When luck turns against the mother
               she will bury her children,
               as if she were planting yams.
               It is not my head that is bad
               only fate.
               My head—which is wearing a bright
               scarf today—
               will surely give me
               male and female children.
               By this time last year
               my husband was writing angry letters.
               By this time last year
               he was writing fighting letters.
               But when this year came
               he tore up his letters.
               1 am afraid-
               not because 1 am a coward.
               I am afraid-
               not because 1 cannot fight.
               It is this strange house
               that is upsetting me.
               Don’t bathe me in medicines.
               Forget about your charms.
               My mother’s care is enough for me.
               1 honour the bitter kola nut,
               for through it I will gain Shango’s
               favour.
               I honour the red kola nut,
               for through it I will gain the
               favour of the other gods.
               The melon seed soup only offends the
               hungry man
               who was not invited to the feast.
               he smell of fried bananas only
               offends the hungry man
               who was not invited to the feast.
               I who have come to this world
               with ripe breasts
               I have offended my younger sisters.
               Whom shall I turn to in this new
               house?
               In the strange corridors
               I never walked?
               In the strange doors
               1 never entered?
               Whom can 1 turn to in this strange
               house?
               Some of them may say:
               See a loose girl coming.
               Let them talk today-
               for tomorrow they shall be silenced.
               Today is a glorious day.
               From Ulli Beier, ed., Yoruba Poetry C1970
               Cambridge University Press. Reprinted by per-
               mission.
               This long recitation by a bride is an ex-
               ample of improvised poetry that is common
               in Yoruba. The bride is decked out in her
               finery and, accompanied by drummers and
               a crowd of relatives, she is led to her hus-
               band’s house. She is in a state of great excite-
               ment and, chanting all the time, she speaks
               about everything that comes to her mind.</p>

               “By the lakeside there is an echo. As they stand
               there with an open book the chosen passages are
               re-uttered from the other side by a voice that be-
               comes distance and repeats itself . . . I say that
               that which is is. I say that that which is not also is.
               When she repeats the phrase several times the
               double, then triple, voice endlessly superimposes
               that which is and that which is not. The shadows
               brooding over the lake shift and begin to shiver
               because of the vibrations of the voice.
               —Monique Wittig, Lés Guérilleres</epigraph>

            <p>
               For a more complete history of women’s art we must know the actual circumstances of women’s creativity and
               aesthetic contributions to culture. Scholars of traditional societies* assume that men’s “art” is sacred and dangerous
               to women and children, while women’s “craft” is significant only in the daily sphere and of no prime importance.
               These assumptions obscure the real and complex situation of women’s artmaking and totally block an appreciation
               of their art.</p>
   <p>We approached this article from different experiences. One of us, an anthropologist, is concerned with the current debates in feminist anthropological theory about women’s power or lack of it. One argument states that in all
               cultures women, no matter how actively they participate in the society’s life, are always considered inferior to men.
               Is this analysis true or are we so dependent on fragmentary reporting, usually based on the information of men, that
               we have not developed a way of knowing either women or their own evaluation of what they do? The other of us, a
               painter, interested for many years in the arts of Africa and the lives of African women, began this collaboration
               unknowingly influenced by the traditional arts of women. Both of us had been moved by the beauty of women’s art
               in traditional societies and wished to consider the ramifications of women’s public and private artmaking. This arti
               cle comes out of our readings and conversations.</p>
               <p>By assembling and analyzing the sparse information on the art of women in traditional societies we hope to raise
               questions which will provoke further research. We have organized our discussion into categories which emphasize
               questions about the scope of women’s art and its relationship to their societies and to women’s status within those,
               societies.</p>

   <head><title>THE ART OF WOMEN’S RITUALS</title></head>
            <div><p>
               Birth, initiation, marriage and death are ritually
               celebrated by women in most societies and many female
               cults worship a patron goddess or god, but we can find
               only scattered references to the ritual art objects women
               make. Early missionary accounts of earth goddess rites in
               Nigeria’ state that ceramic votary objects and clay
               goddess figures were made by the priestesses and their
               female initiates. Recent reports do not mention women
               making these clay figures.? Agni women of Ghana and
               Mangbetu women of Zaire make ritual funerary ceramics
               with portrait heads. (This anthropomorphic art is
               considered atypical of women’s artmaking.) Ceramic
               “figurines,” abstract in form, are made by adult women
               in many African societies for the initiation rites of girls to
               explain the women’s view of women and sexuality. Made
               of sundried clay, these are rarely collected by museums
               and little known by scholars.? Is women’s ritual art not
               found because researchers assume that women do not
               make ritual art? We presume far more examples exist
               Extensive documentation of these objects is necessary to
               expand our knowledge of women’s art and their lives.</p>

   <head><title>ART AS SYMBOLS OF AUTHORITY</title></head>
   <p>
               Masks, free-standing figures and other carvings (appar-
               ently always made by men) are used as symbols of secular
               authority in traditional societies. Western anthropologists
               and collectors have been especially impressed by these
               forms, since they conform more closely to Western
               definitions of art. As the most frequently collected
               traditional artifacts, they are the most available for study
               These objects are believed to be invested with power anc
               the person who uses them wields that power. (Since they
               are usually commissioned, the artist is not identified with
               the object s power.) The literature implies that since
               women do not use these symbols of authority, they have
               little public power. The following examples show that
               these assumptions are not true.</p>
               <p>In Sierra Leone and Liberia, the all-female Bundu
               society commissions masks for use as symbols of their
               authority. The helmet mask and woven body covering
               worn by the women lend an awesome appearance to their
               dance performance and are invested with such power that
               they are utilized both in funeral rites and in intimidating
               males or females who insult women. In the Ivory Coast
            <note>
               *Tribal and peasant societies, with a nonmechanized technology, and with much social and political life centered on a kin group consisting of
               many generations connected by blood or marriage ties, not partaking indigenously of the Western cultural or economic tradition.

               Senufo women commission carvings for use in their
               divination society, the Sandogo.“ Women’s divination is
               considered essential to determining outcomes of important
               events and discovering causes for social disruptions.
               Although male-commissioned Senufo masks have been
               well analyzed, the art of the Sandogo society is frequently
               not discussed, giving an unbalanced view of women’s
               power in this culture. In stratified societies, such as
               African cultures in which power was wielded jointly by
               female and male sovereigns, art work was commissioned
               by both, but we do not know in what ways it represented
               the female aspects of power.</p>
               <p>Besides commissioned objects, women use dance to
               affirm their authority. Among the Kom and other groups
               in the Cameroons women participate in a disciplinary
               performance called anlu, if a parent or pregnant woman is
               insulted or beaten or an old woman abused, if incest
               occurs, or when the women of the village want to use
               discipline against men.</p>
               <quote>“Anlu is started off by a woman who doubles up in an
               awful position and gives out a high-pitched shrill,
               breaking it by beating on the lips with the four
               fingers. Any woman recognizing the sound does the

               impromptu stanzas informing the people of what

               <head><title>PERSONAL DECORATION</title></head>
            <p>
               In many cultures personal ornamentation, perhaps more
               than any other art form, provides the basis for a complex
               system of signs. The body becomes a background on
               which messages about rank, wealth, sexual maturity,
               marital status and occupation are expressed. Clothing,
               jewelry, tattooing, scarification, body painting and hair
               styling are consciously designed to convey these messages.
               Young Zulu and Swazi women in southeastem Africa
               make necklaces as courting poems in which the beads are
               carefully ordered, each bead a metaphor for a range of
               meanings. White beads, for example, symbolize all that is
               good, and have cleansing and purifying powers. They
               appease ancestors, bring good luck and represent the heart
               and love itself.“ Because societies like these do not use
               writing, such codifications of messages are especially
               significant.</p>

               Why is women’s personal decoration apparently more
               extreme than that of men of their cultures, and why do

               sign of women’s being property and a reinforcement of
               women’s inferior status?</p></div>

   <head><title>THE UTILITARIAN ARTS</title></head>
               <p>Although frequently centered in the home, women’s
               utilitarian arts form a fundamental and pervasive part of
               the public visual aesthetic. Women create a visual enviror
               ment by the arrangement and cleanliness of their tents or
               compounds; the making of pots; the incising of calabashes;
               the weaving, dyeing and embroidering of cloth, baskets,
               mats and rugs; the application of quill and beadwork to
               cloth and skins; and the painting of murals and application
               of decorations to the interior and exterior walls of houses.
               In spite of the documentation of the existence of these arts,
               there is little analysis of them or of the status of the women
               who make them. Why has the impact of women’s art on
               their cultures been so neglected by scholars when it plays
               such a pervasive role in people’s lives?</p>
               <p>Women’s traditional art has received little attention from
               Western writers not only because it is utilitarian but
               because it is almost always abstract. Neither the iconog-
               raphy, the formal structure nor the symbolism of women’s
               abstract images and patterns has received serious attention
               and analysis with a few exceptions, such as a study of
               bokolanfini, “mud” cloth made by Bamana women of
               Mali, which describes the designs as abstractions of specific
               historical events.” The assumption that women’s abstract
               designs have no meaning is directly related to the idea that
               traditional women artists are not creative. How do women’s
               choices of image and pattern reflect their traditions, their
               own inventiveness and concerns of their society?</p>
               <p>In traditional societies men as well as women produce
               utilitarian art. Yet even when they work with the same
               materials their form, content and technique differ markedly
               (for example, Plain buffalo-skin robe designs and the loom
               widths in West Africa and Spanish America). There has
               been no satisfactory explanation of these differences.
               Western art scholars seem to favor psychobiological ex-
               planations, often ignoring the impact of historical events,
               such as colonialism and the introduction of foreign
               technologies.</p>

               <head><title>FEMALE MUSICIANS, BARDS AND SINGERS</title></head>
               <p>Musical instruments are frequently particular to one sex or
               the other. Among the ! Kung of the Kalahari Desert men
               play hunting bows, with one end placed in their mouths.
               Adolescent girls play the pluriarch, the “women’s” instru-
               ment, which consists of several small bows attached to a
               box plucked by the fingers.” Adult women apparently are
               not musicians as often as men. In the context of dance
               !Kung women frequently provide the percussive back-up
               for men’s dances by hand clapping. For their own dances,
               melon tossing, women sing elaborate lyrics and provide
               their own hand clapping. Men can join the women’s dance
               although women cannot join that of men. How do musica
               instruments and musical performances by women reflect
               their roles and status in other spheres?</p>
               <p>Through their lullabies women’s song universally pro-
               vides the earliest environment in which children develop
               language and musical sensibilities. When women work and
               perform rituals together and for each other, song and
               dance play an important part, but have rarely been record-
               ed. The songs’ explicit erotic content (often satiric and
               bantering) may have militated against fuller description.</p>
               <p>Where women have major economic and social roles, as
               in tropical Africa, women s participation and leadership in
               public song and dance performance is traditional.? In other
               cultures where the sexual spheres are more clearly hierar
               chical, men s and women’s music is segregated. In rural
               Yugoslavia there are two categories of songs, “heroes’
               songs and “women’s” songs. Sung before an audience by a
               single male, heroes’ songs idealize the male as heroic war-
               rior. All other songs are called women s songs and are
               usually sung in groups by women, children or men: by
               describing suffering and everyday reality, they reveal
               women’s skepticism and resistance to the heroic ideal.10</p>
               <p>In many agrarian cultures when women sing alone
               before a public audience they are considered prostitutes. A
               respectable woman is therefore restricted in her public
               activities.1 Nomadic Arabic desert cultures, however, en-
               courage women poets of distinction to compose commen-
               taries on their society, which are sung in public. Among
               the Bagarra of the Sudan women bards sing the history of
               the group, lead warriors into battle with songs and in the
               system of tribal justice sing of the crime and punishment
               of the convicted. “In performance a (bard) always stands
               out in the position of respected authority, her wit is ap-
               preciated and her techniques for composition are copied by
               young women aspiring to her position of influence in the
               community.12 In what contexts are women’s musical per-
               formances a commentary on their culture’s history; and in
               what contexts do women articulate their own history,
               myths and opinions through dance and song!</p>

            <head><title>WOMEN ARTISTS’ COMMUNITIES</title></head>
            <p>
               Traditional women artists work in groups either by col-
               laborating on one object (such as the long tapa cloths of
               Polynesia) or by establishing networks for techniques and
               innovations to be exchanged and for traditions to be
               taught. Women artists working as a community have been
               emphasized in research on Pueblo and African potters;
               Pomo, Yurok and Karok (California) basketweavers; and
               Plains quill and bead workers. Although expertise is
               recognized and acknowledged among these women, their
               artmaking is not highly competitive. In the village of
               Ushafa, Nigeria, women who “make the best ware only
               make special pots when commissioned to do so ...
               otherwise, their pots are made to be indistinguishable from
               the rest.”13 How do women artists interact and criticize
               each other’s work in traditional societies, and do their
               communities differ from those of men artists?</p>
               <p>Since colonialism, commissions by traders who deal in
               traditional artifacts have tended to isolate experts from the
               other artists. Modern governments, by creating new
               training centers for the unskilled, have usurped the tradi
               tional roles of the experts. How does the alteration of their
               artistic communities affect women s art and status in their
               cultures?</p>

  <div>          <head><title>WOMEN’S ART AND CULTURAL CHANGE</title></head>
            <p>
               With the introduction of new materials, the substitution of
               imported objects and the influence of new images.
               colonialism and cultural contact have altered the art of
               women in traditional societies. Women’s response has
               often been inventive, appropriating objects and images and
               putting them to novel use. In a Ghana village women
               decorate the exterior doorways of their houses with
               imported china plates, turned to expose the manufacturers
               inscriptions, which they consider picturesque.” Many
               colonized peoples, curious about other cultures, have
               incorporated their observations into their art, sometimes as
               ironic commentary, sometimes as an exploration of
               ’exotic” designs. North American Indian women devel-
               oped vine and flower patterns in their beadwork based,
               perhaps, on the crewel arts of the northern European
               colonists. The art of non-Western women has been appre-
               ciated in turn by Western women and used to decorate
               their homes. Near Eastern and native American rugs, for
               example, are a traditional women’s art which has had a
               special place in the aesthetic environment of Western
               people. In contrast to the intense interest of art historians
               in discovering exactly when Western artists first saw
               African masks, the influences of the women’s art from
               traditional societies on Western art of all kinds remains
               undocumented.
               The impact of colonialism has been contradictory for
               women. In some cases it has weakened the hold of
               patriarchs over women. In others, by ignoring women’s
               traditional economic independence, it has provided
               education and employment primarily for men. If women
               are educated, they are required to sever connections with
               their own traditions. Most women, however, seem to
               retain the traditional fabrics and dress longer than men
               do, indicating, perhaps, both their skepticism about the
               benefits of modernization and their attempt to keep their
               cultural traditions intact. Modernization has sometimes
               eroded the barriers which traditionally prevented women
               from using anthropomorphic and zoomorphic images and
               from carving in wood and ivory.15 In addition, since
               colonialism, wider markets for both old and new forms of
               women’s art have developed.
               Colonization and modernization have also had quite
               negative impacts on women’s artmaking. Institutions that
               once commissioned art produced by women, such as the
               refined tapa cloth used in Hawaii to wrap god-figures,16
               have often disappeared as the result of contact with West-
               ern missionaries. The basis for sharing resources by
               women and men has also changed. Baule women thread-
               makers lost their traditional ownership of the cloth men
               wove from their thread when it was replaced by manufac-
               tured thread.1” Many of the utilitarian arts—local cloth.
               decorated hides, baskets and ceramics—have been re-
               placed by imported cloth and plastic and metal containers.
               As traditional art forms are replaced by ones made from
               modern materials and by modern techniques, they may be-
               come rare commodities, sold to tourists and collectors.
               Through such sales the entire history of women s art may
               disappear from the culture which produced it.
               Although under modern influence women’s traditional
               arts may continue, usually new images, styles or
               techniques are developed. How have these changes
               occurred? What changes in quality and meaning take
               place when women artists use new materials and begin to
               produce art for unfamiliar buyers? With the expansion of</p>

               the marketing of their arts has their economic base been
               eroded or strengthened? And, in those cases where the
               women’s traditional art has disappeared, how do women
               adapt to this loss?
               We have reviewed some of the scattered evidence of the
               kinds of art women make in traditional societies and we
               have asked questions to stimulate further investigation.
               The few available in-depth studies were written mainly in
               the 1920s and 1930s by women anthropologists studying
               native American cultures.1“ These ethnographers ap
               proached their field research with the attitude that withir
               those cultures women’s participation was real, perhaps
               central, and as women they had greater access to informa-
               tion from women. Many of the questions we want
               answered now were not asked by them. In order to com-
               pile a more complete history of women’s artmaking, more
               ethnographies are needed, informed by feminist ideas.
               Women’s art from traditional societies excites us with its
               beauty and its relevance to life. We want to know more
               about the circumstances in which it is made, used and ap
               preciated. Only then will be begin to understand fully how
               women create culture.
               We are at the lakeside. To construct a feminist history
               of women artists we must consider all that has been writ-
               ten and unearth more. We must consider all that has been
               left out, as well. We must talk with each other, and out of
               the dialogue will come new ideas, new critiques. Through
               the superimposition of what we have known and what we
               are insisting on knowing, we can dispel the shadows which
               have remained too long.</p>

               tribes. These may include the making of figurines, symbol-laden pots,
               and wall decorations of shrines. It is unclear if women created figures
               for mbari houses, but they created portrait ceramics of ancestors and

               In the Table of Contents Phylane Norman was omitted as a contributor to
               “What Does Being a Lesbian Artist Mean to You?
               On page 22, the woman photographed is Lotte Jacobi, a German photog-
               rapher.
               On pagę 46, the photograph of Debbie Jones’s “Autoerotic Bowl” is by

               On page 72, the photograph of Louise Fishman’s “It’s Good to Have
               Limits,” was cropped incorrectly. The painting has an irregular, deckle

               Guidelines for Prospective Contributors: Manuscripts should be typewritten, double-spaced, on 8½“ x 11“ paper and submitted ir
               duplicate with footnotes and illustrative material, if any, fully captioned. We welcome for consideration either outlines or descriptions of pro-
               posed articles. These are due no later than one month prior to the deadline for manuscripts. If you are submitting visual material, please send :
               photograph, xerox or description—not the original. HERESIES will not take responsibility for unsolicited original material. Only manuscripts
               and visual material accompanied by a stamped, self-addressed envelope will be returned. HERESIES will pay a fee between 85 and 850, a-
               our budget allows, for published material. There will be no commissioned articles and we cannot guarantee acceptance of submitted material.
               We will not include reviews or monographs on contemporary women</p>

               Dear Lesbian Issue Collective:
               We appreciate all of the work the Lesbian Arts and Artists issue of HER-
               ESIES represents. We find it appalling, however, that a hundred years from
               now it will be possible for women to conclude that in 1977 there were no
               practicing Black and other Third World lesbian artists. It is not sufficient to
               explain such grievous omissions merely by stating: “. . . vet biases which in
               formed our choices of material were certainly conditioned by the fact that we
               are all lesbians, white, college-educated, and mostly middle-class womer
               who live in New York and have a background in the arts.” Feminist and les-
               bian politics and creativity are not the exclusive property of white women
               We would like to know if any of the hundreds of contributors you had t
               choose from were Third World women and if so to know more specificall
               the basis on which their work was rejected
               We look forward to your response.

               Dear Combahee River Collective:
               Although we did not systematically exclude Third World women from the
               Lesbian Issue of HERESIES, we did participate in a kind of passive exclu
               sion. The editorial collective that formed was all white. Our knowledge o
               the Third World artist or lesbian community was limited. By not making
               concerted effort to contact Third World Lesbian artists we became an only
               too typical all-white group operating in a racist society
               The inclusion of Third World contributions was based on the same cri
               teria applied to all work submitted to the issue. We don’t know exactly how
               many Black and other Third World women submitted work, but we re
               ceived nothing that specifically dealt with being a non-white lesbian artist on
               which spoke from an identifiably non-white position. As far as we know, the
               work of only one Third World woman was included in the issue. It is prob-
               able that we didn’t receive much work from Third World women.
               HERESIES has had a similar problem with every issue. Most of the ed-
               itors and contributors have been white women. As you may know, each
               issue of HERESIES is edited by a different group of women. Each issue is
               thematic and any women with an interest in that particular topic is welcome
               to work on the issue. We hope that, increasingly, Third World women wil
               want to participate in issues of their choice
               Also, though we haven’t done this yet, if a group of women approaches us
               with a proposal for an issue they want to put out themselves, we will con
               sider giving an entire issue to them to produce. A group of women who are
               already organized, such as the Combahee Collective, might want to do ar
               issue devoted to Black and other Third World artists. In this way we car
               begin to extend our publication to speak for many feminists who have noi
               been well represented so far
               As you pointed out, however, it is HERESIES’ responsibility to continue
               to print work by and about minority women (including Third World
               women, lesbian women, etc.) in each issue to avoid tokenism.
               We hope this information and your letter will encourage a greater effori
               on the part of both HERESIES editorial collectives and Third World
               women to enter into an exchange.</p>
            <p>
               HERESIES is planning to publish an issue on Black, Spanish-American, American Indian and other Third World women to
               be edited by Third World women. As with all HERESIES issues, the concept, content and design are to be decided solely by its
               editors. The issue, No. 8, is to be published in January 1979. Any Third World woman in the New York area who is interested
               in working on this should contact HERESIES immediately so that the core editorial group can form. Write us or call (212)
               431-9060.</p>
